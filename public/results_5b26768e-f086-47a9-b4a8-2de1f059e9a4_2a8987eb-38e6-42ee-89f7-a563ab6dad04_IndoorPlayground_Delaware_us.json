AHK has only ever played at one other in-door play park, and this one was unmatched. There are so many toys for her age, and height- she's TINY! Calming music streams through the speakers as you enjoy your play session. I loved that they offered food and beverages in the case you need one. There's an ample amount of room to store your belongings. They even have high chairs if you need to feed your little ones, and shared clogs so you don't have to enter the bathroom in just your socks!\n\nThe only negative I have to say about this particular location is the lack of steps on the play gym. There is ramp with grip, but it's pretty steep and tough to climb while guiding a small toddler. The only other option is a climbing wall, which again, not super easy to navigate to the top with your child.\n\nWe don't live in DE, but I would definitely recommend Natural Nest to others in the future!"

Was not the space I was expecting, but nice. There was no cafe from what I could tell, even though that’s what was advertised. Even as a SAHM the hours are very minimal. We did book a DIY party but I expected at least a little help from the staff.. the only part they DID help with was to charge people for socks and then remind us when it was time to leave. Overall not a welcoming experience and I have not taken my child back but am considering going to the Middletown location which has better reviews."

They allow their own children to run amuck in the facility, they do not treat visitors with kindness, and they seem to ignore any needs that arise. The bathroom had no paper towels or toilet paper, a big kid was playing on the slide and the entire structure swayed with their weight, the employees child was running around without a shirt…\nJust consistently disappointing. I would not recommend either of the locations to anyone."

I was asked to provide an estimated number of children, and I was told it didn’t need to be exact—just so they could ensure enough seating.\n\nHowever, on the day of the party, I was told I had to pay for the number I initially estimated.\nI explained that I planned to pay at the end, once I had a final headcount. When the party ended, I again explained that fewer children attended than expected. Despite this, I was told the owner insisted I still pay for the original number, which felt unfair and inflexible.\n\nWe also paid extra for the bubble machine, which turned out to be a complete nightmare.\nWithin 3–4 minutes, the first child slipped and fell due to the slippery puddles the bubbles created. I asked if the charge could be removed, as it created a safety hazard. The staff member attempted to clean it with a paper towel, which only made the mess worse. She said she would ask about the charge, but I was ultimately told I still had to pay. I then asked if we could at least move the machine to a safer location, since I was being charged for it.\n\nWhen I asked about resolving the billing issue, I was told to message someone, which I did.\nUnfortunately, the person who responded directed me back to the same individual at the facility who had already said she couldn’t help me. It felt like I was being passed around without any resolution.\n\nTo add to the frustration, our trash can was full, and I had to ask for another bag. While the young lady helping us was friendly and clearly doing her best, I feel that her supervisor failed both her and me.\n\nI really wanted this to be a great experience, but it ended up being more stressful than joyful."

          "content": "I was genuinely excited for Play Nest Café in Newark to open, as it’s much closer to me than the Middletown location. However, after today’s experience, I’d rather make the drive to Middletown, where the new licensed owner provides exceptional customer service. She’s attentive, passionate about her role, and goes above and beyond to ensure all families feel welcomed. Her love for what she does is clear—every child is treated fairly, and every parent feels included. That kind of atmosphere is what makes a business thrive.\n\nUnfortunately, Newark’s location has consistently fallen short of those standards for me. Today marked the third chance I gave this location to change my perspective, but it was yet another disappointing experience. I understand that we all have off days, especially as moms, but the consistent lack of effort to create a welcoming environment here speaks volumes.\n\nWhen my son and I arrived, the atmosphere was uninviting from the start. My son, full of excitement, was quickly met with situations that felt dismissive and unfair. Another child began snatching toys from him, and while her mother was distracted, the person in charge saw it all unfold yet chose to intervene only in favor of the other child. At one point, when my son happily tried to engage with the person in charge’s child, she physically pulled her child away from him, leaving my son visibly saddened. The lack of acknowledgment or effort to include us left me feeling incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nIn contrast, my experience at Middletown’s Play Nest Café has always been positive, thanks to the owner’s genuine care for families and her inclusive approach. Today’s experience reinforced the importance of hiring staff who align with a business’s values and understand how to make families feel valued. Sadly, this hasn’t been my experience at Newark.\n\nAs much as I love supporting small businesses, I cannot continue to spend my money at a location where I feel unwelcome and discriminated against, nor will I subject my son to such treatment. While the space is aesthetically pleasing, the experience simply doesn’t reflect the environment it should. If you value fairness, inclusion, and genuine customer service, I cannot recommend the Newark location.\n\nI got there at 12:00 pm exact and i left within 20 minutes due to how uncomfortable, depressing etc is was ."

Unfortunately, this is the second time we’ve had a negative experience at this particular location, which is why I’m writing this review. I do not recommend bringing your children here due to the poor service."

Plenty of seating for parents to sit and watch, and just enjoy watching their child play. Friendly staff too that came out often to organize all the toys so parents could focus on their kids.

Honestly, especially for  $16 I really expected a clean facility for my little one to play in. The main lady who greeted us was very sweet. The place itself is definitely much smaller than i imagined and felt a little underwhelming."

There’s lots of space, so if there are many kids, everyone can spread out pretty well, but you do need to keep an eye on your children. There are some height restrictions on certain attractions, but the staff rarely enforces them, and honestly, they seem miserable and bothered if you ask them questions. The staff's attitude can vary, with some areas being closed off, but others open, though nothing really prevents anyone from climbing on certain equipment. So, supervision is important. The video games are a bit overpriced, so you can burn through money quickly. Overall, I recommend the place except for the high prices on gaming. The only downside is the staff on the floor. They seem unhappy and not very attentive to the kids. The front staff is friendly and helpful when buying tickets. As long as you're watching your kids and staying alert, it’s not a bad place to visit."

Their is trampolines, ball pits, foam pits, obstacle courses, rock climbing, slides, tube slide with raft, balls to bounce around in I think they r called zorb balls not sure but those r cool as hell. All the workers appear to be high schoolers and they r all really nice and helpful. The price for both me and my sister to come here was 50$ for 90 minutes of all access play except for arcade games which r their own payment. Their was a lot of kids here when we came because their was some birthday parties but since the place is an old K-MART it’s really big inside and plenty of room to move around it don’t feel crowded at all. Honestly I was shocked by the cheap price of only 50$ and theirs so much stuff to do. I went to sky zone with my sister last year and it was like 80-90$ for 90 minutes and socks and there wasn’t hardly that much to do . This place is awesome I highly recommend checking it out."

We were 2nd ones there. The back corner trampoline had candy wrappers on it so the night before it wasn't cleaned. Not a big deal\n\nLoved that you can jump off the walls on the trampolines and do tricks. Long jump pads, tubing slides, ball pits. We were loving it UNTIL....\n\nWe went to play games. We swiped the game card twice and it took the credits bu game didn't work. I told the ONLY worker there and she pulls up our transactions. She tells me it swiped but didnt take our points. I said no, it took our points but the zero you see was the tickets from playing the game. After 5 mins she rudly said well I can come with you and use the store card but I cant credit your card. That's fine. She came over to the machine I told her wasn't working and she said \"watch\"! She swiped the store card and IT DIDNT WORK! my point proven.\n\nShe swipped the store card twice amd let us be. Fast fwd an hour, couple more employeedls came in. They opened hp the sections that you needed an employee (rope course, climbing tower, tubing). We're ready to leave so we missed out on those activities so plan you timing if you go and want to do those). We went to cash out the points. She literally ignored us at the counter. This place is dead at the counter. The cashier rolled her eyes at this employee and came over to help us.\n\nCome to find out she was the manager that was so rude. This matches the other reviews too. We won't be back."

She jumped off of it and she broke the zip line. Like how could you let a 25-year-old get on the zip line even though that’s for kids and two year old fly and doing backflips on the bounty trampolines that’s just unacceptable sky zone is much more funner than this place and the reason why I gave this to stars is because in the middle of the dodgeball arena there is a trampoline that can almost break your back This was the worst experience ever. It was only like 30 minutes long because the employees told us to leave, and some girl went up to my cousins and my cousin said I’ll get the next one, but then the girl said girls no we’re getting the next one cause you got the last one like what the heck I will never go to this placeAGAIN!!!! the pizza was good though, and some arcades didn’t even work and this is why I’ll never go to fun city again"

Anyone with sensory processing concerns will most likely be overwhelmed here.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend FunCity but you must be alert and on top of your child at all times.\nMy child had an absolute blast but I saved a 3 year old that couldn’t pull herself out of the ball pit and watched many other safety violations during our 1.5 hour visit.\nI would have given them 5 stars if there was more emphasis on safety."

Some older kids were seen hitting younger ones in a way that seemed intentional rather than playful, which could be dangerous.\n\nThe Zipline attendant was annoyed that my daughter changed her mind and did t want to proceed.\n\nThen I turn around and there’s a kid stuck hanging on the Zipline, thankfully a staff came with a ladder to help. Some kids didn’t meet the height requirement but were still allowed on.\n\nAdditionally, the air circulation in the building needs improvement. When it’s crowded, the smell becomes unpleasant.\n\nIt’s a fun place, kids were happy, but watch your child closely for their safety."

The place is fantastic and has tons of different things to do for all ages.\nWe thought the place was clean and we did see staff cleaning while we were there, which is always a plus. The bathrooms were clean as well. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helped us get all settled.The ball pit was HUGE for the younger ones. There are obstacle courses, slides, climbing walls as well as much more to do there. They do sell drinks and some snacks and candy but there isn't a snack bar or really much for the adults to have while they sit and watch their children play. They have tables where you can sit but I am not sure how full they get on the weekend since we were there on a Monday. It would be nice to have more seating in different areas since the kids are always on the go and some parents would want to keep tabs on them. The pricing is a bit high, It was $30 for 2 hours of play. I would say $15-$20 for 2 hours is more reasonable. There should be an hour extension offered for an additional $10\nWe will be back again though."

My son got his foot stuck in one of the rope nets, no big deal, but he did need some help getting untangled. The woman that he asked for help, who we later confirmed is the manager, decided it would be appropriate to tell my 10 year old that what he “needed was more exercise”. Not only was this extremely unprofessional of a “child friendly” facility, but also ruined the whole experience for my son and his siblings who also heard this interaction. If I could give zero stars I would. To have this be the “highlight” he remembers from his birthday party is heartbreaking to me."

There is also a roller slide that in all the times I’ve been here have yet to see a kid come off without a smile. This place has a ton to offer and is just great to visit."

It is always clean, everything is well maintained, and everyone always has a blast. I love how the adults are encouraged to participate with their kids and there’s lots of fun things to do without having a ton of extra money-sucking arcade games. They few they have let you play till you win.\n\nAs for the birthday party, the whole experience was amazing. We chose the meal package and literally everything was taken care of for us. All we had to do was send invitations and show up. Least stressful birthday party ever.  Our party host, Rashid, was friendly, attentive, and anticipated our every need or want. He really made sure everything went off without a hitch and made sure we were satisfied with everything throughout the whole event.\n\nI highly recommend Kids Empire for a day of fun or for a birthday party."

          "content": "Overall, the actual facility was fine, but I booked a party for 18. I was coming from out of town and arrived at 1:45 PM. The party was going to start at 2 PM. The room was empty so I asked if I could put this large sheet cake I was carrying in the room on the table. I was told no! I even indicated the room was empty. I just wanted to set this cake down and I would leave the room. I was told no. I brought a four year-old with me who wanted to start playing, 10 minutes early and they told me I had to pay an extra 21.99.  I stated that I had a party which they knew for $575 so couldn't they let my four year-old jump 10 minutes early. They said no. The rudest of the staff was a kid named Ben. He looked like he was about 12, but I assume he was 16. If my boys ever spoke to me the way this boy spoke to me they would've been grounded for life. I could give many examples but I won't. I will say the party was to end at 3:45 PM which I was fully aware and plan to be out of the room by then because I did not know if they had another party beginning at four. At 3:30 Ben comes in and informs me very rudely if I don't get out and that's a direct quote by 345 he was going to charge me for an additional hour for the party room and kids. There were two other girls there both Looked like they were 16. I only dealt with one other and she was just as rude.. I see when I arrived Because I was annoyed, they wouldn't let me set the cake down and the manager appeared from the back room. She said that I could go ahead and put the cake down in the room and then promptly left and I never saw her again."

She took a step on one of the pads and fell through, landing on the ground which was not padded at all. The padding has Velcro, which wasn’t attached and had a spring missing so she fell completely to the ground…back of her neck is scratched & swollen, along with her shoulder and a  bruise on her rib area. I know it’s a jump park and accidents happen but this is just ridiculous."

It took three tries to get the correct WiFi password but it still had an error and you can’t get on the internet. One out of three bathroom stalls had toilet paper. There was water all over the bathroom floor. The whole place felt dirty and not well kept. We tried it a second time. Half way through the kids play time we were told we had to have their brand of play sock on. This wasn’t the case on our first visit nor when we entered. We left. We will not be back. We’re also reporting several safety issues to the attorney general's office as there is not netting to prevent children from getting on top of the equipment more than 10 feet off the ground. This place is dirty and not safe."

It would be helpful to maybe do a quick wipe down of that area every hour. Everything else was really nice along with excellent service."

          "content": "Many previous reviews have discussed the lack of cleanliness and professionalism at this business. So my review will speak to the safety concerns I observed while my two kids were playing at the playground.\n\n1. Lack of netting above equipment. All major overhead areas of an indoor playground need to have fire and rip resistant netting to keep children from climbing over the sides of the equipment and suffering injury and death from a fall. Flyover park has a lack of this netting in any of their equipment that is above ten feet high. This is a direct violation of the ASTM industry standards, the group who licenses indoor playgrounds such as \"Flyover Fun Park\". Attached photos show the lack of netting where it needs to be.\n\n2. Lack of staffing for a playground of this size. When we were there, I observed four staff. One was in training, and one was behind the concession stand. I would also imagine this is what is causing the lack of cleanliness in the facility. Having this few staff means that the playground can't be correctly supervised and safety issues can't/ won't be addressed. At minimum, there should be six staff with two who are focused exclusively on children's safety. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told there wasn't one on site. This begs the question, who is in charge?\n\n3. Lack of public water: My kids were thirsty and I asked about a water fountain. I was told they didn't have one, and to buy a bottle of water. I understand this is a business, but profiting off thirsty children who are forced to pay for water seems a horrible way to make money.\n\nSeeing the recent negative reviews shows a lack of caring about customers, but I would have hoped Flyover would care about keeping kids safe. Clearly this is not the case."

They all kept busy and were great at keeping the establishment clean. There was so much to do there and all the equipment was clean, safe and in working order. The snack bar had a great variety of things and their pizza and funnel cakes were delicious! Also, between the snack bar and the tickets to get in, the prices can't be beat! We didnt play the arcade because truthfully my boys are just too young so I can't really give a review on the games. I can't wait to book birthday parties here because my kids had a blast and can't wait to go back with their buddies. Don't listen to all the bad reviews. You need to check out the place for yourself.

However, this last time I found the staff to be quite indifferent about a mysterious liquid pooled inside the castle bounce house. In my opinion they were not responsive  about any of it. In fact it remained open for the hour and a half that we were still there, allowing other children to presumably get their socks and pants wet. If you want parents to feel comfortable about bringing their children here you really need to be more proactive when it comes to safety / hygiene issues. My children and I took it upon ourselves to suggest that others stay clear. It's too bad I feel dissatisfied considering the amount of money spent there. Otherwise it was a five-star experience for the kids"

Our party assistant, Wendy, was very attentive, responding quickly to any of our requests, and did not make us feel rushed at all. I requested additional drinks and water to be brought out early which they happily accommodated; there is of course a limit to how many drinks are provided with the party package but we were allowed to purchase as many more as we would like.\nThe kids had an AMAZING time. Pizza was delicious! The party room was a nice size. We were allowed to put up our own decorations (with tacks which she provided for us) and we were allowed to set up 30 mins before.\nThere’s a nice sitting area for the parents to relax and enjoy as well. I’ve read previous reviews that unfortunately did not have the same experience but it seems there may have been some improvements made because we had a lovely time here! Kudos to Wendy for making our party experience wonderful ☺️"

Yes, gladly, give me a refund. NEVER have I been treated with as much disrespect as the manager treated me. She was making mocking faces and saying she ran this business for years.  I'm not sure what her problem was, but glad she's not my problem anymore. I guess they don't care since the business is for sale."

I'm honestly surprised they are in business.\n\nI booked this place for my son's birthday party, if you want your kids to stay hydrated, forget it. The drinks you pay for in the party package will not come out until the food comes which is after the hour of play time. You are not allowed to bring your own water in, I was told I had to take it back out to the car. There are no water fountains to use either and they do not provide courtesy waters for parties. They do this so you'll buy the $1/bottle water,  as a host that can add up if you are buying water for the whole party. I ended up taking the kids out to the car in groups so they could drink water at the car.\n\nAlso, if you book a party room, you are not allowed to utilize the party room until after the first hour, when the food gets there. I booked it 4-6 and was told I had to leave the room until 5. Do not and I repeat DO NOT since on the bench outside the room, it is wobbly, my father-in-law almost busted himself falling off it.\n\nFurthermore, do not talk to your friends at the party about the issues you are having with the party, the manager, Lynn Duphily, gets really mad and immature (mockingly immature) and will kick you out. I'm glad I got my refund and they didn't get an ounce of my money. To get the refund was an event in itself. After we packed everything up and everyone is waiting in the car, I went to get my refund receipt and was told \"You'll get your refund whenever she is ready to give it to you\". We left and had an amazing party elsewhere."

The lady on the phone also said to come 5 minutes early to decorate. So we did and they then informed me that we could t get into the room til “3” when the pizza comes . They did let us in the room 30 minutes early to decorate. The pizza came 25 minutes late and then they were very rude at telling us to leave the room because the other party was here . We let them know the pizza was 23 minutes late and that’s why we were late leaving the too . They do not give themselves enough buffer room for pizza being late and not enough time for families to decorate. No kid wants plain paper plates ,napkins at a party. Glad we brought our own decorations.  Will not be going back- it’s a circus -lack of communication"

I made it in very short notice and possibly the team didn't even know we were coming because I had sent emails trying to get information and to ask to update the party number count. No one gave us any direction about how the party was to go, just you are basically just renting the room and basic table covers plain paper plates and only forks and nothing was done beforehand thank goodness we had our own decorations.  We had 15 kids in our party that only accounted for 8 but we were the only ones there and plenty of staff who could have assisted in making things more fun for kids with direction and interaction.  You work at fun park, have fun come on! In the end it just seems no one was prepared for us and seems it would have been better to just have all our friends come without paying the extra money for the room. They did say we may could be on their commercial which would make the kids extra happy so I guess thats all that matters right? The kids had fun but wanted more time."

Because one time a 25-year-old woman went on the zip line and she jumped off of it. She broke the zip line and now no one could use it for the rest of the day some 22 year old were jumping on the jumpiest trampolines there were in that same exact Trampoline park and started doing backflips on it while two year-old went flying into the air. What the heck kicked these guys out bring back Ibp turn this back into a Kmart. I’ll never come here again. Be aware from this establishment and one time my cousins were going on the tubes and there were some rude people so my cousin said I’ll take the next one and the rude person said no I’ll take the next one because you guys took the last one. What the heck kick these guys out too and I heard a story about someone getting their foot caught in one of the things save someone and I almost drowned into the phone pit while some people were doing backflips off of one star never come here again Pizza is good though."

But let👏me👏tell👏you…this place is great for sensory seekers. I think a lot of bad reviews just come from parents that are either not watching their kids or others that aren’t. My daughter has no sense of spatial awareness and no sense of danger and every parent I saw was doing what they were suppose to. Parenting their kids. The staff is kind and very willing to help. I had no idea what socks would fit my kids feet and the lady was on point with all three. Loved that. And they just kind of hang back unless you need something. Loved that too. I didn’t feel that constant pressure for following a million rules while trying to let my kids have fun.\nI really enjoyed this place over past experiences at sky zone. We also went on a week night so it was pretty empty. Loved that also. It was a pretty penny I will say that. On our first go around for an hour and a half plus socks it was around $80. But I will say you get a lot of bang for your buck if your kids have as much energy as mine. The arcade is good too. My husband and son enjoyed it and you can win prizes and earn points for prizes. They have lockers for your shoes for $5. And my husband tried out the cotton candy machine and it makes these really cute designs. They also sell bagged snacks and drinks which is nice after running around. All in all I would recommend this place."

The prices are expensive though. I hope they open a membership soon like Urban air has. The playground is gigantic and has lots of things to do but BEWARE that the ball pit isn’t deep at all so make sure your kids don’t try to jump into it. There were only a few people here so we basically had the whole place to ourselves. It’s a great place to bring KIDS EIGHT or older because the attractions there are designed more for older kids like a zip line that you have to hold onto(Don’t worry there is foam blocks underneath so you won’t fall),a ropes course, a diving pit and a Ninja course. The trampoline area was also probably the biggest trampoline area I’ve seen. BE CAREFUL if you have little kids that like to wander off or cause mischief because many of the attractions there aren’t being monitored by staff so little kids could get in places where they shouldn't. The park also had a bobsled kind of thing that was really fun to go on. But you have to carry the bobsled up the staircase so again, if YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS, make sure that they don’t get hurt pulling it up. The place also had a dodgeball court that looked kind of small but I didn’t play in it so I don’t really know how it works. Overall this is a great place for older kids and we had a lot of fun here."

The woman that he asked for help, who we later confirmed is the manager, decided it would be appropriate to tell my 10 year old that what he “needed was more exercise”. Not only was this extremely unprofessional of a “child friendly” facility, but also ruined the whole experience for my son and his siblings who also heard this interaction. If I could give zero stars I would. To have this be the “highlight” he remembers from his birthday party is heartbreaking to me."

Adults can do the rock walls, trampolines…the foam pits are DEEP, especially where the jumping platforms and trapeeze are- getting yourself OUT of the foam pits is a feat in and of itself!! The timed tickets are great bc it sets a limit for those who are ready to go after a couple of hours. The tickets also include EVERYTHING- rock climb, zip\nlines, all of it- unlike other trampoline parks that charge extra for the extra fun stuff. The kids played hide and seek throughout the playground area and had a blast at that too. My only complaint would be that they do not have a food court- only vending machine type food- so camping out for the afternoon with a lunch break and more playtime isn’t an option (unless you purchase another timed pass) and hunger was a bit of an issue- but our time was up anyway so it all worked out.

They have an area with a blue slide and next to it is a red warp wall but kids kept trying to go down it like a slide and had to be told not to but there was no supervision there by staff members! they are still installing another slide next to those (purple) and its not ready yet but just blocked by caution tape that kids can easily ignore and get seriously hurt there! There should really be a barrier between the red and blue slide area so the top of the red cant be accessed by the climb through structure at all and there are stairs next to the purple one they are installing that can be used for the red warp wall if needed.  And all of that area is accessible from the climb thru structure. Plus that big ball pit area is only a foot deep so cant jump into it or will get hurt even just from the stairs into it. 🤦‍♀️"

First the price is outrages, I get they are big and have a lot of activities but they for and hour and half I spent $80 for just us three, they charge the parents the same as the child which is $26 for hour and half and for my 5 years old was also $26 my 2 year old was $18 for hour and half. Then everyone needed the socks which was 3.5 each. Going in they didn’t have enough staff for the size of the place and on a Saturday, I counted about 5 in total. Big kids and small kids were playing in the same areas, the play ground for toddlers is basically a maze trap, if your little ones don’t have you with them they will get overwhelmed and start cry or lost, I basically spent the whole time looking for my 5 year old. And my anxiety level was sky high. We left after 30 min. I wouldn’t recommend for kids 5 and under but it is a really awesome place for older kids for sure. Unfortunately excuse of the cost it wouldn’t be something you do on a regular basis, just too expensive and they don’t have any discounts or memberships. Hopefully they adjust."

Part of the reason I am so obsessed with the play cafe is because it is SO SAFE.  It's nearly impossible for my daredevil 2-year-old to get hurt.  My kids have so much fun!  They beg me to take them here every weekend, its so nice for them to be contained in a safe space and run and get all their giggles out.  There are different activities for different types of kids, and I have found this so accommodating.  My son is beyond active and wants to jump in the balls, climb, and go down the slide.  My daughter is quiet and reserved and loves the sand, books, and toy kitchen to play with.  This has also been a great spot for play dates and for my friends and me to enjoy any of the fun coffees or bubble teas while the kids are playing, having the time of their lives in a safe, contained space.  I seriously cannot recommend it enough! My kids have so much fun, and it is easy for me to relax, which is not usually the norm when taking my toddlers out.  We bought the class pack and that was more than worth it, especially with two kids.  The space is SO clean which is amazing!  The staff are constantly cleaning and sanitizing.  It makes me feel even more at ease.  There is nothing else quite like this in the Capital Region.  I cannot recommend it ENOUGH!!"

          "content": "When booking the Nestling party package for my daughter’s 1st birthday party, I didn’t see a Gracie’s Corner theme but Kama went above and beyond to make it happen! She communicated with me throughout the entire process. I’m at a loss for words at how she pulled all of the decor together and how beautiful everything looked. She understood the assignment! She was so accommodating and her service skills are excellent too! They took care of everything which was a huge weight off of me. The only negative was that their Bluetooth speaker wasn’t connecting to my device to play my playlist. Amirah, who was an excellent host, worked it out though and played my playlist from her phone. She was on point and on top of things! I was also able to play a slideshow for the adults who hung out in the cafe area. My family, friends and their children all had a great time. We will definitely be back for playtime and future events. Thank you Natural Nest Play Cafe!"

From start to finish, everything was seamless, stress-free, and so thoughtfully done. My daughter and her 14 little friends had an amazing time — she hasn’t stopped talking about it since!\n\nWhat I loved most as a parent was that we had the entire space to ourselves, which made it feel private, safe, and comfortable for all the kids and their families. The play area is clean, spacious, and filled with fun, age-appropriate toys and activities that kept the kids happily entertained for the entire party. No one was bored for even a second!\n\nThe party room was beautifully decorated with our chosen theme — princesses! There were colorful balloons, themed table settings, and cute little touches everywhere that made the space feel magical. The Nest team truly went above and beyond with the setup. They even took care of the goodie bags and organizing the food, which was such a huge help. I literally just had to show up with the cake!\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly, organized, and attentive throughout the event. They made sure everything ran smoothly and that both the kids and adults were having a great time. It was honestly one of the easiest and most enjoyable birthday parties we’ve ever hosted.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun, safe, and stress-free party venue for young children, I highly recommend The Nest. We’ll definitely be coming back for future celebrations!"

They helped with setup, checked in throughout the party, and made sure we had everything we needed. It was so nice to be able to enjoy the moment without stressing over the little details! Overall, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Our son had the best time, and all of our guests raved about how fun and stress-free the party was. We highly recommend The Nest Play Café for any toddler or preschooler’s birthday celebration! We’ll definitely be back."

But there’s just keurig and water cooler for hot water for tea. They could do way better.\nThe other issue is the lack of music…. We went and my kids were the only ones, along with the workers child playing. We could hear the daycare next door with screaming children and it was odd with no music.\nIt’s a cute setup, but my 4 year old was bored before the 2 hrs were even up. I think they do more to make it entertaining."

I liked the openess of the play area and that I didn't have to search for my child every two seconds. The toys and play equipment were super engaging and top tier quality. It made my preschool teacher heart happy lol.  I will absolutely be back with my littles!"

I took my son there for the first time recently where he was hurt. We were the ONLY people in there & my son started screaming crying, I was consoling him as best I could & not once did the young woman who was working turn around to see if everything was okay. My son IMMEDIATELY ended up with a huge knot on his head so I asked the woman if she had ice for me (to help the swelling) & I asked for a paper towel (to wipe his nose & tears) & she moved as slow as molasses. I had to politely ask her if she could please hurry with the paper towels & she then asked “yeah, oh did something happen to him?” -__- & I told her yes… I’m not sure how she did not catch on to that, again as we are the ONLY people in there, it’s a small and quiet place. After moving very slowly with no sense of urgency, she finallt gave me some ice wrapped in a paper towel (guess they didn’t have ice packs?) & some paper towels. I finally got my son to settle down & decided to leave to care for him further. As we are leaving, I said goodbye to her & she just says goodbye have a good day…no “is he okay, how did it happen, do you need anything else?” NOTHING… I am very disappointed, especially as a children’s establishment that they had such lack of care & concern. We will not be coming back here."

I drive all the way from Dover since this location is bigger (although I haven’t seen the new upgrade!), and it is well worth it.\n\nThe space is wonderful, extremely clean and everything is sanitized, and staff have been wonderful. You can’t beat the Sunday Birthday party price and I hope it never changes, so affordable!\n\nThe second birthday party I held for my 2 year old-back in April, I arrived and staff were still cleaning up from a previous event. I was stressed and panicking since we only have 30 minutes to set up-but the staff members were so kind and apologetic. One of the younger girls even asked if there was anything she could do to help, unforeseen circumstances happen and they handled it perfect.\n\nI do wish the child limit for the parties was a tad bigger, but that’s only because I always invite too many kids 😂. Hey,  more kids and families that attend, that’s essentially more free advertising through experience 🤷🏼‍♀️😂.\n\nI applaud this business. The owner is so kind that she was even able to sponsor a local family in the community who is struggling. Can’t wait to visit again and have more great experiences here!"

They were still decorating  room as guests arrived  it was extremely unacceptable And had their children assisting them who were not dressed appropriately! Another staff member had a crying baby in the play area upon our arrival.\n\nIt was evident that this party was not important to them as it was a rushed job. The decorations started to fall down. The inflatable animals kept deflating when they could have easily went to a party store or walmart to replace it. A custom sign that was purchased was no where to be found, There was no evidence of a themed activity. The staff was incompetent in orchestrating a party game and gathering the children together. This was the worst experience we have ever had and I would not recommend this business. The owner stated that they were understaffed and if so they should have arrived 2 or more hours ahead to ensure that it was taken care of when people have paid for a party! They did not make our experience enjoyable at all and did not make an effort to make sure that this party was up to standard.\nThey need to take time to properly train staff, replace inflatables when they are no longer working properly, buy decorations, and make sure the rugs  and play items are clean before guest arrive. Nest is a nice place but they have to get organized and invest in the things that matter! Please think twice before booking with this business"

          "content": "I recently visited Natural Nest Cafe during its advertised hours of operation on Thursdays and Fridays, from 8 AM to 4 PM. However, upon arriving at 1:45 PM, I found the store dark, doors locked, and no visible activity inside. Despite attempting to call several times, there was no answer.\n\nHaving managed businesses for family members, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to closures or early closure for various reasons. However, upon checking their social media pages for any communication about an early closure, I found none.\n\nIn an attempt to gather more information, I called their Dover location, where the person who answered provided minimal information. They mentioned that if there were no reservations past 2 PM, they may close early, despite my arrival at 1:45 PM.\n\nThis experience highlights a lack of respect for both the company's stated hours of operation and its customers. Their website clearly states: 'Reservations are encouraged but not required for our 2-hour blocks of open play.' and 'We offer Open Play, Classes and Event reservations online to ensure you have a spot to play as we have limited play capacity. Drop in is offered on an as available basis only. Please call ahead.' Their website clearly states that reservations are encouraged but not required for open play, and drop-ins are accepted based on availability.\n\nAfter reading other reviews mentioning other inconsistencies, and considering the significant distance I traveled (nearly 30 minutes) to visit their party space, I'm disappointed and unwilling to invest further time in visiting this establishment. It's worth noting that I solely intended to see the party space before blindly booking online and had no interest of play time during this visit. I could only imagine the further disappointment if I had children eager to play with me."

I do not support this company.\n\nWe got to check out The Nest Play Cafe during soft launch today and it was an absolute blast. You can reserve a play time online or do a drop in play, however, to guarantee your spot, I recommend booking a slot online. Each slot is a 2 hour period. There is tons for kids of multiple ages to explore and play with and since it’s in soft launch, the arrangement of the room will most likely change. There is plenty of seating around the room for caregivers and well as a whole cafe to parents of independent kids to work on their laptop or grab a coffee. There are shoe cubbies for shoes and socks are required in the play area. If you forget socks, they do sell them at the front desk. There is a whole book area for older kids to sit and read while the younger kids play. There is a family bathroom for use and there is a changing table as well as a small portable potty for kids. They even had spare diapers and pads! We can’t wait to visit again and are looking into their membership option.\n\nThe only recommendations I would have would be a locked area for people to put purses and/diaper bags and having the play period include 2 adults and 1 child instead of charging for additional adults, to mirror similar local play places."

          "content": "I was one of the moms that attended the Bluey event Dec 3rd.  This was my first time at this establishment and it is mainly for children up to 3 years of age even though an 6 year old would just adapt to the environment. This was a Christmas event and I must say there was nothing that I saw that stood out to be Christmas at all. My daughter was the only child wearing a Christmas hat for the Christmas theme.  I thought that Bluey would have had on a Christmas hat like shown on the website. Where was the Christmas tree? Why weren’t the owners dressed in Christmas gear as the organizers of the event because I certainly was dressed for the cause as an adult.  The activities were vague and some of the children and parents didn’t even know some activities were happening because it was unannounced and unorganized.  For the price, I thought the activities were going to be more structured according to the events that were listed.  We didn’t know that our children could make gingerbread houses until we were leaving because there was no announcement of this activity. We saw little children in the corner which prompted our children to join in which made us stay an extra 15-20 min to do this activity. There is nowhere on the website that you need grip socks to play.  It just said socks! Most people sign waivers when they get to an establishment so this should have been clear online when you check out. The children who needed socks were charged $5 for non-grip socks.  Why don’t they sell the socks that are required?  We asked for a refund only when we learned that some of our children didn’t have the proper socks to play and they were going to be denied play time with Bluey. I have been to hundreds of events and have paid high and low for my child to experience fun, however, this was not what I expected. This review is not to deter you from visiting this small business but for this business to gracefully understand and respect the review and experience of their customers in hopes to do better. The idea was there, it was just poorly executed."

They not only charged me 10% for this, they also cancelled the order and charged the fee, despite my willingness to keep the order.\n\nThis vendor tried to make $38 off me, knowing the item wasn't in stock. I've involved my bank to get my money back. Don't make the same mistake. Buy from the official Gathre site. If it's \"out of stock,\" it truly is.\n\nIn short, this vendor's deceitful actions show they're a complete scam. Don't fall for it."

A little more explanation would be good (f.e. „Help yourself to the coffee over there“). The concept is very close to Maria Montessori’s theory’s of learning. Everything is made of wood or organic material, non-toxic and in sober colors. It was equally attracting our baby and our 5 year old. We loved the relaxing music! Everything was extremely clean. Some suggested improvements: a step stool for toddlers would be great in the restroom. And a little further training in coffee making skills. 😊"

They have plenty of spots for parents to sit and watch their little ones play. It was really nice and a great addition! They have snacks for Littles and adults, plus free coffee and water! Great and fun atmosphere. Highly recommend. I wish they let parents come for free or did a deal like buy one parent ticket get the other free because I would love to bring my husband next time. Overall amazing experience!! Deff try it out on a hot or rainy day when you need your kids to burn off energy!"

We will 100% be signing him up for the science and music classes. Ashley was a responsive and generous host to the group of littles.\n\nMusic for grownups without lyrics and a classical version playing; very comfortable seating options for us, where you can easily keep an eye on your kid, they prioritize safety and cleanliness. The toys and activities for kids are top of the line, amazing quality, and spark joy and creativity ❤️\n\nThanks for a great first visit, we will be back soon with more friends!}"

All the party attendees loved the space and the fun, unique and engaging activities.  Ms. Tai was absolutely fabulous in helping us get set up, making sure the party was running smoothly and then cleaning up.  We had mostly young children but even my 10 year old son was totally entertained by the toys and activities.  This was our first time visiting the Playhouse and I can't recommend it enough for a party or an open play session.  My only complaint is that I was worried that I was forgetting something because Ms. Tai made everything so easy and relaxing for us parents! LOL.

We first met Tai when she was teaching Zumbini classes out of different locations, and have stuck with her ever since! She’s so warm, friendly, silly and fun in the best ways that really engage the kids and she’s made the space inside Harmony kids just the same. It’s super clean and laid out with so many thoughtful little areas with different toys and activities for the kids. My kids rave about going there and always ask when the next time we can go back will be.\n\nWe just hosted my son’s fifth birthday party there and Tai made it so much easier on me by offering a decorations and food package so we didn’t even have to provide those in advance. As a full time working mom of three (ages 5 and under) that kind of help was crucial for the success of our party. We also chose to include a music session during the party, which was perfect and had the kids all dancing and playing along. 15/10, we love Harmony Kids Playhouse!"

However, when I came back, I was informed that the items had been taken—presumably stolen—despite your staff’s assurance that they would be kept secure!\nThis situation is extremely upsetting and has caused me both inconvenience. I trusted your staff to act responsibly, especially after being given a direct assurance that my belongings would be protected. It is unacceptable that this promise was not honored, and that no adequate measures were taken to prevent this from happening.

We entered the building and we spoke with a young lady at the desk, who was being guided by this man, presumably the manager. She explained that we needed to purchase socks in addition to the entry ticket, so we purchased the one pair of socks for my daughter to play. Precisely upon completing the purchase, the man informed me that I would not be able to bring my stroller into the play area. Total deal breaker. I’m sure they’re aware that once they inform a guest that they can’t bring the stroller with them, most patrons would turn away. So they’re waiting until the purchase is complete to inform you that the stroller can’t come with you. Either change the policy or tell people before they purchase. So the play area itself had a few parts that either weren’t working, or none of the kids could figure out how to make it work. None of the workers stepped in to show a demonstration or explain. My daughter did enjoy herself, but I did not enjoy needing to carry all of my belongings around with us on top of my 22 pound baby in a car seat."

Fast forward 3 days before the party I call to confirm the party. The teenager working tells me they don’t have record of the party. I ask to speak with a manager. She puts me on hold then another teenager proceeds to get on the phone and is NO help, telling me there is no manager and I’ll have to call back tomorrow. Five minutes later I get a call from them with the phone number for the party manager. I call this number twice, no answer. I texted it and finally got a reply. After some back and forth the person informs me that whoever booked the party never confirmed it and they don’t have any spots available for Saturday. I booked this party 2 MONTHS in advance and I never heard from them at all after booking. I was so disappointed because we had to scramble to find something else to do from my daughter’s birthday. I am very lucky I called because we would have been extremely screwed if we showed up there on the day of the party. Honestly, they need to do better and have more adults who can assist rather than leaving it all up to teenagers."

My child was hit by rough housing from an adult! The workers were in the area and did not seem to care. My daughter had a good time but the lack of etiquette ruined it for us. Would not recommend for kids under the age of 2 when it’s busy. There’s no crowd control, it gets packed, and parents aren’t careful with other children."

They charged the maximum amount without explaining that the tokens are for games that don't actually work. There are no attendants to keep an eye on the bounce houses and they are not divided by age or height. I had to rescue our child from a inflatable snow globe that deflated, so it was essentially a giant plastic bag with kids inside. One employee watched it happening and did nothing. The scooter rides are fun but would not go back strictly for that."

We have come twice and both were very cold days and I just think for a place that is so centrally located and where there is access to a lot of public transportation that there should always be more kids.  However I think it's because it's too expensive.  Most places give you a discount after the first child. What's nice is how the 2 air hockey and 1 Foosball table are included in the gold package. But the package above gold for $10 more included 1 inflatable more that just blew balloons around but no jumping. In both packages 1 ride is included for 12 minutes which I see a lot of kids get off sooner. There are 2 basketball hoop games and 1 has balls that are all deflated and after you use your 2 coins they give you, it's $2 for maybe 2 minutes which is why it's always available.  Employees are very nice and helpful."

Every other activity or toy required an additional fee. Literally everything. This place felt more like a store than an actual indoor playground.\n\nIf you’re already at the mall and your kids want to play, it might work as a quick solution to keep them entertained. However, we drove 40 minutes for just 30 minutes of playtime, plus $11 per hour for parking. It was my first and definitely my last visit.\n\nAlso, please lower the volume of the music. The noise doesn’t make it any more fun, especially when there aren’t other kids around."

Once he's available, he doesn't give you coins for the machine. He puts in one coin to get the machine started and then walks away. If you want to play another time, you have to track him down. By that time, you lose interest. We paid for the $20 package for 2 kids each, which was ridiculous. You're better off going to the arcade near the AMC. The toys are all overly priced and are all fake knockoffs and look terrible. Once you get on the motorized cars, you only have 12 minutes to ride in a small circle in front of the store, and the employee will watch you like a hawk making sure you don't get any extra time pass 12 mins and your not trying to get an extra ride. My daughter is 3, and she seems to enjoy the bounce house, but that's all. For the experience I've gone through, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."

Emily and Rebecca are always so kind and welcoming, and you can tell how much time and passion Emily pours into making the space special.\n\nThe variety of toys and activities keeps my child engaged every time we come. I love that the furniture and play areas are frequently rearranged—it keeps things exciting and new, even for regular visitors like us. They also host fun, events throughout the year. We recently attended an Easter egg hunt, and I really appreciated how thoughtfully it was set up so little ones weren’t overwhelmed. It was my daughter’s first time meeting the Easter Bunny and I am thrilled she had a positive experience.\n\nSometimes there’s even a themed sensory bin or fun surprise—like the day we came in and there were balloons on the wall, which my child noticed right away. There’s a cozy, clean area for nursing mothers, complimentary coffee for parents, and a snack area with child-sized tables and chairs—such a thoughtful touch. I also love the no-shoes policy, which helps keep the space clean and comfy for the kids.\n\nIt’s such a welcoming environment, and we always look forward to our visits. I recommend this place to any family looking for a safe, engaging, and thoughtfully designed indoor play space!"

Attendees were limited and allowed for the children to play and participate in activities without being directly on top of one another. Included in the 1.5 hour event was play, snack, a craft, and character appearance; I felt that event was well priced for these inclusions. The space was very clean and well maintained. I appreciate that toys and activities are rotated for seasons, holidays, etc. I would highly recommend open play sessions or special events to those who have kiddos 1.5 to 3 years old- this gem of a business is perfect for them and we are so lucky to have it in our community!"

My sister in law was telling me all about it when they opened, I wasn’t sure what to expect, and to my surprise this was like no place I’ve ever taken my 4 year old! As soon as you walk in, it’s very bright atmosphere, smells great and VERY CLEAN!  Everyone took their shoes off prior to entering the play area where they have multiple interaction sections for each creative child and all their desires.  Also the fact that there were 10 toddlers in the same room and the volume was at a 4 out of 10 I was highly impressed that something like that was even possible lol. They were so extremely engaged that everyone played so nice and quiet at each stations. Also if any of the toys are some how soiled (ie, child places fake veggie in the mouth) there is a dirty bin where you place all toys to be sanitized!! Trust me , Emily did not miss a single detail! These are things I highly value as a parent.\n\nThere was an area in the back with flooring as an area to eat and have snacks off the carpet play area.\n\nIn the back hall there was a lovely breastfeeding room with a cozy chair and privacy curtains and fully loaded diaper changing station!!\n\nThis place was a dream come true for a mom (or any guardian for that matter)\nAnd even to this day my toddler keeps asking to go back!\n\nI had to stop in and support our local businesses that build such beautiful space  that keeps our community connected!!"

I went today with my autistic 5 year old twins and their nurses and I was worried it wasn't going to go well since they have issues in social settings and are often judged for being different than the other kids. We did not experience this at all and felt very welcomed. Lots of things to do to keep the kids busy. There is even a room in the back that can be used as a calming room which is a huge plus for us since the boys get overstimulated easily. We will definitely be coming back again. I wish great success for this small business."

The owner is extremely nice and was on top of everything making sure everything was picked up, cleaned up and has a special little bin for toys, the children put in their mouth so they can be sanitized, the place is extremely clean. Free coffee in the back, nursing area to have some privacy and free diapers and wipes are even offered. For the price and with anything included it’s such a great deal. We will definitely be back whenever we get the chance ❤️"

There is a wide variety of play structures such as a beauty salon, grocery store, garage, indoor playground, and many more to allow for all different types of imaginary play. The owner was extremely warm, polite, and welcoming which added to the wonderful experience. I highly recommend for anyone with children under the age of 10!}"

He did enjoy some of the play structures but my 4 stars is mainly for cleanliness and the overall look of the facility. It appeared to be very dirty especially the play mats and some of the structures just look very unclean. There were also a lot of things like the ball guns that just didn’t work at all, or caution tape around things, it just didn’t look very presentable. When my kiddo is older I’d deff prob come back just not on the weekend. Pretty packed and most don’t watch their children leaving them to knock down or throw things at younger kids. We will stick to totsville for now"

Unfortunately, today we were unable to enjoy our party with constantly being followed around by the new host to the point where she climbed up on a playground to deliver the bill mid party. There was no organization or Communication!,  to be honest We would’ve operated better without a host. it was more like being policed & rushed out the room.\nAnd as for the  manager Yaya whom Completely lacks customer service to start with she wasn’t allowing Guest due to the fact that we paid before their arrival, we wasnt not notified  about our guest & took 5minutes for her to understand that we’re willing to pay for the xtra children, and unfortunately, she’s telling my guess it’s a $21 fee perchild yet told me right in front of them that it was a $17 fee.  the way miss yaya sat outside the party room staring through the window at 7:10 pushing for is to leave At 7:15 is when we was suppose to clean up. Remind you where the last party of the day at that point, the only party of there. We basically got treated like we were unwanted and thieves for having a birthday party. I didn’t get the assitant managers name, but she has been nothing but outstanding customer service and understanding should be the main one managing!!\nI really wish I would’ve took pictures, but I was trying to enjoy my child party & like i said I would  recommend location birthday parties unless you want completely surcharged for lack of Communication & a headache."

They made my family feel safe, as we saw them handle serious altercations among feuding patrons. Some of Kidzville’s clientele is unsavory, and you need strong, armed men there to deter and address dangerous behavior. Please beef up the security presence again, or my family will not feel safe spending time at Kidzville anymore."

Adults have to wear socks too, so if you’re throwing a party have the forethought to put that on the invite. They got a little too excited about making me buy socks when I was only wearing sandals. Seems a little scammy and overpriced. Lots of better options for a birthday party in the area. Would not recommend."

Highly impressed with everyone here.\n\nactively engaged in watching and helping kids.

Not sure why she had two phones to do a transaction. Never gave me a receipt, I didn’t sign. Just gave me tokens and two wristbands. Once I got home I checked my bank and saw the place charged me $75. When I called to ask them about it, they gave me the run around and made me talk to several people then told me I needed proof I was there and charged that amount because they have no transaction in their system for the time frame I was there, for the amount I was charged or the correct amount. However, I have pictures and videos of being there at the time frame mentioned and we were the only family there the entire time. It seems like they have some sort of scam going on. I do not recommend at all! Please pay attention and get a receipt!"

          "content": "I brought my granddaughter, who's almost 3. It kept her interest for about 20 minutes.  I was wondering why on the Saturday there was no one else there when we arrived. The cost was $25 to jump on the 2 bounce houses, basketball game and another few arcade games ( It was the hockey puc game and I believe one more) and also to drive around on their remote dinosaurs Which she did really like. She took a dinosaur ride and then went back in for a few minutes and then wanted to ride on another dino. When we asked, we were told that we would have to pay again to ride on the other dinosaur.  Decided To leave shortly after that. In my opinion it wasn't worth the $25. It was the first play place that hasn't captured her interest for a long period of time. At other play places she would play for 2 hours or more. It would have been nice if they had a little ball pit for some of the younger kids to play in. We won't be returning."

Especially for toddlers, I came in with my newborn (sleeping in stroller) my 20 month old son and 3 year old niece who were sleep deprived and little terrors lol! They didn’t want to shop anymore so I took them and let my sister do what she needed. The lady there helped me so much! She helped take rides on the little power pets around the front of the store! Played the games with the kids so I could tend to the other one, etc. I would have been sweating, and running between all 3 kids and she made it a breeze! She went Above and beyond!! Plus it’s super affordable and just an awesome vibe for toddlers! She asked if the music was too loud for my sleeping baby, she was super attentive and I will be returning!!"

A lot of the guests for our party arrived late and the employees were mindful of this and allowed us to have our pizza/cake time after our designated time. We appreciated them extending that kindness. Our room was decorated nicely and I appreciated not having to add much to their standard decor. The overall play space is decent, albeit, it’s definitely on the smaller side. Our party room was meant for 10 children and 10 adults, but it was very tight and several of the adults didn’t feel comfortable coming in as it felt too cramped. For the price they charge, they should definitely allow kids to continue to play after the 2 hour party slot. They expect another $22 per child after  your $500 2-hr party… on top of that, the area remains open to the public and it gets way too crowded, especially when you have little ones. It costs about 2k to reserve the entire space. We were fortunate that it wasn’t too busy at the time we had our party but I wouldn’t bank on that being  typical experience for this place. All in all, the staff was friendly and helpful, the space was fun for small children, but definitely way too small and priced high."

With the party they decorate the room- and the basic decorations they supply are absolutely stunning. I got the basic birthday package and the ballon’s and decor were amazing. They even gave us invitations with a QR code to the waiver. The park itself is a blast, very clean, and meticulously maintained. The customer service was out of this world. Anything we needed they were there at a moments notice. When they saw my son’s cake was Mario themed they surprised us with Mario coming to the party. The kids were so excited. This was a party my son will never forget and I won’t either because the customer service and entire experience was out of this world. 10/10 cannot recommend enough."

Despite being a busy holiday, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better. The play equipment was impressively clean, showing the care and effort put into maintaining the facility.\n\nOne of the standout features for us was the high weight limit on the equipment, allowing parents to join in the fun without worry. It’s also fantastic that parents enter for free – a thoughtful touch that sets this soft play centre apart from others.\n\nThe entrance fee being a whole-day pass is excellent value, and we appreciated the flexibility it gave us. Our two-year-old absolutely loved exploring all the different areas, and we would have stayed even longer if we didn’t have other commitments.\n\nOverall, we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend Kidz Jungle World to anyone looking for a fun, family-friendly outing. It’s a perfect spot for kids to play, laugh, and burn off energy while parents can relax or join in. A solid 5/5 experience!"

I’m thankful for their care of their customers and making accommodations even at the last minute. The kids had fun and so did the adults!"

Over the past two years the gun machine have never been working when we go. Now the machine that makes the balls pop up doesn't work. And the tube that sucks up balls also doesn't work and so that means the area where the balls collect cannot be used to make all the balls fall down. The tree swing was gone and the metal Zipline that my son lives was also broken. The floors felt sticky. I feel like this place is on the decline. I hope they get it together. It's very disappointing. We come here often because it's close to my house and the kids love it. In fairness they did still have a good time. So one star for customer service and one for the kids having a good time."

Take your child here if you want to tire him/her out.\n\nOne of the things that stood out was the front desk employee Arnetia. You can tell she genuinely loves her job! I observed her and she treated everyone with such kindness. We came near closing time and not once did we feel rushed to leave. The entire time she kept busy mopping and cleaning (which by the way as soon as you walk in you can smell the cleanliness of the place). When she wasn’t cleaning she was happily engaging with the children making sure they were safe. It’s rare that I meet someone with such a gentle and sunny disposition. Arnetia is the kind of employee you want representing your company. I hope someone in corporate reads this. Keep hiring employees like her and you’ll stay in business for years to come."

The staff has timely communications, is very friendly and is very attentive even to last-minute changes. The birthday packages are flexible and very reasonably priced.

The woman working was phenomenal in making sure the environment was clean and safe and went above and beyond in showing me a easy way to the slide for me and the littlest one to slide down together without having to climb through the whole structure. Additionally, she went out of her way to show the kids how to fill the foam ball blower so that the balls cascaded everywhere to the delight of the children. The largest play structure has a variety of passages, but all of the entrances and exits are condensed toward the front for easy viewing from the two smaller play areas where parents would accompany younger children allowing them to also keep and eye on their older ones. We can't wait to go again in the future!"

The employees made it fun for everyone including the adults. We were all running around trying to find golden eggs with the kids and it was just a time. Please let your employees know what an amazing job they did. 10/10 experience, even on a regular day the employees are always amazing and do their jobs accordingly and in a timely manner."

Love the bright colors. I would have given 5 stars, however there’s a door to nowhere next to the trampolines that many kids were confused about. And right next to that are cubbies that are not attached to the floor or anything; that, when leaned on topple over. This is a major safety hazard, especially with all of the kids running back and forth. They should take the purple cubbies next to the dirt to nowhere and block that door, which would give the cubby stability and the kids no longer have a dead end when trying to find the entrance to the trampolines. Some signs on that side saying, “this way/that way” for the entrance to the trampolines might help as well. We got trampled, bumped into or had awkward looks given by so many sweet babies who were confused as to how to get to the trampolines."

We were not disappointed. So many things to do, extremely clean, friendly staff. Music playlist was well chosen and at perfect volume---enough to hear, if listening, but not intrusive if occupied in play. No shoes for all (including adults), and slip ons available at the bathroom entrances were impressive. We happened to stop by on a Friday. ALL-day play till 8:00 at a great price. We stayed 3. If not happy with the menu, you can leave and come back. Broad hours of operation (9-8:00-except Sunday till 6:00) make it convenient for most families.\n\nI've only written 2 reviews online (including this one). If I could have given both higher stars, I would have. I went to their website when I returned home and was surprised to see the overall rating, UNTIL I read the reviews. Look people, Junior Playland just opened in November. They're still working out the kinks---to be expected. Refreshing to see management respond to some reviews. If you are going (by choice or necessity) on a Saturday (especially) or Sunday, of course, the place is going to be more crowded. Also, my opinion--be fair---1 bad/good review per group, then just don't go back, if not happy. Otherwise, it doesn't give an accurate overall rating. Let's face it---stuff happens. Management seemed fair in how they handled those situations. One last thing---it's the adult's responsibility to monitor their child's play. Remove them from a situation, if you don't feel comfortable. Needless to say, we'll be back often in spite of the hour ride to get there."

          "content": "EDIT IN RESPONSE TO OWNER REPLY:\n\nWe tried to address it but you have been unresponsive to my email outreach and no phone call has been returned. You seem to only respond on Google reviews vs. actual outreaches. On the day of the party there was not a staff member on hand above high school age to assist or address our concerns. And the following day when I stopped by to discuss, you were again not available.\n\nI don’t know who Ann is, but I’m sorry to hear she had a similar poor experience.\n\nHaving your friends post fake reviews to counter actual reviews from people who had poor experiences to try and stay above a 4 star rating is a questionable business practice.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nDon’t recommend them for birthdays. They jam as much possible business into 1 hour room windows which robs people of set up time for their parties and also has new parties going into unsanitized rooms. The whole process is very chaotic and disorganized and if you aren’t actively policing the time yourself, they will not be helping you. There doesn’t appear to be an actual process they follow to support birthday parties.\n\nThey also do not have any process for crowd control. They sell two hour windows for play/parties, but they do not enforce a policy to actually ensure people leave after their window ends. This makes it unreasonably overcrowded, especially as the day goes on. Most places close for a period of time to ensure integrity of the play windows and allow parties the ability to get set up and not worry about encroaching on or being encroached on by other parties.\n\nOther play places in the area are better positioned for these parties, and I would recommend choosing them for your sanity and to not waste $700 on a free for all setup."

People were not even getting checked in nor were time slots being verified. It was absolute chaos all over the play areas\n\nWhen it was time for our party room there was zero coordination. I had to find our room myself and get all our guests into the room (they told me the wrong room number) AND THEY LOST ALL OUR FOOD AND CAKE. An employee literally walked me from party room to party room looking to see if other parties were being served and eating our food! Finally they took me down to the area behind the desk where they all proceeded to just stand there yelling at each other with no one knowing where our stuff was. Eventually I walked past the arguing employees and went to look for it myself and found it was tucked in the back of the storage area.\n\nEven though we were within our guest count for the package we purchased there was not enough room in our room, we had guests sitting on the floor eating pizza with their kids. Additionally, our package included juice and utensils, which we never got and had to ask for forks for our cake ourselves.\n\nWhen we asked to talk to a manager a teenager came over and said “it’s not our fault”\n\nUpon returning back home, we realized that an employee had collected some of the gifts from our guests when they entered but we never received them. So our daughter is now missing some of her birthday gifts.\n\nI was so embarrassed by this entire party and I spent the night apologizing to our guests and sending up follow up apology messages to our attendees. For how much we spent on this I cannot believe this is what we got…\n\nEDIT IN RESPONSE TO OWNER’S RESPONSE:\nI disagree with this rebuttal, the owner was not present so I am relaying my experience. I personally was taken from room to room to look for our food while other people were having their parties (as I mentioned earlier). It was not located in five minutes and I was the one who found the food myself and had my husband personally go down to carry the cake up himself in fear of another mishap.\n\nI did not mention the power outage as I understand this was not in anyone’s control and all the concerns I’ve outlined occurred prior to the power outage. However, if the gifts were meant to be delivered to the room as part of set up and the power outage happened after we were in our room, then how did the power outage affect visibility of the gifts in storage?

The child’s mother found it after 6 teenagers were trying to manage a clearly over capacity crowd and they were clearly overwhelmed.  A manager over the age of 18 should be onsite.  The power went out, which was out of everyone’s control but no one offer assistance or flashlights to illuminate very dark party rooms.  All in all a difficult experience, especially for the child.  We are rushed out of the room at the end of the hour with our guests telling us they left the child’s gifts with the front desk at check in.  Too bad the front desk did not deliver the gifts.\n\nEdit in response to owner,\nI was one of the last people to leave the place.  No gifts were left on the sidewalk as none of us were given a bag of gifts.  So, how did the gifts get outside on the sidewalk?"

Also it didn’t appear the 9-11 session got formally “kicked out” which could account for the overcrowding. It would be nice if they closed for 30 minutes between sessions to clean because nothing was in its right spot (eg. doctor kit in play hospital, food in play store). Also the layout feels tight, there’s a spinning attraction with balls hanging from it and people trying to walk by kept getting whacked. We’d probably go again but it would be nice if these kinks could be ironed out.}"

If you’re the kind of parent that needs to stand over your kid while they’re in a space like this, I’d recommend you stay away for a bit. At one point there were so many parent hovering over kids in the ball pit or up in the play spaces, that it was hard for other kids to go down the slides and get around. Just give the kids some space while still keeping an eye on them and it will be fine.\n\nI’d definitely go back."

We had 30 kids attend and Wheezone did a wonderful job handling all my party needs. Everyone had a great time, kids aged 2-12 for a great price!\n\nAll the staff I interacted with were friendly and very accommodating, starting with the owner. I had two party hosts, who took care of setting up the decorations and goody bags that I brought, passing out pizza and cutting the cake. All communication with the owner leading up to the day was handled seamlessly and quickly via email or via phone call, which I greatly appreciated.\n\nI was set up in the back due to my larger party size, which was very spacious for kids to sit and eat and adults to sit while the kids played.\n\nThe food was delicious. I ordered Alfredo pasta, Chicken fingers, veggie pizza, meat lovers pizza, and cheese pizza. The icecream cake was enjoyed by all.\n\nI highly recommend Wheezone for your kids party. You won't be disappointed!!!"

          "content": "Update: recently returned with my kids being 3,6&8 all had a great time again! I just want to say a LOT of children were climbing up slides creating a very dangerous situation for themselves and the children using them properly. My six year old did hurt her ankle because a child crossed over her slide climbing up while she was sliding down properly and she went into him very hard. The staff was making announcements to stop, however the same children repeatedly were not listening. They need to specifically go to these children’s parents and possibly remove the kids causing hazards if they can not listen. This should be a safe space for all kids and this was pretty disappointing it wasn’t handled better.\n\nThis was so fun! I have kids aged 2,5&7 and there’s was something for all of them. The toddler area kept my two year old super entertained. He had a blast. The bigger area kept my older two interested for a long time. They all want to return and really really had fun! Good pricing too, not expensive at all!"

Parents should wear socks even if you’re just going to sit at the tables bc to enter the play space beyond the lobby, you need to remove your shoes. Kids need grippy socks (available for 4.50).  It’s a shared space during birthday parties which can get busy and overwhelming.\n\nPlease remind your kids they’re not supposed to climb up the slides and not to aim air soft guns at people’s heads/faces. These are fun available attractions but are negative experiences when there are unsupervised rambunctious kids.\n\nWheezone offers snacks and drinks for purchase and asks patrons not to bring their own food in (but they’ve always let us bring our own water in). I think the menu also offers pizza, too."

          "content": "The owner told me I was going to “write a review anyways” so here I am, making him a man of his word lol\n\nUse extreme caution when booking parties here.\nWe were given misinformation from a new employee (not her fault, and we understood that)\nBut the owner instead of taking accountability kept blaming his staff instead of admitting it being a management issue. We called a week before the party to confirm we get a private room so we could do an extensive set up. The girl took our info down and said yes I’ll have the owner send some pics so you can see how to do the setup.\nOwner calls two days before the party to tell us he can’t accommodate us, gives a million excuses, blames his new staff when he should have gotten back to us well before 2 nights before our party. He made it very clear they were over booked and you could hear in his tone how stressed he was.\nNo more stressed then we were after he cancelled our party and we had 24 hours to find a replacement place.\n\nYou can tell this is a new business owner and I get how stressful that can be, but he was incredibly rude and didn’t offer solutions. It was take it or leave it! We don’t usually write reviews, but this was really just a bad experience all around.\nHoping he does better in the future when issues arise.\n\n*Reply to the owners response*\n\nFirst and foremost, your reviews appear to be mainly from one group of people, I’ll let the consensus decide if they are there based on truth or as a favor to you from friends/family. It is widely known that reviews are an important factor for businesses, and oftentimes owners will go to lengths of fabricating reviews to make their business appear to be something it is not. And I have a tiny suspicion that more honest, and real reviews will likely be coming through soon. Just a hunch!\n\nAnd yes while it is true that I did book the party 5 days before the date we wanted, something you were so adamant in saying multiple times during one conversation, somehow implying that it was our fault for planning last minute. But certainly we don’t expect someone who is not able to take account for his actions to mention or admit it. Everything I said was factual, and yet you made no comments on those facts. But you admitted your employee spoke with you and you were supposed to return my call but you failed to do so until the day before our party. Had you reached out to us in a timely manner this would have never been an issue. Attached below is the log of when we called in to go over the extensive details for our party, to which we were told to go ahead and book, to which we did, at 11pm at night as you say. And we didn’t hear from you until right before our party. Shame on you for not taking accountability. And I don’t know a professional who would offer “prayers” in this type of situation. But, it does help establish some of your character. “Take it or leave it, or I’ll offer you prayers to portray myself as victim.” We sincerely hope you do better moving forward."

The fun of this park is as a parent or grandparent you can join them in their fun. There are so many obstacle courses and challenging climbs to get to many levels. The best part of the park is its entrance fee and it’s an all day pass. The value here is incredible. I highly recommend if you’re looking for an afternoon of fun visit Whee Zone with your children or grandchildren and you won’t  be disappointed.

We chose the 10am slot in the morning, and that worked out perfectly as we had the place to ourselves. It was amazing to see the parents join the fun with their kids. Everyone who came had praised the cleanliness in the kids' area. I'm sure that some of them will come back with their kids as it's a great place for kids in South Brunswick & Franklin Park neighborhood. All the parents had a place to sit while their kids had fun. Layla (hope I got the name right)was an amazing host. Layla made sure that we focused on the guests. The food (that we ordered for the adults)was amazing as well.\nOne suggestion to the owner: we felt Layla could've used 2 more ppl (for the no. of guests that we had) to help as needed."

Soon, the playspace was bustling with at least 40 or more children (possibly due to a party being hosted). Despite the crowd, the space is very spacious and doesn’t feel crowded at all. After exploring for more than 2 hours, my kids ate better than usual.\n\nA tip for parents: bring a pair of anti-slip socks. When young kids run fast, they may fall around the corners.\n\nSome advice for the owner: consider offering a punchcard in addition to the monthly membership fee. More business options for parents are always good."

As the first indoor play area in this region, it has set a high standard for fun and entertainment for children.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Whee Zone is the unlimited play time. Unlike other indoor play locations that impose time restrictions, Whee Zone allows kids to play to their heart's content. This is a significant advantage for parents and caregivers who want to give their children ample time to explore and enjoy.\n\nThe play area itself is fantastic, offering a wide variety of activities and equipment that cater to different age groups. From climbing structures and slides to ball pits and interactive games, there is something for every child to enjoy. The environment is clean, well-maintained, and designed with safety in mind, providing peace of mind for parents.\n\nThe staff at Whee Zone are friendly and attentive, ensuring that the play area is supervised and that children are safe while having fun. They also offer water for purchase at the front desk, which is convenient. However, the only downside we experienced was the non-functional drinking water fountain. This might be due to the fact that the facility is still new, and I hope it will be operational soon to provide free water access for visitors.\n\nOverall, Whee Zone is an amazing addition to South Brunswick. It offers a fantastic play experience with the unique benefit of unlimited play time, making it a go-to destination for families. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, safe, and engaging indoor play area for their kids."

The three level structure was really cool and had great ways to climb up that were safe (there were no unexpected drops in the floor that I've seen in other indoor play parks). You go so fast in the slide in the center, I was really surprised but stopped easily and safely at the bottom from the mat on the floor.\n\nOverall, very impressed. I also like that this location is only minutes from my house. I spoke a little bit with the owner who gave me some background on Whee Zone. He was very nice and asked for any feedback we could give. Here's some feedback, we will definitely be back!"

Very cool air guns to shoot foam balls, overhead basket which can be filled with foam balls and dumped out causing a rain shower of balls that delight the kiddos.  Many areas to climb, jump, tuck away! Good visibility to caregivers below to see within the various areas.\n\nDiscount fair for the grand opening was cool too.\n\nCons: The theme fell short for me. Wild West theme with numerous images of guns blaring, cigarette smoking outlaws! There is a punching bag designed to look like beer.  An indigenous person floor standing punching bag for the kids to jump on and knock over, kick around, etc. So many children themes to choose from (animals, aquatic, cars, construction) but beer and guns. The children didn't seem to notice but I did.\n\nThis can be remedied with a few swaps for cactus, tumble weeks, art work for wagons, dessert animals. Even outlaws without cigarettes & guns."

Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me.

I cant recommend them enough.\n\nWe had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!\n\nWhen they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.\n\nIt was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.\n\nClean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.\n\nI cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!"

It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a \"bug mat\" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.\nThere was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡\nThere are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.\nWhat a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.\nWe will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children."

My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!"

Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options.

Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛"

I would recommend that socks be removed when kids climb on any of the apparatuses that have round, smooth rungs. Too much of a slipping hazard!"

          "content": "I attended a 5 year old’s birthday party with my 3 children, one of whom is 11 months old and requires a high chair. I asked the front desk if they had any high chairs, to which they told the party host it would be another $12.99 “add-on”. Considering they had already paid almost $500 to rent the space plus $200 in pizza, I didn’t want to burden them with another unreasonable fee. Literally every restaurant in the world has high chairs available for free, so charging a “rental fee” is unreasonable.\n\nThe website for We Rock The Spectrum says that you get 2 hours, but in reality you only get 1 hour of play time plus 1 hour for pizza/cake. In reality, this was a late afternoon party and most of the kids were done eating fairly quickly (or had already had lunch and weren’t hungry) and could’ve continued playing, but the staff did not hesitate to corral us into the small party room and tell the kids they wouldn’t be returning to the play area.\n\nOverall this place is very disappointing if you’re attending or hosting a birthday party."

The price is cost effective and you get your money’s worth with the amount of time you can spend and the experience for your little ones. The place is clean and often workers are walking around vacuuming which is nice to see! The sand pit is a super plus and keeps the children entertained for hours. The play structure is also engaging and inviting for the children. There is a separate space for younger children which is nice to have for the little ones. It is never overly crowded and is the perfect way to engage in play!"

Upon our most recent visit, there is now the playground police at Totsville. \"Don't touch this, don't touch that.\" If you don't want children touching something maybe don't put it at an indoor playground. An employee grabbed a toy from my toddler but did absolutely nothing when another larger child hit my 18 month old. I don't think we will be returning, no matter how clean the facility is."

It was so refreshing because you have so many adults fast to approach a child and he didn't, he approached the parent as needed and was very sweet about it. I seen another young lady vacuuming keeping the area clean for the little ones. It was really fun and we didn't want to leave. We will definitely be back💗💖 Thank you totsville."

Clean and in order. The staff was wonderful.  They were always around making sure everything was OK or if we needed anything.  The separate food / party room was well maintained and clean. The pizza that was a part of the party package was very good.\nHave your party here or just bring your children here for a great day out of playtime."

Its climbing areas are only 1 story tall so it’s easy to spot your child from the ground. They have great slides, ball pits, a giant sandbox and some really cool tubes. One thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness. The floor was spotless. The staff were courteous, there was even a coffee machine, not that we used it. They also had an area where they can climb a wall, build blocks, etc. It was crowded but not so much that he couldn’t enjoy himself and I didn’t lose track of him. They also had a bubble machine which was kind of cool to see go off every once in a while. I think we would definitely go back to this place."

The staff is constantly on the floor sanitizing, tidying, and making sure the space stays safe and welcoming. They also enforce the right rules, which helps create a fun yet orderly environment that parents can truly appreciate.\n\nWe come here regularly when it’s too hot, too cold, or raining, and it’s always a lifesaver. We also recently celebrated our child’s birthday here, and it was amazing and truly memorable.  The party was well-organized, the kids had a blast, and the staff went above and beyond to make it special.\n\nIt’s not the cheapest place, but it’s absolutely worth every penny for the peace of mind, quality experience, and happy kids. Plus, we’re always happy to support a local business that does it right.  Highly recommend!"

          "content": "Recess Play Center is an amazing indoor playground for children. Walk ins only. Booking a party on the other hand is kinda not where I would go. The reason I say this is because the standard package we book states each additional adult is $5 more. I had over 10 adults. Upon arrival at Recess, ask the attendee at the front desk. I am going to have over 10 possible kids and 10 adults as included with my set package. I specifically ask can teenage kids who are not gonna play, who are just observers. Can they be charged as an adult? I was told by the wife owner and other associate that will be fine as long as they are 15 & over. Some how three teenagers were given a payed wristband before the rest of the younger kids came. so upon the younger kids that came later, I was told to pay the full $25 fee when I specifically request to give the payed bands to the younger kids and add the additional $5 observer fee to my remaining balance. We did come up with a resolution after 15 mins of back and forth 😒Another issue I had was the size of the room. I understand that I booked that particular size but if you see that my party has grown, I would expect that they will have moved to another room as we were the only party there on Thursday evening. Most of my guests couldn't even sit down to eat. Also, didn't like we have to wait until the second hour to go in the party room that is explained on the website, but that should be changed.\n\nunfortunately they do not provide any type of food for you so come with your own food or you could pay for some snacks at the concession stand, only snacks like ice cream soda chips Do not except for some chicken, pizza, or any other hot food. LOL. Please note regardless if you not playing or just have to use the restroom. To go to the back you have to remove your shoes. Another thing is I was charger a gratuity fee (that felt mandatory) when it is not stated on the site or during the booking. SMH\n\nThats why I give it a four star. It was amazing other than the issue we had earlier. I am thankful for the amazing experience the children had and I definitely will take my kids back again, but only as a walk-in, I cannot do a party. LOL\n\nOn a good note, the entire playground was clean. It was sanitized. It was much fun. I had fun as a big kid at heart myself."

While I appreciate the clean and spacious environment, I found the pricing to be unreasonably high compared to similar play centers in the area. Given the cost, I expected a better overall experience.\n\nAdditionally, I was surprised to find that no food options were available on-site. Many play centers offer snacks, drinks, or at least a designated area for families to eat, making visits more convenient for parents and children alike. The lack of food services significantly impacted our visit, as we had to leave earlier than planned to find a suitable dining option elsewhere.\n\nI wanted to bring these concerns to your attention in hopes that you might reconsider your pricing structure and improve amenities to better serve families. I would appreciate a response regarding any steps you plan to take to address these issue. I will never go here again."

I forgot” … that was less than 5 minutes ago with low traffic coming in but okay … then proceeded on with play time.

Lastly, it will be nice if the playground games are maintained, cus some of the game are not working properly. Just a little upkeep will make this place our favorite one."

Jenn and Drew (the owners) were so amazing and helpful and FLEXIBLE with us as we navigated this day.\nThe Room: the covered tables were set up with cups, plates, and napkins. They even INCLUDED cool spidey Balloon decorations to go with our theme. We got to take the balloons home after! The room is equipped with Bluetooth so we could play music. We were allowed to bring food, drinks, and cake and Recess supplied some chips and drinks as well. Jenn came in during the party to help hand out pizza and just in general be helpful.\nThe playspace:\nOmg so we've LOVED the playspace since day one. We are frequent fliers haha. There is so much to do for the kids from bikes, to wall climbing, to exploring the playspace. There's a ball pit (the best part about that for this germ fearing nanny is that they have a ball cleaner! The balls get cleaned on a weekly basis i think). There are 6 different areas (7 if you include the wall with the...idk what to even call that. Remember that toy ((millennials I'm talking to you!)) That you put your hand on and it made the imprint and we would of course put our face in it? Yea they have a huge body size one of those!!). They have an area for your little crawlers with plenty for them to climb and explore. The playspace is big enough for me to get in and climb with my 3 year old. There are 3 slides and a section with a \"ball volcano!) They also have ball launchers in the upper area. It's a plenty big space for kids to run around. Oh they also have a cool light color wall! And you can buy snacks from honest juice to some coke products to teddy grams.\n\nI can keep singing this places praises all day! You definitely want to go here for a playdate or a birthday party!! We will.be back friday!"

It was quiet when we arrived around 10am, just a couple other kiddos and their adults, and the gal working at the front desk was one of the owners. She was welcoming and gave us a great rundown of how everything worked. The space was clean, inviting, and oh so fun. I was impressed by the wide variety of things for my enthusiastic and toddling daughter to do - from STEM activities with balls to slides to a giant Light Bright.\nIt felt safe and secure to leave our coats and shoes in the cubby. The attention to detail was impressive - like guest Crocs by the bathrooms so the gym socks stay clean, the hand sanitizer stations sprinkled throughout the building, clear signs where direction was needed.... it added up to be a very fun, engaging, positive morning.\nWe are looking forward to going back again!"

I dropped off party supplies 15 minutes before our start time and wasn’t expecting the staff to set everything up so wonderfully.  We walked in the party room when it was our time and it looked spectacular, everything was set up and ready to go!  Drew was wonderful to work with and made the whole experience so easy.  He handled everything from start to finish and went above and beyond to ensure our friends and family had a wonderful day.  This was by far the easiest, nicest party.  We’ve been to other play places that have made parents rush in, set up/decorate in 10 minutes and then clean up and rush out.  Recess does the exact opposite — they set up and clean up.  All you have to do is show up and bring any extras you want to have, they do the rest.  The entire staff was wonderful and so accommodating.  This place is clean, the staff is knowledgeable, friendly and KIND.  I cannot recommend them enough.  All our friends and family were also so impressed.  We’ll be back for birthday number five and to play on a regular basis."

The only thing I can say is 100/10 is that your guest are allowed to play as long as they want to but when I was taking my things to the back for the party host I heard one of them say “oh no she can’t keep bringing things in they won’t fit” just because they didn’t want to continue pushing carts but they demand you tip 10% I get they don’t remain in the room for privacy but you don’t get 1 designated host and they popped up maybe 5 times on me. I asked for napkins and only got 1 tiny pack. I had to keep running around to find a host, front desk had 1 Spanish speaker who was refusing to speak to my guest in Spanish which luckily I stood at the front and helped most of my guest. Also they didn’t help me set up anything besides push like 2 stands in, im grateful I had friends and family who helped. I will definitely be returning as a customer, but definitely not for parties. The employees are young and I understand but lacking respect has nothing to do with their age."

          "content": "I do not recommend this play location. The total for 3 kids was over $70, which is outrageously overpriced. Most places offer free entry for kids 2 years old and under, but here they charge even for 1-year-olds. Additionally, the worker automatically charged me for socks without asking if I brought my own. When I told her I had my own socks, she watched me take them out of my bag like a hawk, only to claim that the socks weren’t from their location because they didn’t have a logo—even though I had purchased them from the trumbull location before they started adding logos to their socks... She still made me buy new socks without any consideration.\n\nDespite my frustration, I paid the overpriced bill because my kids were excited to play. However, the experience didn’t improve. The staff micromanaged how my kids were playing and even complained when my fiancé helped our 1-year-old on the slides. It was uncomfortable and far from a pleasant outing.\n\nThis place is way too expensive, the staff are overly strict, and it doesn’t feel family-friendly at all. Save your money and go elsewhere."

You can pay for all-day access to play, and re-entry is allowed, which is a unique service not offered by nearby facilities. They also have a train available for an additional cost. The kids had a fantastic time, making the visit worthwhile, and I will definitely be returning."

So they are pushing 5 dollar socks to everyone regardless of any reason. I mean, i get if they just raised the price by 5 but of course, then people would not show up to play for 24 bucks when everyone else is 18 (with much better play areas). So we will just go ahead and sell the 50 cents sock with it for 5 and think we are smart..."

Jade replied 5, the employee said no. I would like to know why? Today my daughter was sitting in the ball pit playing and two different times she was being pelted in the face with the balls . She even said stop to one girl and nothing was done . The girl continued to follow her and hit her hard in the face until I said something . Where were her parents? Where was staff ? Second time today a boy was doing the same . My husband saw his mother, grandmother (I don’t know what she was to the boy)watch the boy hit my daughter 3 times as hard as he could in the face, not saying nothing so My husband spoke up . She went on screaming and yelling at me and my husband cuz we told the boy to stop. Long story short the person in charge his name started with a T (Truman, Terrell, Terrance) it was hard to hear inside,  took me and my husband aside while the lady continued to yell in the background. He made US leave. Not the yelling lady !!  My daughter was taking away from the fun because of what??? She did nothing wrong!! We said nothing wrong!!!\n\nSomething needs to be done about this discrimination against different people!"

(I wasn’t going to pay the extra $3 per ride) Many kids were upset - especially when others paid and went on the swing ride.\nMy suggestion - don’t charge for them OR get rid of them and install more play areas.\n\nStaff: The man working there was very kind and professional. He was able to answer all my questions.\n\nPricing: I was charged $14.95 on a Tuesday for my son to play for unlimited time. INCLUDING  leaving to get lunch and coming back again. I was not charged as the parent. Nor was my 6 month old baby. Although I did see on the website they charge $5.95 for an adult.\n\nAges: I would say the best age for this place is 1-5 year olds.

NOT ANYMORE, first of all they added extra \"entertainment\" for additional costs (rip off) the toddler area is so boring, they removed a bunch of fun things my son use to play with....a 2, 6, and 7yr old cost me $50 !!!!! For a slide and ball bit. No thanks."

Some of the equipment needs to be updated for sure, but it doesn’t put a damper on anything. There’s so much to do and it is a great workout for the parents of young children as well (since we have to be with them the whole time)!"

These cost $3 per person and the ride is only a brief couple of minutes. The rides are also pretty noisy; the moment someone pays to use it the clattering sound attracts all the other kids, who start begging or crying to ride, too. There's also a section which has a wide selection of battery operated toys such as ride-on airplanes etc. Too bad none of them had working batteries."

Bring sticky socks for the little ones for when they're not in the play area. I plan to check out the classes they offer and I would definitely reserve the space for another kid party."

There are so many activities, toys, and obstacles for the kids to enjoy and socialize. The place is so clean!\nOur daughter loves this place so much that we decided to have her second birthday party here. I am SO glad we did. The owner is the kindest, very easy to talk to, and flexible. It was the perfect space for our family, friends, and all the little kiddos! The set up was so easy since they provide all the table and chairs. And the staff member who was there during the party was kind, helpful, and attentive. Everyone keeps messaging us saying it was the best birthday bash they have been to! We had such a great experience here!"

However, a lot of the kids had taken all of the props and costumes out of the play houses and no one was collecting them so not as organized as I would’ve hoped. There was also no toilet paper in the bathroom and there were maybe a dozen ppl inside after they had been open for about 30 minutes. The biggest issue was the costume cabinets were not anchored to the wall and my toddler almost pulled one down on top of himself."

We had a great host, Jamia. She helped unload and made suggestions as we set up. It was our first time hosting outside our home so I was not sure what to expect and likely a bit indecisive about where things should go. Jamia was clearly experienced on this front and moved us along appropriately. The party room had two tables just enough for the kiddos to sit. Parents had to stand around the room because the space was limited.\nThe play area was perfect for the littles and even 7 and 8 yr olds had fun. For mid-day Saturday, the place was not packed so we had ample room to spread out and be comfortable as we kept an eye on our kids.\nI am pleased with the service and would recommend this to others. We await an east Houston location!"

          "content": "We came to this indoor playground for a party and arrived around 4:33 PM. By 4:56 PM—within just 40 minutes—our 5-month-old daughter’s gold anklet had gone missing. She hadn’t played in any of the activity areas; we had only walked in and out of the party room, so we knew it had to have been dropped somewhere along that short path.\n\nWe immediately asked staff if they could check the security cameras to see if it had been dropped or picked up. They said only the owner could access the footage, which we understood but we were hoping they’d reach out quickly in case whoever picked it up was still in the building. There was no sense of urgency. They said they’d do a sweep and “keep an eye out,” but it honestly felt like the situation was brushed off. With only one other party going on and a limited timeframe, it’s hard not to feel like this could have been handled better. If this had been a medical emergency or something more serious, we’d hope for a faster response but we’re not even sure that would’ve happened.\n\nWe’ve accepted the anklet is gone, but we’re sharing this so other families know if something goes missing, don’t expect much help in recovering it.\n\nAside from that, the overall cleanliness of the facility was poor. Toys and furniture looked heavily worn and overdue for replacement. Nothing appeared freshly wiped or sanitized, which is concerning in a space full of young kids. The party room was uncomfortably hot, and while there was a party host assigned, they weren’t very involved or helpful compared to hosts we’ve had at other indoor playgrounds. Overall, the experience felt unorganized and underwhelming.\n\nHopefully the owners take steps to improve both cleanliness and customer care moving forward."

If you’re looking for a place to have your little ones birthday this is the place! I’ve been to several birthday parties at indoor playgrounds and this was the most hands on staff I have experienced ! They will help with all of the set up for your big day from the napkins to the plates balloons and any extra decor you may need! I will definitely be coming back and have recommended this place to all of mom friends ! Owner was on sight was super informative kind and professional along with his staff. I will add that the playground smelled and looked cleaned when I walked in the building which was super important for me and my little one! Staff was cleaning and preparing everything for the parties as we walked in and were prepared to set up and helped us gather all of our equipment for the party ! If I could give you guys more than five stars I would we will remember our sons first birthday forever and it was a great experience and amazing that we didn’t have a hectic or overwhelming one thank you !"

We've been members multiple times and found it to be extremely dirty (even though it's \"closed for cleaning\" between 1-2). My mom took my kids yesterday morning when they opened at 10 a.m. and the place was completely overrun with what should have been a private birthday party and wasn't. The older kids at the birthday party were pelting balls down the slides while my two and four-year-olds were trying to play, and even after bringing it to the staff's attention, the staff only made generic announcements about \"no horseplay,\" but never did anything to stop the rowdy guests.\n\nMy mom then asked whether they could return in the afternoon. She was told that they could in theory, but Giggles was closing at 3 p.m. (Sunday, 2/16), but she could return tomorrow since it was within 24 hours. She got there with the boys today at 10 a.m. only to find out that the location is closed on Mondays.\n\nReally disappointed in this location, which has so much potential but is just not worth the price of admission - $30 for two kids and one hour of play."

It was chaos. The ladies working the desk kept coming on the lord speaker and telling parents to supervise their kids, the structure in the front was for two and under only, and no climbing on the walls of the structures. Nobody listened. I guided my kid to the less crowded areas and avoided the spots where someone had spilled juice on the floor (especially gross when shoes aren't allowed). My daughter had so much fun, but we had to leave after an hour because I just couldn't take anymore of the screaming and running. Chuck-E-Cheese isn't even this bad.\n\nManagement, if you have rules, enforce them. And fix the broken stuff. The suction machine and the ball twirler were not working."

The front desk staff had everyone leave around 12:40 to close for 1:00pm. The microphone announcer is on way to loud for such a small place. I did see them put toys back in the proper place around 12:45 but nothing sanitized . Then upon closing I seen an associate using tongs to pick up trash off the floor then picked up several toys with the same tongs. I seen a girl bleeding from a cut on her arm and nobody cleaned it up and she had on pretend clothes from the play area. Upon exiting the associates had their purses on as well as if they we leaving right after us which means no sanitation being done. Other then that my kid enjoyed the space ."

Micah walked me to the back where the party was going to be and started working!

They don’t charge for adults, only $14.99 per kid for the whole day.\nI took my son for his third birthday, and he had a blast!! They are not on top of you where you feel watched all the time, it feels great! Usually i feel awkward as an adult in kids places, but not here! I didn’t feel that there were structures where my kid would get hurt, at all! All of the floors are foam! Even if he fell, which he did, it was on foam!\nBest place in town!!\nAlso, i saw another picture saying that the ball/tube game didn’t work, but it did! I uploaded a video showing it work!!\nPlease keep this placed open for business! Your kids need it!"

They had double-booked the suite I reserved, so we were given a smaller room with an apology and a discount.\n\nWhile the setup was done quickly, and the hostess was kind, the additional hour in the playground promised in the contract was not honored.\n\nWith 45 minutes still left, announcements were made over the microphone telling “anyone not from X party” to leave, due to another private event.

All of our guests had a blast, the place overall (including bathrooms) seemed pretty clean. Apparently the place is under new management as of recently so maybe this is a new standard. We highly recommend for hosting a party, there was plenty of different types of sitting area all around for parents/chaperones, from soft sofas, small tables, and a bar height table with bar stools.\n\nSpecial shoutout to our assigned party host Natasha who was INCREDIBLE and really took our party experience to another level. From volunteering to help put up our decorations (and doing a way better job creatively placing them than we could ever LOL), to helping serve cake, cleaning up, and helping us pack away all our leftover food, supplies and gifts into the car, she really went above and beyond any expectation we had! Another coworker also willingly stepped in to help and she was equally as wonderful. Thank you for a memorable party experience!"

They gave my pizza order to the wrong family and had to re order my pizza which delayed my party significantly and all the kids were starving and when the manager told me they would not charge me for the pizzas when they gave me the bill it was on there and I had to tell them to take it off.\n\nThe only reason I am giving 2 stars and not zero is because the kids had fun regardless and that’s really all that matters.\n\nThere was one lady named Natasha that was great. I hope she continues to do well. All others were disappointing to say the least."

For instance, some of the toys could be replaced with newer ones, as a few of them had cracks that could potentially cause injury (like the plastic teeth and faucet in the clinic area). Some of the foam mats are already peeling off. Additionally, it would be great if the place could be cleaned a little more thoroughly especially the riding toys and lounge foams.\n\nOverall, this place is a gem, and with a few tweaks, it could be an even more exceptional experience for everyone."

A boy around 8 years of age running in the toddler area and nearly missed my toddler in the ball pit.  He stayed in the toddler areas. Parents were not parenting and employers were not working.  All 3 employees were sitting in the front.  They should be managing the play area as well.  Saw a kid (around 7yrs old) pull on the foam that is surrounding a metal pole and no one said a thing.  I had to tell him to let it go and go play but he was adamant on pulling it off.  The place does need some TLC and better management.  Never going back.  A waste of time and money."

The place is closed for one hour, from 1-2 for sanitizing and cleaning, however, it didn't look like anything was cleaned today. There were also toys and balls all over the place.   :(The place also lacked of ac. The unit only comes on occasionally. You would think what the charge for their birthday parties that they would put that money back in to fixing some things in the place. I do not think it was worth the drive coming here.

Reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because although the rules say you MUST wear socks, some kids/adults were wearing shoes, some people were barefoot, which I think just makes the place get dirty faster. There were also kids climbing up the slides because they didn't have socks on, which is also a rule.  Overall was a great experience."

It made the party planning process seamless being that she handled basically everything (even set up and clean up) except getting us dressed and ready! We supplied our dessert of choice while everything else was handled from the playlist to decorations to food and beverage for the children down to the goody bags (which were awesome). We were also welcomed to bring anything additional including food and beverage for the adults. With the package we selected we got to choose our own unique theme and she went above and beyond to supply the decor to go with it. I also loved how we could add on several additional things from a menu had we wanted to. Everyone had a great time and we are so happy we chose to hold our party here!"

There was also plenty of space for the adults to mingle and still be able to keep an eye on the kids, which can be hard to find in other play places we’ve been to. The owner, Caitlin, and her staff were so welcoming and helpful. They ordered and set up all the decorations based on our party theme which made everything so easy. The birthday boy and all our guests had so much fun and have been talking about the party all weekend. Sunny Day is exactly what we needed in this area and we can’t wait to come back soon!"

I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about the event.  The owners, Jesse and Caitlin, couldn't have been more accommodating.  Communication prior to the party was efficient and prompt.  They were great when I asked to bring in \"adult\" food for the mommies and daddies (instead of serving them the kid's pizza and chicken tenders) -- no problem was the response.  When I asked to bring in my own face painter and balloon artist -- no problem was the answer (they even set up a \"station\" for this!!).  When we got there, Jesse was cleaning and sanitizing the venue from a previous party -- the place was spotless when he was done!  Throughout the entire event, Jesse kept things running smoothly -- a feat when he had 25 four year old littles and approximately 35 adults partying on to celebrate our little peanut!  Sunny Day had loot bags prepared for all of our little guests so everybody left with some treats in addition to the smiles on their faces!!  Thank you Jesse and Caitlin --  this party was a huge success because of your amazing play cafe and your caring and creative hosting skills!!\nWe'll be back to visit and play soon!!  Thanks again!!!"

The booking was seamless and Caitlin kept in communication regarding theme, guest list, etc. The space is huge and I love how the adults have a space of their own for coffee/eating/talking while the kids play. There are comfy couches for parents to sit positioned perfectly throughout the play area, as well. I especially loved the section catered to the \"little\" littles! We had some guests who were not yet a year of age and they had plenty of space to crawl, sit, and play away from the big kids and the big toys. The variety of pretend play is amazing, and the equipment is top notch. My favorite part was how CLEAN Sunny Day Play Cafe is. We had previous experience at a play place in West Chester and the lack of cleanliness, itself, kept us from going back. But Sunny Day Play Cafe was so clean, even the bathrooms! Caitlin was an amazing host and literally took care of everything down to party favor bags. We will 100% be back for more fun at Sunny Day Play Cafe!"

We booked a party for our daughter, sent out invitations, by the time we came to pay for it 3 days later, they had rebooked another group. Their excuse was that “they didn’t want to bother us to let us know”. So you book people, and don’t call to confirm your current guests before you change or cancel? How unethical & unprofessional of an organization, the quality of management is truly shown.  Before they reply saying “you didn’t pay the deposit”, the date & package  was confirmed, and we were told to come pay the deposit within the week.  3 days later. Reservation gone to someone else. What a joke lol. Save your time and just do a walk-in visit to this place, but just be aware everything in this facility is subpar, dirty or broken.  Skedaddles finer years have passed sadly."

Big enough that they can play independently without getting bored, but small enough that I can sit back, relax, and supervise from a distance. Unlike other playgrounds where I have to run behind my tots and I lose them from sight at every corner.\nI also like that their music is not too loud because in other playgrounds that can really take away the focus from the kids as they play. Sometimes those playgrounds are so loud you can’t even hear your child calling for you. Not Skedaddle!\nLast but not least, the staff is super welcoming and sweet, which is one of the reasons I keep coming back."

The managers set everything up, checked in on us, and made sure we got the best experience.\n\nPlease visit the new Skedaddles!

There were two ladies working there, but they seemed more interested in chatting and gossiping with each other rather than paying attention to customers. One of their children appeared to be asleep on the couch, which added to the lack of a professional atmosphere.\n\nThe facility itself is very outdated. Most of the machines and activities are in poor condition, some were broken, others didn’t even turn on. The whole place felt quite dull, dark, and far from inviting. Cleanliness is also an issue, as everything seemed a bit worn out and not well-maintained.\n\nWhile it's not as pricey as some other places, it definitely shows in the quality. If you’re looking for a better experience, especially with a toddler, I’d recommend going across the street to Funvilla instead. You'll have a much better time there."

My white socks were black on the bottom after 10 minutes being there. The ball pit area had food crumbs all over place and the balls looked moldy. There were wet spots all over the floor. Half the toys are broken or don't work. The arcade games are always turned off or broken. There was a child from their camp that had pee soaked pants because he needed a new diaper. And he was sitting on toys and going down the slides with pee all over his pants. I even told the owner , and they did not seem to care. The place is just gross and unsanitary.  I will never be returning. And I will also be looking for a phone number to call to report them for health and safety precautions.\n\nDONT GO HERE! ITS FREAKING DISGUSTING. TRY ANY OTHER PLAY PLACE IN TOWN."

We stopped in on a whim, bought the socks which are pretty nice. The prices are fair. The place is clean. I saw people get the pizza and it's pretty big. I went with a 15 year old and 6 year old. They both had a blast. I love that they have lockers that are free, it really encourages the adults to play instead of watching their things. Also, the bathrooms have Crocs that you can slide on over the socks to run into the bathroom. It seems like a lot of well thought ideas. We will definitely come back!"

There weren’t any arcade games which I loved.  No tickets to win and cash in for some unnecessary junk. I think admission was 13.99 and you need slipper socks.  They were $2.95 so very reasonable.  It was a big indoor playground with lots of stuff for the kids to do. Perfrct for a rainy night.\n\nThe only food they sold was cheese or pepperoni pizza.  You had to buy a whole pizza.  $18 for a 16 inch cheese which was reasonable.  The pizza was also really good.\n\nIn addition to the pizzas they had a freezer of ice creams.  They also had water, juice, sodas and coffee pods.  Waters were $2 and juice was $2.50.  Thats all they had which was perfect.  They didn’t even sell candy. Prices were very reasonable!\n\nThe boys were exhausted when we left there.\n\nI will definitely go back."

I explained nicely about her and she said I don't care. so i replied please watch your kid and mind your business, the kids have been playing and the staff saw her and no one told us anything i told here the kids is sneezing coughing and most of them are sick with no mask and were eating and then play without even washing hands. Here is the problem she didn't like that we are muslims and because one of the staff was the same race and from the same country and they talked their language, the staff member came to me and asked me to leave in a very rude way. I was shocked about her attitude and being in her side because of the same race and country and i asked her for a manager or customer service number she said oh here is the number do what you want. I paid 97 $ for 4 kids for 45 min I tried reaching the corporate number but i didn't get it Please share as much as you can and try to let whoever is the manager or the owner is to know"

We left sooner than we had planned because of that. We've been to similar places in the past that had softer/quieter music or no music at all and the kids still had an amazing time. If you want to improve parent's experience, please consider lowering the music. Also, better food/coffee options would be great."

Nice temp controlled place to play during very hot/cold weather  There are separated areas for 0-2s and 2-7s, birthday party rooms, bathrooms, and a lot more. There are bar chairs, high table tops, and soft benches for adults. The staff was very kind and professional. The price includes unlimited play time.  You need to wear socks to enter (they sell them too). Looking forward to coming back!"

They even have little counter seating so you can still watch the kids play and work on a laptop or eat a meal. We will definitely be back."

My almost 2 year old likes it too and they have a nice separate area for babies, but he likes to wander to the big kid area so it’s a lot more chasing with him. Highly recommend!"

It won’t break the bank and your kids can play all day for a flat fee. All in all, much better than typical indoor playgrounds."

The only solution was if my son got hit again or the boy hit someone again he would be asked to leave. This picture is my sons face today and he’s emotional go out no because he got hit in the face. I feel like this is unacceptable and the child should be removed immediately after assaulting another child and leaving marks on their face."

Best birthday for small parties with staff being super attentive to each child's needs."

There’s so many equipment to go on that the children are non stop on the go with glee!\nThe staff is beyond friendly, caring, & super professional.  They interact and play with the children too!   The staff & owner are truly empathetic & understand the needs of our children.\nThey even make sensory glitter bottles with each child as well as part of their hands on activity.\nThe environment is safe & secure.  There is an inner gate as you enter the facility for added security to block any litte escape artist as well.\n\nCubbys are located right at the entrance to stash away lunch boxes, bags & shoes.  The kids and adults run wild in socks throughout the gym.  The experience is always a memorable one.  Another great year for us down in the books!"

          "content": "Absolutely unacceptable behavior from the manager at Sensory Beans. I’ve been attending this location for 8 years and have never been treated so poorly. During a birthday party, we were abruptly told to “go to the back” with no context, no courtesy, not even a simple please. If this is how a manager speaks to loyal customers, she seriously needs to take a lesson—or several—on how to speak to people with basic human decency, let alone how to usher guests back to a party room kindly.\n\nWhat made it worse was her smug, dismissive attitude. When I voiced my concern, her response was “I’m sorry you feel this way,” which is nothing more than condescending gaslighting. She repeatedly refused to offer any sort of real apology or take responsibility for her disrespectful tone. And to top it off, she wouldn’t even give her name. That says it all.\n\nFunny enough, the younger volunteer workers were far more professional and respectful than the actual manager. If this is how management operates now, Sensory Beans has seriously lost its way. Do better."

I showed the young girl my email and how it showed they canceled my session n code only to have her tell me that it isn't coming up on their end. I'm standing there showing her exactly what they sent me stating it was canceled with no refund n code only to have her tell me again that there is nothing she can do about it cause it isn't coming up on her end.  The young girl went to call the owner and was on the phone for a while. When she came back she said the same thing. I asked her how I could go about speaking to the owner and if she had a phone number I could call but she said she couldn't give that out then I Asked for the owners name and she wouldn't even give me that. At one point the young girl said to me \" Miss if this is gonna continue  I'm gonna have to ask you to leave\" my tone was not loud and I even apologized to her for   taking up so much of her time and she is threatening to have me leave. So disappointed, the owner should of spoken with me, this is her place of business and she should of  handled  this situation in a more professional manner.  The young girl even admitted to me that my email did show everything, the code, the cancellation  but she couldnt do anything cause it wasnt coming up on their end. I'm just flabbergasted that the owner refused to speak with me. I wasn't yelling or acting out of sorts, just trying to understand  what was going on. I will never go there again.  Ended up taking the kids to childrens social club in rockville center after and they had a blast. The owner there is a gem. Just a tip for those who plan to visit sensory beans do not follow their clock on the wall as it is 10 mins ahead. I mentioned this to them several times and it still hasn't been fixed."

          "content": "I took my 4 year old grandson there and was very pleased with the whole experience. The play equipment was clean and there was a nice variety of things to do. There was one person behind the registration counter and another person who worked in the play area trying to engage the kids in play. You do need to supervise your own child to make sure she/he plays safely, which all parents/guardians were doing. There were several slides and several swings, tunnels, small stationery ride on and bouncy toys, and a foam pit. There was also many things to climb onto or under. There was also a small play kitchen area. The bathroom was roomy and clean with a pull down diaper changing station. I do see that the entry way where the cubbies were is a small area but when I went there were only about 6 children (and 6 adults) so this was not an issue. I can see how it would be extremely crowded if it was at full capacity, especially since this is the area where one has to take off shoes and put them back on after the play sessions is over.  I am a pediatric Occupational Therapist and thought the environment was great and safe for kids with special needs however; when I went, there were not a lot of children and adults. At full capacity it might be challenging to children with sensory issues. I will say that I thought it was a fun experience for my grandson."

It is more of a place that people take their toddlers and little kids especially during the cold months to enjoy as a playground. Some of the staff are very nice but others leave much to be desired. There was one staff member that actually singled out my child for running around with another kid and made him sit in a separate room till he cooled down. Did not bother to address the fact that there were two kids running around. My son is autistic and was hyper aware of being singled out in a room full of adults and kids. Another time this same staff member put her hands on my son to \"calm him down\" and my son slapped her hand away. She proceeded to tell me to do something about it but my response is why are you touching my son when you do not even know what his special needs are and how he will react to being personally touched. Obviously my son read right through her supposed I mean well act and did not like her at all. That was the last time I went there. I do not recommend this place to anyone who has special needs kids especially ADHD, they are not very welcoming. More concerned about the babies and toddler around than providing a space with no judgement for special needs children."

          "content": "The place is cute & fun for the kids to play at. We were greeted by a girl who was interacting with my children & ready to play with them.  I will start by saying that the price is $24 per child, no matter how many children you have there’s no ‘sibling discount’ so if you have 5 children you’re paying $120 for an hour and a half, which seems super pricey to me since you’re limited on time & things to do. Next thing that I really want to hit on is that when I came in I had my mom & children ( we were the only ones there and it was already 10 mins after the time frame started). My grandma decided she wanted to stay outside to get some air with her medical service dog (clearly labeled, tags & a plus- hypoallergenic). After being outside for a little while she wanted to come in. My mom said to one of the girls working ‘is it okay if I let my mom in with her service dog I will tell her to stand right at the entry way with her so she could still see the kids playing. ‘ the girl paused &  then went to the back room to ask the other worker if it was okay. She came back out, didn’t say anything at all and after two minutes we asked her what the answer was. She said ‘unfortunately no she can’t come in with the dog because it’s not big enough and people might have allergies sorry’ ok, understandable if it was just a random dog that wasn’t a registered service dog. Ok, whatever so we just say ok you can’t deny her because she’s a service animal and she’s like ok I’ll go back and ask again , at that point it was just fine & my grandma went and sat in the car not causing a stink. So after about 2 minutes from here she said oh you can take the baby out of his car seat and go walk around by the kids if you want. I said oh no it’s okay he’s sleeping now they’re having so much fun together. She’s like oh okay. So then I was wondering, “am I supposed to be standing with all of my children playing with them?” She said “Yeah you’re supposed to be, but since it’s not that busy it’s okay.” I have never been to a play space where my children were the only ones there within my eyesight where I had to be up their butt watching them every move aside from the couple times I went to help them. So again, put off a little bit by basically being told I needed to play with them when the girl who let us in was playing with them at first I though that was the idea of the gym.\nOverall it’s a cute idea, definitely over priced for a short time &  there are a few blurred lines as to what is supposed to go on inside the gym area"

She not only yells at the parents and her staff…but she does it in front of the children. She is completely unprofessional and unhinged. It’s quite concerning. Not only that, the place is dirty. I don’t know when they clean, but it’s completely unsanitary to have children play in that type of environment. Open play time is supposed to be 90 min. Well before the 90 minutes is up; I noticed some of the staff rushing the kids to hurry up because they wanted to set certain areas back up for the next group. I saw other parents complaining as well. You would think the staff would be warm and bubbly in a place like this, especially the owner, Rachel. We will never be coming back here and for good reason.

They have a \"game\" room which seems to double as a party room in the back. My parents also came and were able to sit comfortably while watching my son play. Cost only $18 for 1.5 hours of open play. Definitely recommended for younger children, although probably too small and repetitive for older children."

I am definitely going back and I highly recommend!!"

This happened a few months ago and I planned on never sharing because I didn’t want to ruin one’s reputation, but the same thing has happened multiple times. The owner is extremely unprofessional and rude. This is NOT the attitude for this environment, especially when dealing with our babies with sensory issues. The staff here is caring and incredible, much more professional than the manager. I have witnessed the manager talk so rudely to her employees, which breaks my heart because they’re always the ones who make my son smile. I saw and witnessed her yelling at one girl for something that happened that was completely out of control. She looked like she was about to burst into tears. I have seen multiple reviews about the owners behavior specifically. It breaks my heart, but after two years of attending we will not be returning."

If you show up even a minute early, they will keep the doors locked and refuse to let you inside until it’s your appointment time. I went on a day when it was pouring outside and they had parents with infants and toddlers wait outside in the rain until it was exactly 4pm. There were no other children inside at that time so it wasn’t due to spacing or safety issues. Most indoor play spaces will let you in or allow you to wait in the waiting area if you come early. They do have a waiting area so it’s ridiculous that they won’t let you in if you’re just a few minutes early. Considering there are so many new indoor play spaces now, they should show a little kindness and courtesy towards customers if they want people to come back."

Being able to run around so free not hearing mommy or daddy or older sister or older brother saying “no!” Or “stop it!” Or “get off of that”!… Just being able to bounce around on everything  padded without resistance from anyone or anything!! he had such a great time at the party, but I decided to look into it and see how much it would cost for him to go to a session of “open mat“ to my surprise it was not expensive at all. For $17 for an hour and a half of free play, it’s actually every mother‘s best hidden secret lol it gets them super tired all that bottled up energy out… And they have so much fun here! I say that this place is actually the perfect place for ages 1 1/2 to 4 1/2-five years old… It allows them at this sensitive age to be free and explore without a mom being worried that they’re going to hurt themselves in the process. The staff is super friendly, they’re so great with the kids, even with the moms… Their mats are sprayed and Lysol’d and disinfected between every session… I highly recommend sensory beans to any mother looking to find that nice clean safe place for their child to go and enjoy yourselves… nothing is better than having a place your child always looks forward to being at and at the end of the day will help them sleep happily at night lol. Go check it out for yourself, me and my son will be there, more than likely, when you get there 😉"

I would recommend it for kids between 0-5 years old."

          "content": "I genuinely wish I did not have to write this review, because this place has such a great concept. I have visited Sensory Beans with my son on multiple occasions, however, recent interactions with the owner yesterday upset me so much that we will no longer be returning.\n\nI witnessed multiple moms being spoken to in a condescending, inappropriate way. There was absolutely zero need to treat another human being the way my friend was treated yesterday. It was quite frankly appalling, and it makes me incredibly upset that her *daughter* of all people had to witness this.\n\nIn addition to the owner's attitude, Sensory Beans does not have ample space for guest belongings/check in/departure. As a result, while attending a St. Patrick's Day event, everyone was attempting to leave at the same time when the party ended. As a mother with a toddler, I chose to stand out of the way of the cubbies to feed my child a snack by the door, along with a few other moms and their kids. There was physically no room to get our things by the cubbies due to the poor design of the space, so in order to prevent our toddlers from heading back into the play area to run around and possibly prevent clean up for the next event, we chose snack time as a distraction. We were repeatedly (unkindly) asked to move and get our things, which was physically impossible due to the lack of space.\n\nI also witnessed the owner scolding another mother of two while she was in the cubby area in the middle of strapping her daughter into her car seat. Yes, she was taking up space, but when you don't plan your business to have ample amount of space for your guests to arrive and depart, that is your own fault. This mother was not doing anything wrong, and handled the situation with so much grace.\n\nFor a place designed for kids with special needs, I'm shocked at the owners apparent disregard and lack of planning for something as universally challenging as transition times. I'm also surprised that this space doesn't have any areas where children can escape from the excessive stimulation. They could have used some inspiration from the sensory gyms in Roslyn Public Schools.\n\nI'm sad that we will no longer be attending open play sessions here, as my son really did enjoy it. The staff, aside from the owner, was always great with the children and genuinely seemed to enjoy working with the kids. Perhaps the owner should take a cue from her younger staff, who seem to understand how to interact with the public much better than she does.\n\nAs disappointing as this experience was, I am comforted by the fact that Long Island has so many indoor play places for this age group, with more on the way. Hopefully someone reading this review will take my experience into consideration when designing their own space, and learn from Sensory Beans' mistakes."

Everything was absolutely perfect, from the incredibly kind and helpful staff to the out-of-this-world cupcakes they provided. I didn’t have to stress about a single thing. Danielle and her team went above and beyond to make the day special. Highly, highly recommend for parties or play — they really outdo themselves!"

          "content": "We recently visited this children’s play café, and while the overall concept and space are very nice, there are a few things that could use some attention. The café itself is on the smaller side, and it definitely gets crowded quickly, especially during peak times.\n\nMy kids had a great time and enjoyed the different play areas, which is always the most important part. However, as a parent, I couldn’t help but notice that the space could benefit from some updates. A lot of the toys seemed worn out, and several pieces were missing. The play mats were heavily dirty and worn out, and the floors didn’t appear to be cleaned very well, which was a bit concerning.\n\nWith a little bit of TLC—like deeper cleaning, some fresh equipment, and regular maintenance—this place could be truly great. The potential is definitely there, and again, my children did enjoy themselves. I just hope the owners consider making a few improvements to enhance the experience for both kids and parents."

We had to change a 4th birthday party planned for my backyard with about 40 people last minute due to weather (48hrs!). I called Sippy Cups and they didn’t just “make it work” they went above and beyond! Danielle is super easy to work, and very generous when it came to a few little extra coffees and stuff for the parents and using her decorations.  And her team was amazing with the kids - all of which had a blast. Every parent there left saying they want their kids next party there and all the adults had a lovely time bc the kids were contained and entertained so we could actually talk!  All around it was a hit and I highly recommend!!"

Si-Si greeted us at the door and kept my daughter company while I filled out our waiver, and there were many staff members on the floor maintaining order.

The staff care deeply, everything is clean and thoughtful, and most of all, they get to know you. Your family becomes part of the community, not just another name on a list.\n\nFrom the workshops and enrichment classes to the unforgettable events like LEGO Night, the Living History Museum, and that emotional moment watching our oldest graduate from kindergarten, Imaginarium has helped us shape a learning journey full of joy, confidence, and connection."

My kiddos love the toys and the one of a kind play equipment that is provided. We’ve gone to almost every event they have hosted. We go to the Open Play which the kids love and so do I, because on occasion I’ll bring work to get done. The kids stay entertained the entire time we are there! We’ve had a birthday party there, which was hands down incredible. We’ve done the Kids Night Out events, we love that we can trust the staff and our kids feel safe. Recently, we did Meet & Greet with Santa and I don’t think we’ll ever go anywhere else to see Santa again. It was affordable, enjoyable, and above all expectations. We are so lucky to have this incredible business in our community!"

The teachers are amazing, the other family's are welcoming and Lenae, the owner,  puts on so many different activities for the kids so they don't feel like they are losing out on what traditional school offers. They have classroom learning, structured gym, free play, holiday parties, school pictures, workshops and even dances plus more.\n\nWe even had a family emergency last year and Lenae worked with us to ensure my kids didn't lose their place after taking off \"school\" for over 2 months. This place was such a blessing to find. I would highly recommend checking them out."

The owner provides ample opportunities for the children of our community from play, tutoring, birthday parties, and a complete homeschool enrichment program.\n\nI have been present for clean up time between open play and homeschool classes and I have been present for after hours clean up. The team does a great job and cares about your children’s time there to be in a clean environment. The team worked together to get a good sanitize down before the next group of kids came in and end of day clean up is always a good deep clean.\n\nLast thing to point out is the pirates cove! My kids love the art supplies provided, the crafts available and all the items in the shop up front.\n\nOverall cannot say enough about the Imaginarium! The place has become a staple in my children’s (and my own!) lives 💗"

Kids are able to express themselves and make friends, while they also get to play on different structures and equipment. Also, the facility is SUPER clean for being a children’s playground, the staff even goes around every so often (I’d say every 10 minutes) to wipe all toys and play structures down after children play with them. The bathrooms have CLEAN changing tables, and the snack area has complimentary tea and coffee! Love it!!\nDid I mention the staff is very attentive and helpful? They will assure everyone is safe.\nThey have a few different play structures with different surprises inside each one, kitchen, dinos, trains, and more. There is even air hockey, building blocks, and crafts for the older kiddos to do if they tag along. I just can’t wait to watch Imaginarium grow and see what other cool stuff they have to offer in the future. This place is awesome!!! 10/10 Recommend!"

I'm able to relax because I know they are playing in a safe place. It's not filled with loud bounce houses and music like a couple of the other indoor playgrounds we have visited within the state. They do sometimes have music playing, but families don't have to shout over it to be heard.\n\nThe staff are friendly folk, it's affordable, you can bring food in and sit in the seating area (sans peanut products), its not overstimulating, and it's just a gem of a place to have local to us in SOMD."

The toys were NOT clean at all, the wall decor and houses were covered in thick dust like they hadn't been cleaned since they opened, the equipment was covered in months worth of dirty handprints. At one point, my daughter was playing in the blue foam blocks and picked up a huge ball of hair. Disgusting. I get that children aren't always the cleanest little people, but for that reason they should have a daily cleaning crew. Clearly they do NOT. Secondly,  the rules state socks must be worn... but kids were barefoot. I get it's summer but kids are climbing all over the place... where sweaty feet are. Finally, there needs to be an age/height limit. There were huge kids like 6-7 yos running around, rough-housing, putting the littles at risk of getting run over and hurt. I thought this place was exclusively for younger children ( < 5) but I guess not. I really wanted to like this place because it has great potential.  It is a great idea and has a lil lounge and store... but I cannot get fast how gross it was. I should have taken more pictures but I was too busy making sure my daughter wouldn't get run over by the big kids. :/ Sadly, I won't be taking my kiddo back."

Throughout our time here, I have leaned on this place to help my kiddo grow in a safe and imaginative environment and I have never been disappointed. The play structures are incredibly intricate and promote imagination that I know many kids are losing sight off with the new age of electronics. I love the staff here. They are sincerely caring, helpful, and attentive. There is not much for kids to do in this area and this place has been an addition that enhances the community tremendously. The prices are also phenomenal. While the cost of everything is on the rise, the pricing here has been consistent without sacrificing value. I also love that the owner will utilize and promote other products of small businesses! Thank y’all for everything you have done for my family and we will miss this place when we leave."

The owner is very passionate and personable and will go above and beyond to ensure everyone has a good time. There are frequently age appropriate events and the staff very deliberately cultivates each one to ensure the highest quality possible. A must-go location if you are in southern Maryland and have kids."

Also a great place to have your child's birthday party; my son really enjoyed his last year. Thank you Imaginarium for bringing this much needed service to SOMD! :)"

Even during the pandemic, once they opened back up, we continued to come.\nThey were constantly cleaning the play areas and toys and I remember they had breaks between open play to sanitize everything.\nGlad this place is here. Not much to do around here for kids indoors so this is amazing. I think pricing is fair in my opinion. Worth the 3 hours of open play!"

          "content": "I really wanted to love this place, but it was underwhelming. IMO the price is a little too steep for what you get.\n\nThe play structures are super cool. I loved the art section and the reading nook, but there’s so much unrealized potential.\n\nThere are little toys scattered throughout like legos, train sets, magna tiles, and play food, but it’s such a mess. We couldn’t play with some of them because they were missing pieces, or didn’t seem to actually go together. I get it, tons of kids come every day, but there are so many organizational options that could be used to actually encourage play and imagination, like the name says.\n\nThe art section was super cute, but again, underwhelming. The only things available were construction paper, a few random crayons and colored pencils, dried out markers with mixed tops, scissors, and chalk. There are so many ways to make this more exciting and organized. Especially since we paid to play here.\n\nThe reading nook is a great concept, but it’s right next to the giant castle/ship structure, so it doesn’t really lend itself to reading. There was a cool, giant bear, but that got put away because someone used it as a landing pad for the slide. The books seemed pretty random and old. Everything in this place could be so much more!\n\nI was also disappointed in kid behavior. I know there’s not much employees may be able to do, but it’s dangerous. Kids throwing things and roughhousing on top of two-story structures shouldn’t be acceptable when people are paying money to play here.\n\nIn all honesty, I feel like I just took my kids to an indoor playground and paid $22 for it. I don’t think it’s worth it. It could be in the future, but it’s not right now."
