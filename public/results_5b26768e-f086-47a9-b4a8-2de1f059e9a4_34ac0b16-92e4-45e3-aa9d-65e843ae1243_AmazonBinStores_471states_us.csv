First 2 times were great. Found some great values and spent a couple hundred both times. Was well worth it. I pull up this time to find only 3 cars outside, on a Saturday nonetheless. Soon as I walk in I see why... be warned, this is no longer a bin store, regardless of the sign out front or the name posted in Google maps. This is a store. Nothing you'll find here is a great bargain or exciting find. It's all overpriced low end mediocre unnecessary stuff.\nTo the owner of the store. Was it worth it, changing from a packed out bin store with every customer happy pushing full carts to the register to now a deserted small scale family dollar? It's sad to see your customers fade to a disappointed walk of shame as they turn around to leave without making even 1 purchase isnt it? Why? Because you noticed that some stuff people were buying for $8 sells new at Walmart for $30. Guess what, that's why we would come here and not Walmart. Greed pushes people away just like it dos with happiness and joy. Sometimes the truth is Harsh and we don't want to hear it. However I'm one of those disappointed customers that you wanted to make as much as you possibly could instead of us both winning. You don't want the customer winning. That's why I won't be back. i like places that bless me as I bless them. You know, where we all rise instead of using people as stepping stones.

This was my first time at this store. I went on a Friday because the deals are better. I was not greeted when I walked through the door, which is fine. I know some places of business may not speak or they might be focused on something else. I bought an adjustable garment rack and a child's scooter. I got home to assemble them and I was missing screws for the garment rack and the handlebar for the scooter (LOL). I assumed everything was in the box because it was sealed (with tape, I should look more closely). I went back the next day to see if I can find the missing pieces, but I was unable to locate them. The employee stated I should have opened the boxes before I left. I had no idea I could do this because there are signs that state \""Do not open boxes\"".  The employee was nice when I went back, but I was still disappointed. I bought two items I cannot use.

I don‚Äôt know who own this business but if you read this take it as a learning lesson, I came as a first time customer!  and I saw a pair of earbuds that I was interested in on the first entrance table I was trying to open the box to verify both earbuds was in the package immediately someone came to me and it was a security guard, he told me you know you not supposed to open that right! I said ok! Then he proceeded to tell me that he will get fired if the owner saw that he did not say anything to me when I open it  that‚Äôs why he had to approach me and tell me that. Ok I would have left  that alone and left no review and keep it moving. However another customer after me saw the same earbuds he proceeded to open it and even connect to his phone so he can verify it‚Äôs working i told the lady that was at check out about it and she just told me they  can‚Äôt keep their eyes on everybody and that‚Äôs she sorry, so I told her why the security guard was telling me I should of not open the box when this customer not only open the box but took the earbuds out and connected them to his phone and try them out? She said our eyes can‚Äôt be everywhere. So this cashier which I believe is the owner, yelled at the customer  that open the package and test it on his phone  while he was doing it in front of her and me , in Spanish language and told him he can‚Äôt do that. she assume I don‚Äôt understand  or speak Spanish and I speak it and understand it perfectly  I‚Äôm black so they assume I don‚Äôt know Spanish, they hired a black security guard so he can harass black customers cause they only interested in Spanish speaking customers.

I'm on a very limited income, so yard sales, thrift stores and $1 day at Bargain Bins, is where I normally go to purchase needed items. Sure, you have to be ready to dig through items, plan to be there awhile and mentally prepared to handle other shoppers. Some may think I'm joking or crazy(but it doesn't matter to me bc it's the truth) when I say this but I depend on Jesus to provide what is needed. I pray and praise Him for every single thing, little or big! For example, my charger cord to my Chromebook broke. I can't afford to do online shopping and order a new one. Along with a vitamin supplement I needed, that had to be ordered, as well. So yesterday, I prayed and asked the Lord to show me favor and provide everything, I'm in need of at Bargain Bins. Of course, He did. Plus more. Along with things on my list, I wasn't expecting to get at Bargain Bins. I use to go to the one in Arab and Huntsville before they closed down. Majority of the time, the owners or employees were always rude. This is not the case with this store. Not once, have I ever had a bad experience with this store. ALL employees are pleasant, talkative, relatable and helpful. Of course, I praise and worship Jesus for all things first but this store is the vessel, He used to provide for me.

Large selection of low end products. Ive often seen broken glass, sharp or pointed metals in the Bins. Customer and staff safety must come before profit.\nThe staff spend  more time communicating between themselves than with customers. The savings really don't justify the poor customer service, the trash and filth left in the bins.\nNot worth the crowd, filth, snooty childish employees, and lack of quality products.\n*********** UPDATE ************\nIts just OKAY. Manager said they now send the best items to their auction site. It's great to know as a customer of the local store that the best and most expensive items are shipped off and not available to be bought at the largest discount. What was once a nice place is no longer really worth the hassle.  I've never seen a retail store with such rude employees. The manager seems lost and can't reel in his employees. Why does he tolerate one of his floor employees wearing head phones while working on the sales floor? That employee reacts like she is terribly bothered when asked a question.  Very poor attitude like most of the employees. For a long time I was able to find great bargains for items that I could use. Now the items being sold are lower cost items and the Friday 10am to 3:00pm price of 13$ is ridiculous.  The merchandise appears to be rejects from other bin stores.\nBetween the bad merchandise and the terrible employees it's hard to justify spending time there going through the disorganized mess. Watch out for the broken glass and sharp items found in most bins.\nAVOID AT ALL COST UNLESS YOU LIKE TO PURCHASE DAMAGED ITEMS OR ITEMS MISSING PARTS.

Nothing wrong with that, I like deals. They do have good deals in there just be careful what you buy. I'll change it to a five-star review if they ever offer returns on merchandise that do not work.

The only down side is they don't stop or limit the resellers. These people will come in right at open, grab multiple shopping carts, and throw everything that appears to have value into the carts. They do this for every tub and then sit down and figure out what they don't want and throw it back. This almost certainly means the tubs are picked over with only junk left most of the time. I have gotten a few good things at times, but as an example, this last time we went there was a husband and wife couple that had 6 Xmas tress in their cart and 3 more carts in tow full over everything that was still in boxes.

Items were haphazardly strewn about, with no discernible system for organization. Not only were they not separated, but many were in pieces, rendering them virtually unusable without significant effort on the customer's part.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the pricing structure was confounding. While ostensibly promoting affordability, the store required customers to pay multiple dollars more for the same item, often without clear justification for the price discrepancy.\n\nNavigating through the chaos, I attempted to locate a specific item, only to find myself frustrated by the lack of coherent signage or helpful staff members. In the end, I left Bin Store empty-handed and thoroughly dissatisfied with the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Bin Store falls short of meeting even the most basic expectations for a retail establishment.

Immediately, I was told by an aggressive employee to stop because that was against their rules. 90% of the boxes in bins are torn open. I stopped and apologized and said I didn't realize that was a rule. No biggie. But this is where it went south. After explaining that it was my first time that I wasn't aware of the rule, he proceeded to get aggressive and tell me that's no excuse and that if I went to Walmart they wouldn't let me open boxes, which is false. I told him I understood and he could move along. He continued to tell me I was wrong. We had already established that, and it should have been over. At this point, I'm getting angry, and told him, I got it and to leave me alone. He then asked me to leave. Very poor customer relations for that particular employee cost them a customer.

Like Fridays, most things (at least those on the tables) are $12, and Sunday's they are $7. Thursday the are closed for restocking. It does take patience to look through everything as most things are piled on the tables and have to dig through. It can be worth it when you find something you want or need. Depending on  the time and day, it can take quite a bit of time just to look through the stuff on the tables as they are people in front of you googling multiple items to determine their value. If something is boxed and you want to look at it, all you have to do is take it to one of the tables they have set up in the back. Here, you can open and leave items you have decided you don't want.

We found several things that we wanted to purchase and saw the sign on the wall that said Fridays $8.00 so proceeded to Cash Only lane to make our purchase.  My 6 items rang up as $77.00.  When I questioned the amount, the clerk said that it was 6 items for $12.00 per item.  I told her that the sign said Fridays $8.00.  She said the price is $8.00 per item after 3:00pm, but before 3:00pm, the price is $12.00 per item.  I pointed out the signs on the store window and on the wall that said Fridays, $8.00.  She said the signs were wrong and needed to be taken down but she is not tall enough to take them down.  She insisted the price per item is $12.00 on Fridays before 3:00pm and said it even says this on the website.  We told her we were not on the website.  We were in the store and were looking at the signs on the wall.  She said well the signs were wrong and she was firm on the price per item.  We left our items at the counter.\n\nThis was the second time that I have had problems in that store.  A week ago, they had celsius water for $2.00 for a 12 pack.  Someone had opened a package and there were only 7 drinks in the bin.  I put the 7 drinks in my cart and took them to the register.  The lady behind me had a 12 pack of the drinks that were still packaged.  The clerk told me since I only had 7 drinks, I had to pay $2.00 per can for a total of $14.00 but the lady behind me only had to pay $2.00 for her 12 cans because they were still in the package.

The lack of respect from this individuals is starting to annoy me. It‚Äôs almost as if they have an issue with anybody trying to be there first. As it get close to time to open about 15 people show up to get in front. I understand you have someone saving your spot but you try to save 2 spots and no matter how you do it troje lesve chairs or even bags holding their spot. But they feel entitled to remove your items saving your spot even when thry know who is trying to save the spot . I find it rude and even though they know they move your things they act as if they know nothing.\n\nI appreciate this venue for its versatile approach. You can either arrive early and queue up, a practice I personally avoid by reaching there just before opening. After a brief two-minute wait for the line to clear, you can proceed inside. Given the diverse preferences of individuals, perceived value varies, making it a haven for everyone. Though occasionally there are assertive individuals, I prefer to focus on my own matters and not let them affect me.\n\nI've come to realize that leisurely browsing through the bins yields better results than a hurried approach. Fears of missing out are unwarranted, as you're likely to stumble upon items of genuine utility. On dollar day, a fervor for clothing items ensues, yet with patience, you may find that many initial grabs are eventually discarded, revealing hidden treasures.\n\nBe prepared for the presence of baby strollers and occasionally impolite children. As for their $50 boxes, I strongly advise against purchasing them ‚Äì they prove quite disappointing. The value isn't commensurate with the expense, making the dollar day a wiser choice. In sum, if you're on the hunt for a worthwhile bargain, this establishment is a definite go-to.

I have been to one other one and this one was a hard pass. First the store is not bright nor inviting. Second they had music that wasn't my taste, but that's not a deal breaker. I walked in and see a bin with a set price of $25 and then there's a bin for $8. The $25 bin had some decent items, but not enough for me remember. The $8 bin table only had a six pack of wet wipes. I looked into the bins to maybe find something at the price of today $6. I saw some items that might have been worth $6 like a pet heating pad that looked like it was still sealed in box. It was really a hodge podge of items. Then there's the wall of items still in boxes and not in boxes. There was a dog bed like a Coolaroo that was labeled with the price of $30. That was a big turn off. Other items looked like they were practically retail price. Of course there's all sales final and no returns. I left empty handed and don't think I'll go unless it's dollar day or more discounted.

Has also gone down A LOT in the last 8 months. Here‚Äôs my biggest concerns and why I went from spending $350+/wk to not shopping here anymore.\n\nFridays need to be more organized and much safer. The system should allow everyone to participate, with people standing near bins and a clear countdown so everyone has a chance to be rewarded. This would encourage more people to attend on Fridays, instead of the same 30-60 regulars who camp out overnight and can have +1‚Äôs join them right before opening. Some of these regulars are even staff members, which creates an unfair advantage and favoritism for prime spots.\n\nThe current practice of lining up 100+ people at the same time poses a huge safety risk, which is why a lot of people I‚Äôve spoken to avoid Fridays. 3 unarmed security guards will NOT help this situation, and as the store grows the bigger the risk becomes.\n\nInstead, if people were scattered around and the process was more streamlined, it would not only reduce safety hazards but also help attract more consistent, diverse crowds, and discourage overnight camping. It‚Äôs a win-win in terms of safety, fairness, and customer retention. Greed will be the end of this store, fixing it sooner than later would be bring in much higher margins. Maybe the first 10 people wouldn‚Äôt spend as much but the other 90 people would spend triple to quadruple.\n\nThis is constructive criticism & my review will be updated in 6 months.""},{""reviewer"":""Debbie Meece"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""Love this place.

This was the best 99. The owner was friendly and always gave great prices. It was clean, well organized with a friendly staff. He then passed it to his nephew while he went to run his bigger store in rialto (anyone know the exact location?). The nephew kept it for like a year and sold it. The new owner upped the prices by at least a half on some stuff. It got new paint job, a soda machine and thrifty's icecream. Nice upgrade forsure! I'd give it 5 stars if it wernt for the feeling of being overcharged. I got 10 worth of things and ended up getting charged 14. How did I get 4 dollars of taxes...who knows. The original owner would wait till your done shopping and even throw in something for free or for 50 cents if you were a regular. The new owner will rush you at 8:50 when they close at 9:00.Normal treatment but definately has big shoes to fit & not as good service  as before. Anyways i've bought lots of stuff here and never had anything not last. The paint and craft supplies are even better than the name brand craft store competitors.

It's not good when you think you've come across something great, only to find its pieces are missing and probably strewn across all the tables in the store.  I wish the rules would be better enforced.  The have no problem opening a box for you, to see and decide if you want to purchase.  If not, it can be taped shut and even a brief description written on the carton for the next person.  It's discouraging and boring when just a couple days in, there are so many meaningless empty boxes, pieces, and parts to sort through.  You may find a useful object on Saturday (the highest price day) and have to decide if it's worth paying for then, or risk coming back another day (like Friday, the lowest price day) and hope it's still there.""},{""reviewer"":""Yayo Onate"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""8 months ago"",""content"":""Thank you kindly. \nYou are appreciated""},{""reviewer"":""Jody"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""8 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""frank savino"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""8 months ago"",""content"":""It's a mess but  if you like rooting through to find treasures this is the place""},{""reviewer"":""Rick Sinclair"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""9 months ago"",""content"":""Owners are absolutely insane""},{""reviewer"":""jaime calvo"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""10 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Alba Enriquez"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Janei L"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""Really great deals and excellent customer service!""},{""reviewer"":""Stormy Blains"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Super helpful and friendly!

I normally go on Saturdays for their $15 items in the bins. However, I recently went in on a weekday and saw multiple $15 items that I saw on Saturday that were now set aside in the \""50% off the original price\"" section. For example, I saw a floor lamp that was in the $15 item bin on Saturday, now removed from the bins and set aside for $40. It feels icky. They're constantly changing prices on items so they can make more money, but if they keep doing this, they will lose customers.

What started as a routine shopping trip turned into an unpleasant and humiliating experience.\n\nThe Incident\n\nMy partner and I were browsing the store during their \""$1 Everything\"" sale. We had over 10 items in our cart when I picked up an already-opened box containing a beehive ice tray to show my partner. This seemingly innocent action led to a series of confrontations with staff.\n\nStaff Confrontation\n\nAn older employee approached, telling me not to open boxes. I explained it was already open.\nA younger staff member then accused me of opening and discarding the box, which I denied.\nThey compared their store policy to Walmart's, questioning if I'd open boxes there.\nPerceived Discrimination\n\nWhat troubled me most was the feeling of being singled out. Other customers were opening boxes and mishandling items without reprimand. When I pointed this out, the staff dismissed my concerns about discrimination.\n\nPublic Humiliation\n\nThe confrontation escalated to the point where we were being yelled at in front of other customers. This public dressing down was embarrassing and, frankly, traumatizing.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nDue to the severity of this experience, I'm considering seeking legal advice. No customer should be treated this way, especially when no wrongdoing has occurred.\n\nI strongly advise potential shoppers to be cautious when visiting this establishment. The aggressive approach to customer service and apparent selective enforcement of rules make for an unwelcoming shopping environment.""},{""reviewer"":""Crystal Steppan"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""No opening package ok fine I agree, I take item to buy it along with other items I picked up with price clearly marked.

The store sells returns and overstocks from other retailers like Amazon and Target.\n\nI have shopped this kind of discount store before and for me it is hit and miss depending on what they have in that day. Here they have the bins in the middle of the store. What you pay depends on the day of the week, Friday's $12, Saturday's $10, Sundays $8. By the time you get to Wednesday everything in the bins is $4. They restock on Thursday evenings. I stopped in on a Friday afternoon so the bins had the best selection but they were also the most expensive.\n\nIn addition to the bins they have other items around the perimeter of the room at set prices, up to 90 percent off retail. I saw clothing, a lot of perfume, household items, holiday decorations, and small appliances. The friendly staff was at the ready to open any boxes I wanted to see and plug in the appliances to verify they worked. I saw a Le Creuset stock pot for only $29.\n\nThey had a lot of house hold goods like dishes, sheets, blankets, pillows, and decorations. If you are setting up a new home and aren't picky then this would be an inexpensive way to do so. If you are set on a specific brand you may find yourself out of luck.

I thought I got a g8 deal only to see the multiple boxes of food bought had expired. Also check the Amazon website closely to compare. They break apart sets of items that are meant to be together. Example, Amazon showed  7 dollars for a set of ten items. They broke the set up and scattered the items through the store so even on  dollar day, it becomes 10 dollars ( instead of $7) for those ten items. Even if you show them the set was clearly separated they dont seem to care. Retaping, we watched as one worker retaped a box without putting the pieces sitting next to it back in. Dont buy a box or bag unless u look inside to know for sure its not damaged or used beyond repair. The g8 deal of $4 for a waterbottle ended up having a hole on the bottom.  These are returns. Just wait in the loooonnnggg line for them to open for you. Inspect closely.  Clothing pieces are separated. Amazon will show as a matching set ( top with bottoms or socks that should be in a 3pack) but they try to sell separate at 9, 6, 4 dollars a piece. Its cheaper buying on Amazon direct as a set.""},{""reviewer"":""Justine Garcia"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""Awesome staff !!!""},{""reviewer"":""Vicky Opel"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""Really fun place to find good deals, things for your home, crafts, clothes, books and alot of amazon treasures!

I don't like deceptive business practices, to be clear you will NEVER buy an iPad or any named tech for like 10$ from here. They have pics of Samsung's and air pods and that's just not the case at all, not even in their way too expensive for old big lots items section.\nThis bin store is still....fun. it CAN be a good deal. There are two sections, The outer edge of stuff where they claim the items are marked down is straight up old big lots items and stuff they didn't sell claimed to be marked down a crazy %... it's mostly full price retail with extra numbers. The bins in the center are fast and loose however you will receive an item about that price. It's normally a bunch of low tier items or bulk foods, those are the winners.\nThe pics of technology are just false advertising they do not carry those items and do not sell them at a discount. It's to entice you but it's straight up fake. The highest level of tech they had was a shark boat you could got for 10 at the dollar store, I would've paid 6. Yes it's a good deal but you'll never find like they are trying to pitch you.\nThis store is a cool concept and fun idea, to have the business owners pump pictures of things you can't buy like it's a deal is annoying and makes your company look deceptive, and dishonest.""},{""reviewer"":""Roxanne Kane"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""It‚Äôs random but you can find great deals.

We entered on Saturday at about 3pm in the afternoon. There is such a calm atmosphere in the place.\nThis store is massive and bins were nearly empty when we arrived. Could tell folks hit this place hard this Saturday morning!\nWe were still able to score several nice items nometheless. All the items in bins are the daily price listed on the sign. Then on the sidelines there are several items labeled 'overstock items' that are priced individually or by case.\nThere are very few carts but they do have plenty of Ikea shopping bags & amazon boxes that can be used. (Boxes cost $1).\nThe thing we liked most about this bin store compared to all the others is that 1. Most of the item boxes are open or say what is inside. (No need to waste time running over to a specified area to have them opened up.) 2. Overstock items always have a sample product on display. 3. Customer service is great. 4. There is a sitting area up front for the folks who want to relax and wait rather than shop.\nThe gentleman running the store (John) was very helpful and let us know the best times to visit in the future. We will definitely be returning!\nToday, despite the place being bare, we still  purchased shelf decor, a couple of neat toys for our kids, vitamins, shipping poly bags for our business.\nThere is plenty of parking and at the entrance there is a bin of free face masks.\n\nHere is the intel received from staff :\n*** Friday is THE day to go..  Arrive just before 9am on Friday for brand new items.\n\nThe owner rolls out 5 more big bins of items at 12pm (high noon) and then again at 5pm.  ***\nSat am - 9 am -5 new bins are brought out.\n\nBins stores are first-come first-serve... find ya some sweet deals.

Unfortunately I will not be going anymore.  I bought new bike helmets for my girls, and after I bought them I looked them up online to find out they were recalled for safety.  These helmets were federally recalled because if someone falls wearing them and hits their head they will not protect them from injury.  So, I went back to Value Bins and spoke to the lady - owner- in which I told her it is against the law to sell recalled items- it is a federal law which holds not only liability but fines.  I told her I didn‚Äôt want a refund I just wanted store credit and she said sorry we don‚Äôt do that.  In which again I told her they broke a federal law selling the item to begin with.  Moral of story: they are not want you think they portray to be- be careful what you buy especially baby‚Äôs items, and food.  Some foods were dated 2020!  They know what they are selling and they don‚Äôt care!  I will not be spending anymore of my hard earned money there and sadly they truly think they are above the law.""},{""reviewer"":""Hanane Tmart"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""Good hunt for some returned Amazon items !""},{""reviewer"":""Angela Dobson"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited 3 years ago"",""content"":""This is a combo Bin Store and Pound store..

They buy up pallets of Amazon returns and overstock from Target, Walmart and Kohl's and then they sell the items in their stores. The sell a little bit of everything from linens, fragrance, appliances, home decor, candy, toys, and clothing. They could possibly have anything you can order from Amazon.\n\nThis Hotbins recently opened in Sunrise in a former Salvation Army store. Depending on the day you visit affects the price you pay. The store is closed on Thursday. On Friday it is full of freshly stocked merchandise for $12. On Saturday the price drops to $10. Sunday $8 and so on. By Wednesday what is left is $2. They also have some kitchen appliances that are priced at a discount. All sales are final so buyer beware.\n\nThis was my first time in a Hotbins so I took me a little while to get up to speed. I was confused because a lot of the items didn't look they were worth $10 they were charging that day. I saw books, a box of tissues, and other random cheap items. I asked an employee why they were charging $10 for a box of tissues and she explained that those items would sell on the $2 day. So you have a mish mash of items at all price points and it is up to you to discern if you think it is worth the price they are charging that day. On the Saturday night I visited I was hard pressed to find anything I wanted to purchase that I thought was worth $10 even though the salesperson assured me almost everything in the bins was worth more. One other important thing to note is that many of the items are in brown boxes. Most likely these are the more expensive items. You are not allowed to open the boxes. You have to take them to a corner of the store where an employee will open the box for you. It is very frustrating to look at a box and have no idea what is in it and have to go through a process to open it. No thanks.\n\nI was not impressed with Hotbins on this visit but the next time I have a Friday off I may give them another chance. According to an employee people line up early before the store opens to be the first to get the fresh merchandise. If it is too crowded it doesn't sound like it would be enjoyable. Also according to employee Hotbins has giving out phones and possibly a laptop in a raffle on Fridays as an incentive for coming in. If you like a treasure hunt this may be a store for you to try but I left empty handed.""},{""reviewer"":""Isela Valdivia"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""10 months ago"",""content"":""This place used to be really good, but it's changed lately.\n\nWhen I first heard about this discount store, I thought it was great. The concept of the store is to offer returns and overstock items from other stores (mostly Amazon, but also including Target and other big name stores) at an incredible price. Each item is $12 starting on Fridays, and the price is periodically reduced as the days of the week go by until it reaches $2 on Wednesdays. A few months ago, you could still find plenty of items, but now there is less and less merchandise available for Wednesday customers. It even seems like they are sorting through the merchandise in the warehouse to price it higher. So, no matter what day of the week you visit the store, there will be plenty of items that will cost you more than $12.\nI often visit this place on Wednesdays when everything is supposed to be marked down to $2, but for the past 2 months or so there has been a very low amount of merchandise available in their bins (tables) regardless of what time of day I go to the store. It wasn't like this before, during the morning and even during the afternoon there were just too many items to choose from. I don't know if they are saving the merchandise for the \""most expensive\"" days, are selecting everything to sell at the best possible price (over $12)... or they just don't have any good merchandise to sell on Wednesdays anymore... I don't know what happened.\n\nI really hope I can find many, many good items for only $2 again.""},{""reviewer"":""Mohamed Abu dhaim"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""Great Deals ,Hot Bins One Of The most Unique bin Stores In State of Florida, the concept is great and very affordable for everyone in the community their biggest day is friday 12$ any item and then the prices keep dropping\nSaturday 10$\nSunday 8$\nMonday 6$\nTuesday 4$\nWednesday 2$\nAnd they close Thursday to clean the store and restock the bins with new merchandise for the big day FRIDAY .\nMY ADVISE DONT HESITATE TO VIST THEM AND JUDGE THEM FROM ONE VISIT YOU HAVE TO TRY ALL DAYS AND THEN U WILL SEE HOW GREAT THIS STORE üëçüëç""},{""reviewer"":""Michael Sindiong"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""My nephew told me about Hotbins, and he described it as a store where alot of Amazon returns are being bought and resold.

It's pretty cool. The best days seems to be the first 2 to 3 days after restocking. You can find some really good deals. They even unbox them for you so you can see before you buy. Alot of things are in boxes taped shut with little to no clue what's in them. I noticed on $2 day, they take away some good products that didn't sell during the days prior because I could clearly see the familiar bins with the products I had just seen a day or 2 before, way in the back blocked off with the new merch for the following restocking cycle.  Assuming they don't want to lose money on $2 day but that seems unfair for customers.  If you're going to be scavenger hunting for more than 30 mins or so, be prepared to be able to handle the warmth of 82.8 degree. They turn the AC up, assuming to save money? Even the cashiers are equipment with a fan at full blast.

He told me $20 dollars.  So he forsed the open peice back into place and said it's fixed.  So a little upset , I was still going to purchase it for $20 dollars.   It dosen't matter if it cost $500.  New or used.  A deal is a deal. So now he wanted to open it to see if it had batteries in it and I told him it did because I tried it out at the service station.  So no he said \""since it has batteries in them , I have to charge you $50 dollars because I'll loose money \"". I explained to him that the box says there are supposed to be 2 extra batteries aside from the 2 inside the walkies.  It shows it on the box.  He said \"" it doesn't matter,  I have to sell it for $50 dollars \"".  I found that so unperfetional.   Don't let his mellow and nice talking fool you.  He won't do the rite thing as a business.   I was thinking of buying furniture there this coming month and now I'm totally not going to do that.  I rather pay more money than to deal with customer service like this.  It's not worth it to me. I encourage people not to shop here.  Maybe other places like this one is more personal and fair. But I don't like dealing with managers (owner) like this.  I will take my money elsewhere.\nWon't recommend, mention or take anyone here no more.""},{""reviewer"":""maryann cherfere"",""rating"":""2/5"",""date"":""5 months ago"",""content"":""I was in there with my little girl, she needed to use the bathroom, and she was not allowed to use the bathroom, she was almost in tears, trying to hold it,\nYou should have restrooms available for paying customers.""},{""reviewer"":""Bonnie Almada"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Has discount merchandise for different days of the week $2 up $12 each day is different.

The premise of a bin store is that every week they get rid of all old product and restock with new for the next week. However you can tell that they just repeatedly put out these unmarked boxes every week so their store always looks full and they don't need to purchase as much new merchandise every week.

Glass items shatter to pieces and the fragments are left there. Management doesn't do anything about this as far as I know.\n\nMy husband and I love going to bin stores. Black Fridays is set up like most bin stores are, it's not particularly unique. I am not complaining about the nature of the bin store, I am complaining about the way this one is ran. Have we found good stuff? ...Yes. But if you have to go, do it early in the week before everything is scattered and destroyed, wear GLOVES AND A MASK, and keep a close eye on your things.""},{""reviewer"":""Sandi Warren"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""This store is unique.

Shopping here is not for the faint-hearted but for the dedicated bargain hunters who love the thrill of the hunt. The price point is staggeringly low, with everything on offer for just $1 every Wednesday, and 3 to 6 dollars on other days.\nWhile it's true that a significant portion of the store's inventory can be categorized as low-end or unwanted items, the real allure lies in the occasional valuable finds tucked away amidst the clutter. Patience and a keen eye can sometimes reward you with a surprisingly good purchase, though this happens rather infrequently.\nThe store's name, Black Friday, captures the spirit of its pricing strategy, but don't expect the kind of quality or brand offerings associated with the post-Thanksgiving sales madness. It's more akin to a perpetual yard sale with an ever-changing assortment of goods.\nIn all, if you approach the Black Friday store with the right mindset, it can turn your shopping experience into an exciting treasure hunt. For bargain hunters who enjoy the thrill of searching through the rough to find the diamond, this store offers a unique, if somewhat unpredictable, shopping adventure.""},{""reviewer"":""T Cook"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited 4 years ago"",""content"":""Bin shopping.

After the visit, I waned to take the family out for some shoping when we notice this store. Always looking deal and never seeing this store before, we decided to check it out.\nUpon entering my wife immediately wanted to leave. Large bins of disorganized stuff spread out on their sales floor. We both like to thrift store shop so I convinced her to stay and check it out. After being in the store for 10-15min, what I can only guess was an employee started yelling about how if he caught anyone stealing they would have a bad day. Clearly a threat, as he stood at the front do with 4 other gentlemen. Laughing this off we continue to look around. After finding a couple of things we decided to check out and continue our day somewhere else. This same loud gentlemen with his lil kids back pack on started yelling at a customer for maybe looking at him wrong? Acting big and bad with his 4 other so called employee's? Still trying to not let this bother our day. When trying to leave I was surprised to find one of the employee's blocking the door and was there to let us out. I was even more surprised to find out that they had locked the front door while customers where in the store shopping. This is clearly fire code violations, and quite possibly other violations of safety for customers. The so called employee's, felt more like a want to be gang. Dressed in street clothes, acting like low class thugs. I will be reaching out to the local authorities about the experience. Would not recommend anyone shop here.

This one is the absolute most poorly run. This speaks to the owner. They want to try and run one of these places with minimal employees. That's not how these places are run well. They want to get greedy and charge wrong prices on wrong days and change it all thebtime. You need an employees or 2 to walk the floor and make sure no one is opening packages. They also act as security to remind people to watch their kids. There should be reminders repeatedly. Dont open packages. If you do, you will be escorted out. Have a rule, no strollers allowed. This is where many people are stealing. There are no employees to check people as they leave so they get away with it. Keep the food items out. The packages get opened and there are food crumbs all over the clothing and other items. People are opening packages and spreading out the contents. Have a table to the side where an employee opens the package for the shopper and then re-tapes it shut. Better managed bin stores have this. The reason this place is a hot mess is that the owner or investment group or whomever is in charge doesn't know what they are doing. Go to Overstock in Lake Elsinore California which is run really well. Spend money on a staff to run the place. Having one or two teenagers at the registers is not enough. Allowing craft kits and costumes and party supplies to be opened and tossed about is senseless. Allowing people with a bunch of kids who are running around and eating and spilling on the things you want to sell is bad business. I predict this place will go out of business and they will blame theft or the economy or rent but it is their own fault for trying to save a nickel on wages and losing thousands in sales. Your customers are your bread and butter, treat them as such. Your employees are making you money, hire an adequate amount.

You can find great deals here. Friday is 16.00 per item. Saturday 9.00 per item.  Sunday 6.00 per item Monday 4.00 per item Tuesday 2.00 per item,  Wednesday is 1.00 day.  Food is half price daily.  There are clothes as well which I have never purchased,  but they have a special in the clothes as well.  You can get really nice brand new items.  For the bad part... Everything is in bins, which once everyone goes through the bins items get opened and items come up missing and Everything is non refundable non return as well,  so if your paying 16.00 a item and you get an item missing parts or broken you have wasted 16.00 just items adds up very quick to 32 dollars so multiple items can get expensive if you don't be careful.  It's a loss to you and to me them as well because if bins were more closely monitored, I feel the process could have a lot less breakage and sell more products. There are about 20 tables, which means it can get quite messy in the bins. They honestly would have to hire more people to properly try to monitor things better. Overall, I have gotten some really good deals on items while finishing my basement. Such as Led lights,  bathroom vanity lights with holders, shower shelves,  ceiling fans, cameras, knives, driveway lights, and 6 ft extension cord.

You can find me stalking their Facebook for updates!""},{""reviewer"":""jake white"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""Besides the blatant gouging with the price increase this store is always a hassle to shop at. It's overflowing with decent stuff but it's just wildly disorganized and has a general feel of griminess. The worst part is there is always only a single person checking out at the register and a line of around 50 people no matter the day or time. Plan your trips when it's likely that no one is there or else you'll spend more time in line than you did shopping.""},{""reviewer"":""Chris Ellis"",""rating"":""2/5"",""date"":""4 years ago"",""content"":""I was really excited about his place.

Philips hue Light bulbs, rifle scope, speakers, Xbox controller etc\n\nOut of the 36 items I bought 14 were electronics. Of the 14, 10 were defective.\n\nThe clothing I bought was ripped.

They allow people to open up boxes at the bin which in turn results in theft and missing pieces to items that were previously all together in one box. Everything is just thrown about. I hope the owners eventually go the \""Hot Bins\"" route and have their customers open boxes only with an associate and if the customer doesn't want it, they seal the box up and put back in the bin. There were so many empty boxes there it was very disappointing.

The store was almost empty and the packages were ripped off and damaged. I would not recommend to go on that day of the week. Although I bought three things you are basically buying blind. On the other hand, at the end of the store, you could see all the packages that they were going to put on sale on Friday, and although the boxes look very big and attractive, when you get closer to see the detail, they are discarded products, in poor condition, or old. For example, 2024 calendars. I know that on social networks they post pictures of people with iPads, laptops, etc, but judging by what I could see, it seems more a question of winning the lottery than finding good or cheap prices regularly. Unless you are in the area, I don't recommend making even a 20-minute drive to visit the store at all. A very disappointing Check the pics of what I bought. I hope this helps.\n\nUpdate after Hotbins answer: The way the store looked like had nothing to do with store concept. It's about offering good quality products in good condition at all times. I went during Wednesday morning and the store was a mess. I do not suggest going on Wednesdays. I don't know if the quality is different on other days. Maybe the experience is different. Not sure. If you allow me the suggestion, Hotbins should offer an organized and tidy experience every day. Some products at 2 bucks, in the way they were displayed, were too expensive. Some of them looked disgusting. There are other stores that offer all their products at 1.25 and they look great. I understand that sometimes people behave in an inappropriate way, but you can always do things to make the products look better. I hope it helps you offer a better experience.""},{""reviewer"":""Mike Glogowski"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""1st time going to Hot Bins and didn‚Äôt disappoint, the big mistake was not being there before they opened the doors, I saw people that were there and they had some really good finds.\nA friend and I got there a little after 9 and we spent 3 hours there and we boy bought about the same amount, I can definitely see why people go there to and spend a lot time there, go home sell everything they bought and then they go back.

If you do not want it, they will tape it back shut and re-bin it.\n-Yes, some items are missing pieces.  For this you can thank either thank Amazon, the original person who returned this item (possibly because it was missing pieces), or the ding dong who was trying to rip the box open in the bin to see what it was and pieces fell out.\n-These items, for the most part ARE RETURNS to Amazon.  Amazon typically doesn't resell the returns back from the web store (they do sometimes). Instead, they pile up the returned products on pallets and sell the pallets wholesale to independent distributors.  Hence, stores like Hot Bins appear.......  TAH-DAH!\n- Yes, they occasionally will get \""high end\"" items.  Let's be real.  These folks are running a business.  Would you sell a BOSE speaker on a Wednesday for two dollars?  Would you sell a hoverboard for ten dollars?  If you said yes to either of those, you probably should stick to NOT owning a business.\nIn conclusion, I hope I helped put things in better perspective and understanding for anyone unfamiliar with the Bin Store Concept.  Also, I hoped to not have offended anyone (it's REALLY easy to do these days). I do recommend wearing latex gloves as ALOT of people are touching everything in those bins.

LEGAL GUIDELINES ON PRODUCT AUTHENTICITY ARE NOT MET: I asked to open a box that said Paper Shredding Machine and it had a protector inside to cover a mattress and perhaps other items, because the box was large and heavy.\n\n. NEGATIVE AND NOTHING RELATING PURCHASING EXPERIENCE: The person entitled owner of the place approached us in a very abrupt and unfriendly manner, DENYING part of the service that this type of store should offer, saying that the employee could not open all the selected boxes, even though the store had FEW customers.\n\n. DIFFERENTIATED AND DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT: The first thing the owner asks me is if I spoke English, perhaps associated with the treatment he would provide.\nThere are signs in the store asking customers not to open the boxes, but there are none that say that you have to buy the products without opening them. I was able to observe that they have an area, when paying, where the employees opened the boxes for other customers.  Apparently they select who not to open the boxes.\n\n. LIMITED CONSUMER PROTECTION AND IN OUR CASE NULL: The titled owner of the place called me to buy and pay for the merchandise, without the boxes being opened, he stated that if the boxes had the name of the product on the outside it was enough, because from opening and closing them so much, they would break; For him, it is less important to preserve consumer rights. This being the case, the purchase cannot be assured, in terms of distinguishing and evaluating whether the products were damaged or incomplete, it would not even be possible to see what is being purchased, since some boxes did not identify the contents. This goes against consumer protection laws.\n\n. VIOLATION OF CONSUMER RIGHTS: The owner of the establishment denied me the right that every consumer has, to look at and choose the product, or products, that they are going to buy.\n\nSo, seeing so many violations: usurped rights, bad treatment, the unfair trade system, where I was limited to evaluating what I would buy and the quality of it, I abandoned the entire selection of products and left the place.\n\nObviously something is wrong in this store, I have taken some time reading other users' experiences, finding opinions that literally state that this place is a scam.""},{""reviewer"":""Rebecca Borrero"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""9 months ago"",""content"":""Went on a Saturday, I think we expected more, but should go on a different day.

But the $10 Friday is wonderful - I love the previews from their Facebook so I can get what I want and leave  as there are a lot of people there.

One thing I have never liked from this Location is that they seem to wait until people are so tired of sifting through junk to bring out new products which seems counter productive.. now the last three times I have been here I have purposely wasted over an hour waiting until 11 a.m which is when they claim new items will be brought out to replenish the bins only for the 11 o‚Äôclock hour to come and go without any new items being brought out. Meanwhile, they are constantly announcing that new items will be put out at X hour trying to entice people to stay only to turn around at the specified time and say nothing is being brought out which is a deliberate lie and I find disrespectful towards your customers time because I spent the last hour having my time wasted with their deceptions. it‚Äôs now 11:18 AM and when I asked about the new items that were supposed to be brought out 20 minutes ago the guy looks around then says no we‚Äôre not doing it now, again Deceptive, very deceptive actually and shady to do while you‚Äôve just spent the last two hours announcing the items are going to be brought out at 11 o‚Äôclock. needless to say I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be coming here for a while especially when you, consider that there are several other places in the area, now to do the same at and that they don‚Äôt hoard items or lie to the customers to keep them around because as the items are dwindling down, they continue to put out more product, unlike the treasure bins location""},{""reviewer"":""Glory Hosana"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""My first experience here and really enjoyed it!!""},{""reviewer"":""Lakiesha Jennings"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""Helpful staff, and fun to shop through.

It is a smaller bin store but it doesn't disappoint! The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Unlike others, they hang most clothing or place it in its own bin which is much more convenient. I appreciate that they have stations to test items but also have a bin for items you do not want next to it for them to then return to the main bins. I would like to recommend maybe a small trash can or something at these stations because you do have to occasionally remove plastic or random packaging to actually see an item.\n\nMy only complaint isnt anything with the store or its staff its actually with the general public shopping there. We have been going here for a long time and in recent months people have gotten so bad about unboxing things and scattering pieces throughout the bins. By lunch time on Saturday the bins have become a mess with all the items that have been opened and tossed throughout. I cant tell you how many times we have grabbed a box just to find it had been opened and now parts of the item in it are missing or scattered throughout the bin. We find parts of some items in complete different bins often when they were originally together. The staff and owners are doing as much as they can to try to stop this but the public has become so disrespectful. Recently, they started blocking off the restroom to deter people from using it because they have had so many people vandalize the restrooms by smearing feces and other unsanitary things everywhere. They are trying to keep the store clean and organized but there is only so much they can do.""},{""reviewer"":""William Baker (Jesse)"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""amanda davis"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Janice Austin"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""Awesome place to shop for deals.""},{""reviewer"":""Katy Dansereau"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""Absolutely love this store!

The day you visit is up to you; Restock Friday and Saturday ($6 item days)have the best items and they go fast.""},{""reviewer"":""INFP me"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""10 months ago"",""content"":""Just learned that the store was here- not in North Augusta.\nDaughter and I have made two trips to check it out.\nThe  first day, a day they had put out stuff - when we discovered it was there- and everything was $6- and second trip, dollar day- to see the differences.\nBecause we arrived late on 'put out' day, I can't speak to how busy it was early on this day, but I can say it was steady when we were there.\nThe bins were plentiful and there seemed to be a good variety of items.\nWe had them open a couple of things for us and were happy with most of what they opened on that day.\nOn Dollar day, we went earlier, it was much busier and had far fewer items. Many items were already opened- which did make it easier to know if you wanted it or not.\nThere wasn't nearly the variety or the range of items, but BOY, if you NEED or want a phone case- of ANY sort- I'd recommend coming here - and on this day- because I've never seen more of them in one spot üòÜ JS\nWe didn't have any problems finding more than what we counted on.\nThose who work here are very friendly and helpful. They told us about the place and some of the treasures that they occasionally get in- They were happy to open the boxes for us, too, which I appreciated- because if they had been reticent, it would have felt like I was asking too much, and I would likely not bother to pick up items I wasn't certain about.\nIt is uncomfortable to be in a position where you have to ask for assistance and the assistance isn't readily given. It was here- and that earned bonus points for the introvert in me! üòè\nMy Daughter, very much a grown adult, said she felt like other customers were more pushy on dollar day. She said that there were those who literally snatched things from her hand. I can't say that happened to me.\nMaybe it's because I had the cart, or I'm older, or maybe someone wasn't paying attention when they did that - I have no idea. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nThere were plenty of bargains but none worth being ugly for üòÜ - Not even on $6 day- I'm afraid-\nBut hey, maybe that's just me. It just doesn't seem that serious, right?\n\nSummary: Nifty lil store, will have to come back in the middle of a cycle to see a comparison in crowd and items, see how it matches with first and last days- to be fair.\nBargains to be had. Mostly random items. It is understood that they get all new and random things in every week. What we saw this week, it may be totally different the week after. üòÜ\nThings we saw this week included: Lots of phone cases, party decor, pillow case pairs, paper items like stickers and calendars, odd and end baby toy & trinket, filters of all sorts and shapes, socks, candles, coffee cup (single), school random items like pencils or dividers or clear tabs or elastics, some hair items, some food items (in small bulk- close to expiry), lots of panels for yard signs or wall decor (? some seasonal, some just decorative), and pet outfits/costumes.\nPictures posted are of the place and not the people.

A worker announced the rules over a bullhorn, with the one  rule that stood out being that you must be 16 years old to participate. We both found this age requirement unreasonable as most people can see and are aware of what they're about to touch inside the bin.

All the junk and trash leftover from the previous week stays in the bins, trash and items all over the floor, making it a pain to try and navigate a shopping cart, employees that seem to be more interested digging through the next weeks products then enforcing any kind of order/organization, empty packaging left in the bins from people stealing the items inside, unattended kids wreaking havoc because their parents aren't paying any attention to them. Items that contain multiple parts, like lego kits that had multiple bags inside, were separated so they could charge for each individual part. I've found multiple items that cost less brand new from the actual retailers that originally sold them. I'll admit, I have found some items that were worth the value. But those items are so few and far between that it doesn't make up for what you have to deal with while shopping. And if you do find anything good, you have to buy it right then even if the price of the day is above retail for that item... because if you wait and try to come back on a cheaper day, the item will be gone.

I want to start by pointing out that if you plan to go, you must prepare to dig through boxes, blankets, pillows, lamps, rugs, dishes, plastic bins etc. You name it, you‚Äôll find it! Also, plan on being there for a while cause it‚Äôs a free for all and you have to have time to find the real treasure but also because the line to pay can get really long but rightfully so as so many people are purchasing many items at once. They have clothing to kitchen tables and so much more! Everything is new and priced to sell! They‚Äôve also made some very good changes to the store adding perfumes and clothing and shoe racks which helps keeps stuff more organized than before.\nRemember, every day is a different price per item. If you have Facebook, you should definitely follow them because they announce all of the stuff they have daily by doing a live video and posting pictures so you‚Äôll be able to get a glimpse of what they have left every day.\nFinally, I wanna mention the staff because they are truly great!

This also ensures bins remain organized and merchandise is secured inside the boxes for our convenience, unlike other stores in which items have been found scattered and damaged. On Fridays for only $10 are filled with items you would normally pay top dollar for. I‚Äôve purchased a Ps5 controller, air fryer, huge lego sets, Stanley tumblers, name brand tools and so much more. Be sure not to miss the dollar days on Wednesdays. You will surely find items well worth over $1. I have purchased large seasonal outdoor inflatables that are retailed over $50, an inflatable bed, refrigerator and pantry organizers, cabinet organizers, party supplies and so much more for just $1.

This restock entails the store to close for 15 mins in the afternoon while they restock the bins with bigger and expensive items. With the store closed while they restock bins, these family members are standing first in line at the door outside (along with everyone else in line hoping to get some good items) looking through the glass inside to see what bins they put the restock items in. As soon as they reopen the doors these family members and kids all run in the store and grab all the restock items, so you don‚Äôt have a chance of getting good items.

I‚Äôm the third winner today. In the box, there are so many great and useful items, including clothes, bags, kitchen stuff, a vacuum, a blender, side loaders, a shaver, an aromatherapy diffuser, a cervical memory foam pillow, car parts, electronic stuff, a kiddie pool, and more. Thank you so much, Wild Bins!\n\nAnyway, my husband and I have come to shop at Wild Bins many times, visiting the $12, $3, and $1 bins. We always hope to find valuable, useful, and inexpensive items that are better than buying them online or elsewhere. Every time we come here, it‚Äôs really fun and gets your adrenaline pumping! The staff are super friendly, helpful, and I love the energy they put into their work. The place is really clean. Shopping here saves us a lot of money on items for our household and personal use. For example, I got a really nice keyboard for $1, headphones for $12 that are worth over $170 online, a vacuum for $12, medical supplies for $1-$3, and a car stereo and parts for $12.""},{""reviewer"":""Ruben Villamizar"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 weeks ago"",""content"":""Very good""},{""reviewer"":""Hayat Baydoun"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Obinwanne Orji"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""Staff are respectful and always willing to help.""},{""reviewer"":""Sonia Ali"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Marion Akins"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""The entire staff was pleasant and very helpful the store was organized and clean.

You never know what you will find and that is part of the fun!   During my last visit I got a $90 Fold 4 case with pen NEW for $10.  Also got a $170 bluetooth speaker for $10.  Definitely worth a visit and it is a fun time digging through the stuff finding deals!\n\nUpdate 10/3/24:  After visiting a ton of bin stores throughout the state, Wild Bins has been the most consistent in quality and service than any others.   Here are three reasons that Wild Bins is better than most other bin stores imo:\n\n1.  They don't allow people to rip open boxes.  You can take a box to the counter to be opened, inspected, and resealed. This insures that all items remain intact for the next interested buyer.  Once an item has been opened and resealed they will write the contents on the box or tape an amazon print out of the item.  Stores that don't maintain this rule just end up having bins full of random parts of ripped opened items that are worthless.\n\n2.  Good vibes.  The friendly staff are always monitoring the store and making sure everyone is civil and following the rules.   If they see you opening a box, you will be politely called out and warned.  If you have questions, they are always happy to help.  They will even show you how to scan barcodes to identify items.   There is always a nice vibe in the store and they play good music.\n\n3.  They consistently restock.  Wild Bins puts out more stock than any other bin store I have been to in Michigan.  They have pallets lined up at all times at the back of the store ready to drop.   It is always a real treasure hunt and I never know what to expect.\n\nFrom the friendly staff to the great deals, this is a great local business that I am proud to support.""},{""reviewer"":""Cheryl Bell"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Paula"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""Edited a month ago"",""content"":""Friendly staff - need a better way to see what in the unopened boxes - and mistry boxes need to have better items.

But sometimes when I go in there, people cut in front of each other, people opened up packages, they're not supposed to and the staff can't catch everyone. So it's not the staff's fault at all.

Apparently, her kids took something and instead of dealing with her, the staff turned to us and tried to make me pay for what someone else‚Äôs kids stole.\n\nThey told us we couldn‚Äôt leave until we paid and said we were never welcome back.

You can find some good deals but most of the really good stuff are hidden and saved for family members and people of the same ethnic background. I used to go every week until I noticed a trend from the workers at cash. Not only are they inconsistent on who they charge what but they rude but they are extremely racist if you are not from a specific nationality. The girls at the cash accuse literally everyone of lying and or trying to steal. No customer service, but rather stare downs and looking for a reason to accuse someone of cheating the system. For example, you have a pack of something that is sold as a pack of 8 but someone has separated the packs, because on $25 day it was a pack of 8 but on the dollar days you want to charge per item. If it‚Äôs in a pack and 8, they want you to pay for 8 individual items on the cheaper days which is wrong and defeats the point and concept of the system. They also have a blocker on your phones so you cannot use it in the store to check on the net for the pack sizes and prices of things. I see MANY people from the same nationality getting away with free stuff and filling garbage bags with items and the girls at the front don‚Äôt count every item and they charge them differently than anyone else from another nationality.

There are bargains on any day of the week.

Even on $1.25 day (Wednesday) I find smaller bargains like pillows, sheets, dolls, toys, bath rugs, $25 shower curtains etc.). No matter what day I go, I can find a bargain, but I GET THERE WHEN THE DOORS OPEN AT 10am.  And the clothes are such a deal, whether for my grandkids or heavy warm clothes to donate.  Recently Noah (owner) and Rhonda (Parma manager) donated many, many useable unsold items on the last day before restock day to a nonprofit I support called Humble Designs. This nonprofit furnishes homes for families who have been homeless, and Humble Designs was beyond grateful for the items donated. Though I usually go to the larger Parma store, I have also found treasures at the store in Kent.

I had been watching their Facebook for months and even asking questions about certain items and which location was busiest on certain days to plan my trip. I chose Johnstown because they had a few items that interested me that were going to be in the bins on the $7 Friday. When I arrived at 9:36am, there was a line, which is fine and I expected it. What I didn‚Äôt expect was the rudeness by grown adults as people searched through the bins. I‚Äôd almost get to the bottom of a bin just to have someone throw items on top of my hands and arms! After dealing with that and searching most of the bins, I decided to check out the shelf items. I was so excited when I found a diaper genie my pregnant sister had been asking for. It was $11 cheaper than any store. To me, it appeared unopened and brand new. When I got home, I decided to check every item. What I found was that the cool mist humidifier from the bin I was excited to find was missing pieces and even had water spots and mold like it had been used several times. It was missing the two most important parts for it to function also. So that went into the dumpster. I also found that my ‚Äúbrand new, unopened‚Äù diaper genie was missing the refill it was supposed to come with. Good thing I bought some.

There are great bargains to be had on a huge assortment of items for home, office, pets, health, etc.  I have scored items that I had only hoped to get for fabulous prices from lighting, stoneware, workout equipment, small appliances, and more!  The staff are very friendly and welcoming here and I have continuously been amazed by their phenomenal customer service when I'm in the store. The odds of you leaving empty handed are slim and none and you will be happier for it.  Make sure you check their hours because they are not open every day of the week. Bins are re-filled Fridays starting at $7. and the daily discounts go down from there, but do not miss the shelf items which receive markdowns by color coding.  There is an area designated for opening \""mysterious boxes or packages\"" from the bins.  Do not open stuff over, around, or in the bins while you are shopping. It makes for a messy business for the staff later and for future shopping. You can even plug things in at the check table to make sure that electric heating throw works or those USB lights work.\n\nIt's FUN to shop here. Worth the trip to Johnstown.

Lately, it has become clear that we are being unfairly targeted, seemingly because of our loyalty. Perhaps someone feels we‚Äôre finding items that others can‚Äôt, but the truth is, success in a bin store comes down to time, effort, and experience. Whether we‚Äôre first or last in line, it all depends on how much time we spend searching, how well we keep our eyes open, and whether we recognize value when we see it. There‚Äôs absolutely no way of knowing what you‚Äôll find‚Äîit‚Äôs all chance.\n\nYet, for some reason, complaints are being made‚Äîwhether from upper management or employees‚Äîthat paint loyal customers as if we‚Äôre receiving special privileges. That is completely false. Many of us travel 20, 30, even 60 miles just to shop here. We stand in line with 75 to 100 other people, with no guarantee of finding anything better than anyone else. Some days we walk out with great finds; other days, we find nothing at all but still make purchases.\n\nLoyal customers have gone out of their way to support this store. We‚Äôve picked up fallen items, removed glass and knives from bins to prevent injuries, and even helped new customers learn how the process works. To hear that loyal customers are now being treated unfairly is both disappointing and frustrating. For example, we‚Äôve been overlooked when selecting people for the line, as if that somehow affects what we find. This is a bin store‚Äîit‚Äôs not Target, it‚Äôs not Walmart. It‚Äôs every man for himself, but with respect. No one snatches items from someone‚Äôs hands, and no one expects to be punished just for occasionally finding good items.\n\nI hesitated to say anything or leave a negative review, but it‚Äôs truly disheartening to see a business turn against its most dedicated customers. We have always been kind, respectful, and fair. We‚Äôve never asked for special treatment or favors‚Äîwe‚Äôve simply supported your business. And yet, we are now being watched, targeted, and treated unfairly for reasons no one understands.\n\nDo better.

Was there yesterday and had to update.\nTo upper management; please go back to higher price/better stuff. I talked to some of the regular customers that frequent the store. I‚Äôd suggest higher prices with better merch. The people you‚Äôre attracting now are trouble. They‚Äôre willing to fight over JUNK. We know a lot of its knock offs, but I think it‚Äôs going to turn into a bad situation.\n\nWhen they first opened they had good stuff and it was a lot of fun. Over time, it‚Äôs gone downhill. Seems like there‚Äôs more ‚Äústuff‚Äù but every week is the same items. If you need a stuffed animal for menstrual cramps or Christmas ornaments, go on quarter day. I hope they go back to the way it was.\nEdit: after their remodel- store looks better but the quality of the merchandise has dropped off significantly! Mostly junk! Made my last visit for a while today. I originally gave them 2 stars but now it‚Äôs 1. Don‚Äôt waste your time. I‚Äôll stick to Macbids!\nEdit #2: it‚Äôs been almost 6 months since my first edit and I decided to do another. My wife and I decided to go today, Sunday February 11th. Wasn‚Äôt expecting much because it‚Äôs two days after restock but was pleasantly surprised! Hidden in a bin I found a brand new pair of gen3 Apple AirPods! For $7! So I decided I might start updating every time I go, just on Friday. Good experience, I‚Äôll add a star, bad experience, remove one. I noticed a comment on their Facebook page that said ‚Äúthe more we buy, the better the product will be‚Äù I disagree. The better the products, the more I‚Äôll buy. So it‚Äôs a management decision, do you want people to spend $$ in your store on Friday and get good reviews, or not? I added a star today subject to change on Friday.\nFebruary 16th - disappointing.\nFebruary 23 - same people (regulars) get the few decent items again. Talked to a couple of the other regulars and they‚Äôre getting tired of wasting Friday mornings.\nMarch 1 - Didn‚Äôt go because; I work. Just from their FB post it looked a little better, but they could be showing the few good things they had. Still doesn‚Äôt look worth my time.\nMarch 8 - it was a little better, not much, but a little. Same people in the front of the line got most of the good stuff.\nMarch 22 - honestly, I‚Äôd like to thank Management, purchasing, the owners, whoever was involved in the decision to only put a couple good items out every week. My wife and I would literally spend $400 every week in this store! On this Friday I didn‚Äôt buy one thing! The things I picked up to look at were all broken. Happy to say I‚Äôm giving up my Where Ya Bin habit! I have a feeling they‚Äôll close soon and maybe relocate to another NEO area..\nUPDATE: First time back on Friday in 2 months!

I'd like to purchase items here, I'm not being paid to go through your bins to check which boxes someone else opened. I follow the rules of not opening boxes, but I'm not about to do work of sifting through the bins and taking opened boxes to the counter. Such a weird request. If they want to stop this from happening, I would over staff for a week and have workers standing at the bins. Then catch people opening and kick them out. Don't punish your customers who follow the rules.\n\nAlso, if you use the Amazon bar code scanner, fair warning often it doesn't work and has given me the indication I was buying something other than what came up. It's really a gamble if you don't take everything to be checked before purchase. Make sure you have a few hours to spare! Below are a couple of things I found.

Along with what I imagine are regular store items (CDs, DVDs and VHS) there were freeze dried Skittles done locally. If I know I am going there in advance I may call and try to order Milk Duds ad Circus Peanuts. But I found.a VHS with the perfect title to describe a friend. If she doesn't still have a VHS player the box alone is worth the $;50. Plus I found a few other things. Nice parking. If you like yard sales with pleasant people and are dreading the winter season, now you have a place to shop!""},{""reviewer"":""Christie Storie"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""A lot of nice items for very low cost!""},{""reviewer"":""Gwendolyn Starkey"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""I live right by it I love it""},{""reviewer"":""Todd Koonce"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""The ‚Äòbin‚Äô part of this business is minimal- older items now""},{""reviewer"":""Rhonda Harbaugh"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""This is not even close to being a bin store so should not be listed as one.""},{""reviewer"":""A w"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 years ago"",""content"":""What a great hidden treasure in mount Vernon.

The store smelled like weed when i first walked in and when i had circled the back of the store looking at the clothes i saw the man puff on a vape (saw and smelled the vapor) while messing with a box. I browsed for a bit before deciding on the coat and went to the completely unmanned register. I stood there for quite while, as he kept messing with the box in the back, and to be honest wasnt sure if he worked there or was a patron checking if all the parts were in the box. I kept looking around and didnt see any staff so i left the coat on the counter with a small note on the coat saying i wanted to buy the coat but if it was him then his box and vape were more important than my sale. After i did this and headed towards the door he finally perked up and asked me if i was ready to check out. I simply said yes, i was, and just left.\n\nSeconds after i got in my vehicle i saw him chasing after me from the store. Being from the inner city, i knew nothing good would come from that and drove off. Sure enough he pointed at me, i saw him yelling something, rip my note and give me the finger.\n\nGood lord i am not supporting any business acting that.""},{""reviewer"":""Melissa Shepherd"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""6 months ago"",""content"":""Nice friendly staff.

We just stepped foot in the store and a guy got on the loud speaker saying they were closed and to come back tomorrow. 1st, the store is not that big and there was literally no one there except us, so I dont know why they even have a loud speaker. He could have just said it in a normal voice from where he was and I would have heard him so that was a joke. However, what sent this lack of professionalism over the edge was they literally had someone come to the front of the store and get us out. This person didnt greet us or anything, as a matter of fact they didn't say anything to us at all. They just wanted to get us out. Now I understand when a store closes that you don't want someone to come in last minute to shop because workers want to go home. I've worked retail before so I get that but my wife and I had never been to this store and didn't know when they closed or that it even was 8 o'clock. My point is that it was very poorly handled but if they would have just done things a little differently (respectfully) they probably would have gained 2 new customers, instead they lost 2 customers because these kinds of places are a dime a dozen so there are a lot of better ones to choose from.""},{""reviewer"":""Chicho"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""My favorite place""},{""reviewer"":""John Smith"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""This store is great and by far the best in town.

She would assume me and a few customers where opening boxes in the red bins. She made a few customers leave including me. Before that there was another girl who used to work here I believe her name was bree, when you asked her for help she'd shrug her shoulders not helping me at all. One employee that I do miss that I don't see anymore is kato and also her son moe. My favorite employee would have been Wednesday she would always have a positive attitude and always offered to help. I hope this review reaches out so I can be able to come back more often without being accused and ignored and maybe they won't lose many customers. I remember this place being jamm packed with customers.

I asked the female employee, ‚ÄúSo is it everything we can fit in a plastic bin for $10?‚Äù The woman nodded but then a male (bald, maybe 40s) said, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs whatever is in our black bins.‚Äù They were wooden planter crates.

However, while the deals are tempting, it‚Äôs important to be cautious as about 80% of the items may be defective or of low quality.\n\nMany shoppers have noted that although the prices are unbeatable, the durability and functionality of the products can be hit or miss. Items might be broken, incomplete, or have manufacturing flaws, so it's wise to inspect each purchase carefully before heading to the checkout.\n\nA useful tip for shopping at Dollar1 is to go in with the right expectations and a discerning eye. Check products for any visible defects and think about whether they truly meet your needs or if you're better off investing a bit more for something more reliable elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, Dollar1 offers great potential savings for the budget-conscious shopper, but it pays to be selective and patient to sift through the mix to find the good deals that are genuinely worth taking home.""},{""reviewer"":""Yeniset Rojas gonzalez"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""Very good experience""},{""reviewer"":""Tina Fitzpatrick"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Ken Tucci"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""Everyday is a sale and sometimes the sales are worth way more than the cost""},{""reviewer"":""J F"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited 11 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Jon Hesse"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""Employees are awesome""},{""reviewer"":""Daniel Morgan"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""11 months ago"",""content"":""Be great if they sorted the items better, or had sections.

This business lacks any professionalism or moral compass when it comes to the products they sell. The items are sold or auctioned as \""New\"" when they are Used Returns or flat out Broken. They use stock photos to mislead people. Of all the items me and family have purchased maybe 1 of 10 is semi accurately listed. Customer service? Non existent. Looking over an item before leaving- you get dirty looks and disrespectful questioning. When you verify it's falsely listed and broken they shrug their shoulders and say just return it. When you reach out to the business page and the owner you get blocked immediately. The repackaged pallets are all junk that's been sorted through, the bin store side of the business might as well be dumpster diving. This place preys on desperate and gullible people and if you question anything you get pushed aside immediately.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this business unless you're in the market for broken stuff.

The real face shows up the moment there‚Äôs a problem. That‚Äôs when the act drops ‚Äî and you find out exactly what kind of people you‚Äôre really dealing with.\n\nI‚Äôve spent thousands at this store over the past year. Supported their business. One day I bought a speaker set I was told worked. Yes, it was missing two of the speakers out of 5 and a remote, but I was told it ‚Äújust needed a power cord.‚Äù I asked if I could return it if it didn‚Äôt work. Liz, the owner, said yes. That‚Äôs the only reason I bought it. Since it couldn‚Äôt be tested in the store.\n\nI ordered the cord, plugged it in ‚Äî dead. So I calmly reached out, expecting a return or exchange, like she promised.\n\nThat‚Äôs when the avoidance started.\n\nAll of a sudden, Liz was ‚Äútoo busy.‚Äù Then her mother-in-law became the new face of the store and their spokesperson. I was told Liz was ‚Äúunreachable‚Äù and that my messages would be ‚Äúpassed along.‚Äù They ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt see my messages anymore.‚Äù Right.\n\nI asked again and again to speak directly with Liz ‚Äî the person who made the deal. She stayed silent.\n\nThey were clearly hoping I‚Äôd give up. Too bad. I‚Äôve already swallowed enough broken junk from this place. I‚Äôm not throwing away another $20 just because someone couldn‚Äôt keep their word.\n\nThen Liz‚Äôs husband stepped in and threw out the tired ‚Äúas-is‚Äù excuse -like it meant something ‚Äî like I hadn‚Äôt seen that sign on the wall before. Let‚Äôs be clear: ‚ÄúAs-is‚Äù doesn‚Äôt give you the right to lie, say something works, and promise a return just to make a sale. That‚Äôs not just shady ‚Äî it‚Äôs illegal under Iowa Code 714H. Misrepresentation or deception even on ‚Äòas-is‚Äô items -is illegal.\n\nI asked again to speak directly with Liz ‚Äî the owner, the one who made the agreement. Did she respond? No. She got on the phone with her spokesperson  and had her deliver the final decision. She went along with the ‚Äòas is‚Äô policy backing the excuse her husband gave. So not only did she break her word, she didn‚Äôt even have the spine to own it herself.\n\nIf you say it works, it should work. If you say it‚Äôs returnable, honor that. And if you‚Äôre the owner who made the deal ‚Äî then own it. Don‚Äôt disappear and send your in-laws to deal with it.\n\nNot once did Liz step up and say the truth: ‚ÄúYes, I told her she could return it.‚Äù\n\nI was respectful. I gave them every chance to fix it. They could‚Äôve exchanged the item and been done. No cost to them.\n\nBut they couldn‚Äôt even send one adult message saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right ‚Äî we‚Äôll take it back.‚Äù That would‚Äôve required maturity. Instead, they ghosted me. When that didn‚Äôt work, they got snarky ‚Äî even ‚Äúliked‚Äù my message saying I wouldn‚Äôt be returning if they wouldn‚Äôt honor their word. Then deleted the like. Classy.\n\nThey treated me like the scammer ‚Äî after they disappeared. And when they got called out, they hid, lied, and hoped I‚Äôd go away. Three adults. Not one could pretend to show professionalism and say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this right.‚Äù\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt a misunderstanding. It was deliberate. Liz knew what she said. She could‚Äôve told the truth and ended it ‚Äî but instead, she let her husband and in-laws lie for her. All to keep twenty bucks.\n\nMaybe they think they‚Äôre too ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù now to care about customers. Maybe they think they can afford to lose a few ‚Äî as long as they keep up the act for the rest.\n\nBut I get it. If the truth doesn‚Äôt work, deflect. If the ‚Äúas-is‚Äù excuse doesn‚Äôt make legal sense-hide it behind your ego. And when all that‚Äôs left is accountability ‚Äî stay silent. But make sure to ‚Äúlike‚Äù the part where I say I won‚Äôt be coming back. Brilliant.\n\nNever in my life have I seen an adult go back on their word over $20. But hey ‚Äî for that $20, they earned themselves a one-star review and lost a loyal customer.\n\nSmart investment.\n\nNo more silence. No more benefit of the doubt. Just the truth ‚Äî the one thing they clearly couldn‚Äôt give me.""},{""reviewer"":""Jc Walker"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 months ago"",""content"":""Great store and great people""},{""reviewer"":""Patty Munguia"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""Great store, good prices""},{""reviewer"":""Libby Snow"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""Such a fun store!

On one hand, it‚Äôs a very standard bin store. The stuff is decent. You can‚Äôt open any boxes (workers at front will open two for you), so it‚Äôs kind of hard to know what you‚Äôre looking at. Unlike other bin stores, all of their skincare, food, and hair care is individually priced. I was disappointed to see this, as these items are usually my favorite part of bins.\nWhile we were there, the owner kicked out a man for opening a box. I get enforcing the rules, but the way he handled this was incredibly inappropriate. The owner started yelling at the customer, stating to him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd kick my own mother out, you ain‚Äôt nobody.‚Äù The owner went on this rant to him and forced him to leave. He was an elderly man (the customer) that didn‚Äôt seem like he could walk out of the store briskly (he had a bit of a limp). This seemed to frustrate the owner even more! After the customer left, the owner made an announcement to everyone in the store that this man had been a customer for three years, and now he is banned forever. All because he opened one box. Everyone in the store heard the whole thing. The owner then went out to smoke a cigarette, and threw the cigarette straight on the ground.\nOn the other hand, we were treated well, and the owner even offered me a few free skincare products that were set aside in a box. Since I couldn‚Äôt open the boxes, I ended up getting a completely different brand of lip stick in the box.

I learned that standing in line here is a waste of time. They let a few people in ahead of the crowd and give them a few minutes to shop. Those people hoover up all of the most desirable items before the crowd gets in the door. So if you don't want to wait 5 hours in hopes of getting to be one of the few in first, show up when they open.\nPersonally as long as they allow a few people in the door ahead waiting in line is a waste of time and effort. Still love this place.\n\nReally love this place, just have to exercise restraint, the value you can get here makes it easy to walk out with a pile of stuff!\n\nThey are adapting how they lay out the store very nicely. If you work at it you can find some great values.\n\nIf you are going here for Fridays, or a special event PLEASE be respectful when parking. There is ample parking available, you do not need to block people in parking 3 cars deep. Please leave others room to get out of the parking lot. Thank you!""},{""reviewer"":""ShareXP"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""We have enjoyed coming here since they opened. It's a fun spin on buying second hand stuff, and the store rewards those who share on social media. We have bought literally hundreds of things and only had a few duds. Always check out electronics and test things before you buy them\n\nIt is well managed and staffed, and occasionally you'll run into some inconsiderate and unethical customers but that isn't Discount Bins' fault. I hope they stay in business for a long while, they have tons of high value items for a lot less than retail.""},{""reviewer"":""ken Thomas"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Great""},{""reviewer"":""Raecine Brent"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Philip Nielsen"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""Edited a year ago"",""content"":""I understand your business exists to serve the local community by offering great deals and service but can you seriously limit how much stuff people buy in a single day?

His prices are ok for the most part, but he makes up for some of the higher prices on things by having discount days through the week. And he will haggle which is rare with a lot of places these days. This place also has sorting tables where he buys skids and dumps them out on the tables so you can sort through them and find deals. Most places around the tri-state charge a ridiculous 7 dollars an item, his tables are 5 dollar Saturday's. I personally say skip those over priced places and make the trip down to this place for that kind of pass the time bargins. You'll never know what you'll find.

I‚Äôve only ever regretted the times I DIDN‚ÄôT stop, never the times that I do (which  are more often than I like to admit). I can‚Äôt help but tell everyone I know about the place since I (quickly) became obsessed upon finding one thing after another that I would have spent so much more on if I were buying from a big box or online retailer. The variety and selection is always impressive and I couldn‚Äôt begin to estimate how many times I have needed to buy something for my big family and then found it here and saved paying way more plus shipping too. So yes, I spend a lot here, but I have saved exponentially more! It‚Äôs a catch-22 because I have a fear that the more people that know about it, the greater the chance that it won‚Äôt be my hidden honey-hole one day, but, more customers equal an increase in the variety of unique, useful products and more unbelievable deals for all of us! I‚Äôll continue to adore and support this little family business because I root for their success and the continued excitement and joy that it brings,  (they rock[personally]) plus I have faith that they‚Äôll continue to grow with the demand of the community. They put heart, thought, and innovation into their work and are sensitive to the needs and wants of their customer base which is a rarity in a time when most businesses or larger corporations have no qualms about letting you leave with a feeling that your business falls below their bottom line. They adapt to public response and communicate in ways that show that at their core they appreciate your patronage and do what they do for us and not the almighty dollar. There's an integrity to that which makes you feel better knowing your hard earned money is going to a cause which is certainly much more admirable than the values (or lack thereof) that you'll find at the national stores. Once in a while there may be a stock of necessity item on the $1 rack and I'll hear someone say, \""Well that's about what they are in the store\"". I like to toss some in my bag and let them know that I'd much rather give that $1 to a place like this. And guess what, they saved me a trip and a separate checkout too. Better here than to a place that's in the business of increasing profits with no regard to the affects to the little people! When you can't even go to the $tree and get something for $1 these days, so I'll buy better quality items here for less all week long. (And I do). The thrill of the hunt and the awe of the deals have an addicting draw and our sleepy town badly needed a cool place like this to inject life and hope during these unpredictable times. Their transparent and predetermined pricing has been a routine comfort for many people. including myself, who had become resigned to living with that feeling after checkout, that you spent more than you got. This is one of the few places where it's the exact opposite and it seems like that's the way they want it!""}]","{""mapquest"":""https://www.mapquest.com/us/kentucky/new-beginnings-sales-535237175"",""find-open"":""https://find-open.com/owingsville/new-beginnings-sales-bin-store-15954550"",""facebook"":""https://www.facebook.com/newbeginnings.sales/albums/550788153736225/""}","Kentucky",,"Wheelchair accessible entrance","40360","{""images"":""page.waitForSelector: Timeout 20000ms exceeded.\nCall log:\n\u001b[2m  - waiting for locator('.U39Pmb[style]') to be visible\u001b[22m\n""}"

Friday morning, folks are already lined up out front to experience the fun of great deals. But whether you're first in line or the last one in the door, you have the same opportunity to snag awesome items.\nBig blue shopping bags are given to start with so that buggies aren't blocking everyone.\nThe available items are spread out over many tables and they're all covered until the countdown is done, and then shoppers pull the cloth off and start shopping. You don't know what might be under that cloth on that table.\nMany items are in unmarked boxes and you'll have to take them to the open box stations to have them opened for you. Do Not open boxes yourself or you'll get in trouble and possibly banned. Opening boxes causes stuff to go missing.\nThey work really hard to make this a fun, exciting and organized chaotic event. No fussing or fighting over items and don't even think about taking items from others buggies. This is considered stealing.\nIn other words, mind your manners and don't act like your Mama didn't raise you right, and we can all have fun and get some good stuff for $8.\nSaturday is $6, Sunday is $4, Monday is $2, Tuesday $1 and anything left on Wednesday is 50 cent.\nThursdays they restock and Friday we start again.\nEveryone who works there is incredibly nice and those who work there, can't shop there.\nHonestly, once you get through the \""deer in headlights\"" first time shopping on Friday morning, you will find your footing and enjoy digging for bargains.\nMany bin stores close up quickly because people can't act right and no one wants to shop in that kind of environment.

Fast forward to today, we walked around got a few things then made our way to the coffee area I picked up a bag of beans put them down and proceeded to the other side to check out the Starbucks coffee there. Out of nowhere the im assuming owner pops out and says \"" you can eat them it's ok\"" im flabbergasted at this point and respond with its ok I don't eat coffee beans thinking it was a joke, he then responds oh someone said you were eating. So now I'm just offended as I'm wearing 500$ glasses and my mom has spent a lot of money in this store. He then walks away unapologetic and says nothing.

I‚Äôve only ever regretted the times I DIDN‚ÄôT stop, never the times that I do (which  are more often than I like to admit). I can‚Äôt help but tell everyone I know about the place since I (quickly) became obsessed upon finding one thing after another that I would have spent so much more on if I were buying from a big box or online retailer. The variety and selection is always impressive and I couldn‚Äôt begin to estimate how many times I have needed to buy something for my big family and then found it here and saved paying way more plus shipping too. So yes, I spend a lot here, but I have saved exponentially more! It‚Äôs a catch-22 because I have a fear that the more people that know about it, the greater the chance that it won‚Äôt be my hidden honey-hole one day, but, more customers equal an increase in the variety of unique, useful products and more unbelievable deals for all of us! I‚Äôll continue to adore and support this little family business because I root for their success and the continued excitement and joy that it brings,  (they rock[personally]) plus I have faith that they‚Äôll continue to grow with the demand of the community. They put heart, thought, and innovation into their work and are sensitive to the needs and wants of their customer base which is a rarity in a time when most businesses or larger corporations have no qualms about letting you leave with a feeling that your business falls below their bottom line. They adapt to public response and communicate in ways that show that at their core they appreciate your patronage and do what they do for us and not the almighty dollar. There's an integrity to that which makes you feel better knowing your hard earned money is going to a cause which is certainly much more admirable than the values (or lack thereof) that you'll find at the national stores. Once in a while there may be a stock of necessity item on the $1 rack and I'll hear someone say, \""Well that's about what they are in the store\"". I like to toss some in my bag and let them know that I'd much rather give that $1 to a place like this. And guess what, they saved me a trip and a separate checkout too. Better here than to a place that's in the business of increasing profits with no regard to the affects to the little people! When you can't even go to the $tree and get something for $1 these days, so I'll buy better quality items here for less all week long. (And I do). The thrill of the hunt and the awe of the deals have an addicting draw and our sleepy town badly needed a cool place like this to inject life and hope during these unpredictable times. Their transparent and predetermined pricing has been a routine comfort for many people. including myself, who had become resigned to living with that feeling after checkout, that you spent more than you got. This is one of the few places where it's the exact opposite and it seems like that's the way they want it!""},{""reviewer"":""Tyler Denton"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""Lots of good stuff""}]","{""mapquest"":""https://www.mapquest.com/us/kentucky/new-beginnings-sales-535237175"",""find-open"":""https://find-open.com/owingsville/new-beginnings-sales-bin-store-15954550"",""facebook"":""https://www.facebook.com/newbeginnings.sales/albums/550788153736225/""}","Kentucky",,"Wheelchair accessible entrance","40360","{""images"":""page.waitForSelector: Timeout 20000ms exceeded.\nCall log:\n\u001b[2m  - waiting for locator('.U39Pmb[style]') to be visible\u001b[22m\n""}"

She had the intention of purchasing a coffee maker after seeing the promotions on social media. She showed up at around 6:30 am and waited until they opened. When they opened the doors, she was fortunate enough to grab one along with a few other items. Once she grabbed around five or six items, she took them to the testing table to check the condition of the items, as the store allows you to do that. This is when the issues started. The manager that shop was giving very aggressive looks to my wife while she was waiting in the testing line. When she got to the table, he began harassing her. He would not allow her to test a few of her items and started to yell at her for no reason. He was insisting that the items were in good condition and she did not need to test them. She only wanted to ensure the products she was going to buy weren't damaged. After being harassed and humiliated, she proceeded to check out. The manager again began harassing my wife by saying she didn't have the necessary amount of items to check out. My wife was unaware, but when you purchase a high value item, such as a coffee maker, they demand you buy $90-100 worth of merchandise. This was not posted or displayed anywhere in the store. When my wife went to checkout, the cashiers were willing to let my wife checkout without any issues, it was the manager that began causing trouble and yelling at her and treating her as if she was trying to rob them. The workers were all apologizing to my wife and they made it known to my wife that they all hate the manager and think he's the worst person in the world. One of them even informed my wife that she wanted to quit after working there for years just because of the manager. Eventually it became too much for my wife and she began to tear up and confront the manager. He then proceeded to make sexist remarks towards my wife by saying that she's acting like a woman and becoming emotional for no reason. HE CONTINUED TO BELITTLE HER AND GET IN HER FACE WHILE SHE WAS CRYING. My just rang up what she had and left immediately. I called the owner to let inform him of what happened. We will never return to this store because of the way my wife was treated for not knowing the policies. NEVER SHOP HERE.

Unfortunately, it was a somewhat of a disappointment.\nIt is not worth going out of your way to shop here.  I'll return if I'm also going somewhere else in Mason.\n\nI stopped by on a Thursday and got a 6-foot iPhone cord for $4 (usually $10+ at Marshalls/TJ Maxx) which paid for the gasoline to get there.\nThere were other items that I might have purchased, but they weren't urgently needed, so I decided to wait until Saturday for 25¬¢ day.  That was worthless because they blocked off all the good stuff on that day and everything else was, almost literally, garbage (as I was leaving, I encountered 2 other people who were also disgusted with the selection).\n\nBecause I really wanted to give this place a chance to impress me, I went back for a 3rd time on the following Friday and got 6 somewhat needed items for $2 each.  I also noticed that Saturdays are now $1 instead of 25¬¢ (so maybe they now won't be removing the good stuff from the sales floor??).\n\nThis place would be so much better and well worth the 25-minute drive if they were set up differently:\n1)  The bins are way too deep, resulting in a lot of damaged items and a lot of my precious time being wasted by digging (Daily Dealz had very shallow bins).\nAlso, by having deep bins, they are not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (no one in a wheel chair is able to shop here).\n2)  Food and pills should be displayed on shelves, not in bins to keep them from being contaminated (like Daily Dealz used to do).\n3)  Clothing should be on hangers (again like Daily Dealz used to do).\n4)  I understand that \""bin store\"" is a trendy thing and a small percentage of people love the hunt.  But I say \""people can't buy what they cannot find\"".\nThey would have a lot more business if items were on shelves.\nAlso, with most of the merchandise being damaged due to the extra deep bins, I can only imagine that they have to discard a huge percentage of their inventory (bins, especially these deep ones, do not make good business sense).\n\nThis place is just a dumping ground for the overpriced items they can't sell at the regular B2 Outlets.\nMany items had Target and Home Goods clearance price tags (whereas Daily Dealz was mostly Amazon returns).""},{""reviewer"":""Tim Matthews"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Tim, thank you so much for the great rating!

First and foremost, the behavior of the staff was unacceptable. Despite the fact that each item was only $1 on Fridays, the staff seemed indifferent and unprofessional.\n\nOne major issue was the closure of the testing area. This area is available for customers to test items they wish to purchase, but it was inexplicably closed on Friday. When I asked about this, I was rudely informed by a staff member that the testing area is specifically closed on Fridays. This decision is baffling and disrespectful to customers, implying that those shopping on Fridays are only interested in junk.\n\nIt is concerning that the staff's arrogance and rude behavior go unchecked. If the store owner or stakeholders do not address this issue, the store's reputation will suffer, and it may eventually face closure. Customer satisfaction is crucial for any business, and making customers unhappy is a surefire way to lose their patronage.\n\nI strongly urge the management to reconsider their policies and ensure their staff treat customers with respect.

My First Dive into the Bargain Bin Craze üõíüí¨\n\nAs someone who‚Äôs passionate about the thrill of the hunt, I‚Äôve always been drawn to the mystique of bargain bin stores‚Äîthose unpredictable treasure troves where, theoretically, yesterday‚Äôs overstock becomes today‚Äôs best-kept secret. So when I stepped into this particular bin store, I came with high hopes, a curious mind, and an eager heart.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the concept‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs genius on paper. Picture this: rows of bins filled with thousands of unclaimed or returned items from major retailers, all marked at a fraction of their original price. It‚Äôs the kind of setup that ignites your inner deal-hunter and promises the kind of score you‚Äôll want to brag about later. At least, that‚Äôs the idea.\n\nüß© The Experience:\nWalking in, the environment had the electric buzz of possibility. Shoppers shuffled around, eyes scanning for hidden value, hands diving into the mystery beneath the surface of the bins. It felt like a modern-day gold rush.\n\nBut after sifting through bin after bin, the excitement began to wane. Many of the items were incomplete, damaged, or not worth their marked price‚Äîeven with the discount. A lot of what I found felt like second-tier overflow rather than legitimate bargains. It wasn‚Äôt about striking gold; it felt more like panning for copper.\n\nüí° The Takeaway:\nI didn‚Äôt walk away with any treasures on this first visit. Most of what I grabbed left me thinking, ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve found this cheaper elsewhere‚Äîor in better condition.‚Äù And that‚Äôs an important part of the review: It‚Äôs not just about price‚Äîit‚Äôs about value.\n\nüß≠ Why I‚Äôm Still Hopeful:\nThis wasn‚Äôt a total loss. Every treasure hunter knows that not every expedition ends in gold. I believe in second chances, especially when the concept is this solid. Perhaps I came on a lower-volume day, or maybe the best deals are scooped up earlier in the week. I‚Äôll return‚Äîwith sharper timing, clearer strategy, and higher expectations.\n\nüìù Final Thoughts (for now):\nThe idea of discovering high-value items for bargain-bin prices is incredibly appealing, but execution matters. As a reviewer, I‚Äôm not just chasing hype‚ÄîI‚Äôm chasing honesty, consistency, and real wins for everyday people. This place has potential. But potential, by itself, doesn‚Äôt fill a shopping bag.\n\nSo stay tuned‚ÄîI‚Äôll be back. And next time, I‚Äôll either strike gold‚Ä¶ or tell you exactly where not to dig.\n\nüîî Follow for more brutally honest, real-world reviews‚Äîfrom hidden gems to hype busters.""},{""reviewer"":""Sarah Goodrich"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""2 weeks ago"",""content"":""Bought a brand new coffee pot and it won't brew anything they say you can test it first before you buy but how are you supposed to test before you buy without coffee or water she said no refunds or exchanges why does Springfields gives 30 days to bring back but not this one very shady this one in Ozark is""},{""reviewer"":""Jessica Stillings"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 weeks ago"",""content"":""Always over spend here, they just have so much to look at.""},{""reviewer"":""Patricia Dawn Reid"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Lloyd Eston"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Brian Jones"",""rating"":""2/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""Very small""},{""reviewer"":""Jason Bay"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Rachel DeLong"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""Love this place!""},{""reviewer"":""Amber Hesselberg"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited 4 months ago"",""content"":""I love this store!""},{""reviewer"":""Vicki"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""My son and I enjoy digging for treasures.

She told me as long as I kept my receipt, I could return it within 48 hours but assumed it was good. I went to my in laws to check it out and see if the pump was in it and sure enough, it didn‚Äôt have one. I went back to return it within an hour of purchase and I was told they couldn‚Äôt return it because one guy wasn‚Äôt there which is understandable. I explained I lived out of state because my husband is military and stationed somewhere else and asked if family could return it tomorrow when he‚Äôs there in which she told me only for store credit. I understand having to come back because someone was gone, but she NEVER said it‚Äôd be for store credit only when I purchased it. Simply said I could come back in 48 hours with the receipt for a refund. I get it, you guys have a business to run but it was one of the nicer items to the side so I‚Äôd expect it to be checked if you‚Äôre going to sell those items at a higher price.

ALMOST $300 WORTH OF BROKEN ITEMS THAT I WAS RE ASSURD WORKED WHEN PURCHASING!!!\n\nI will start out by saying the lady up front was so helpful and was doing all she could for me because she KNEW I was lied to.  I previously bought two bass pro chairs and a shark matrix vacuum. I was specifically told by the owner that all items were tested and they do work. I even asked a couple times just to be sure and he assured me all items have been tested. We get home and BOTH Chairs ARE BROKEN AND MISSING PIECES. You can‚Äôt even sit in the chairs. They definitely were not opened nor tested. So now I‚Äôm out $80 for broken chairs. I messaged him and he old me bring them on Monday.  Then get to the $200 shark vacuum he re assured me I was getting a hell of a deal on. Set it up- turn it on and sure enough it‚Äôs broken to. I didn‚Äôt want to bother him so I thought I‚Äôd bring that on Monday to. I get there and I‚Äôm told items actually ARE NOT being tested because they are short staffed- which I get it great but don‚Äôt walk around telling everyone everything‚Äôs already been tested‚Ä¶.? So the solution was leave the chairs for him to work on and give back to me and swap the shark vacuum for the other one they had out. Great whatever. Open the other shark vacuum and not only does it not work it‚Äôs all tore up on the bottom so therefore once again not tested. So I get there Monday like he told me to do and one he‚Äôs gone and I‚Äôm told to come back tomorrow after he told me to come. His employee gets him on the phone with me and he instantly starts yelling at me like it‚Äôs my fault???He then wants me to leave my items there- No refund- like what? He sold me broken items after re assuring me they worked and tested several times then now wants me to keep my broken items? Nothing said broken or refurbished or anything we were told it all works. From the beginning he was very rude and unprofessional. So now I have $280 of items with me that don‚Äôt work. Waste of time waste of money. Owners lies and is very hateful and rude. SO BEWARE. Items are not tested and he will lie straight to your face about it.""},{""reviewer"":""Lynn Stewart"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Love this store!

The store opens at 9AM and there are lines half an hour ahead of time on Wednesday and Friday.  Friday is their restock day but also the most expensive day of the week.  You can buy anything except fresh foods here, they sell everything from (hopefully not used) sex toys to car parts, household linens, clothing, toiletries, luxury items, decorations, electronics, furniture etc.  First time I went I spent $26.00 on over $900.00 worth of merchandise.  If I was any good with resale I could make bank off this store.  Beware of expired, broken and incomplete items.  I gave it 5 stars because of the savings you can make, but as far as stores go, this is basically set up like the most disorganized yardsale ever with all new items every week.""},{""reviewer"":""Michelle Raney"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Michelle McGinnis"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited 2 years ago"",""content"":""Love this place!!

You never know what you will find and it is like going on a treasure hunt because you need to take the time to look.  You also have to be patient.  On Friday, the $10 day, only buy what is worth $10 or more.  If you like something that you consider to be worth less, take a chance and come back on a cheaper day when the price goes down.  I happen to like Sundays for $6 or Mondays for $4.  You can still find some quality items for a great buy.  All the junk is left on Tuesday and Wednesday.   But you still never know....

TVs, drones, etc.  You must have to go at certain times or when the doors open, but unfortunately some people have jobs and cannot be at beck and call of the store's timing.

I was originally going to give a higher rating, but this ruined it.\n\nIt was sealed in a bag, a bathroom toilet scrubber.

There's lots of room for improvement, though. The items for sale in the cases and that are not in the bins are way overpriced. I've seen several items that could go on a $10 day... but there should also be LOTS of room for negotiation, and it should be posted that they'll do so. They should also completely change the items out from $8 dollar day to $10 dollar day. And I know you aren't supposed to open boxes on your own, but there are tons of people who do it and therefore missing pieces in LOTS of boxes. As of right now, I prefer the bin store off Bridford Pkwy more than this one.

This place got tons of them, and they‚Äôre not all no name brands. There‚Äôs a lot of Belkin and Anker chargers, cables, and power banks. Cases and screen protectors such as otterbox and invisible glass are available here as well, all at a flat rate price depending on the day. Getting well known brands for a fraction of the cost makes it worth the trip.\n\nI‚Äôm putting at 4 stars because the stuff there can get pretty stagnant in terms of product variety. As mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs mostly been phone accessories and a handful of gaming console accessories. It‚Äôs pretty obvious some products aren‚Äôt moving/sold as I‚Äôm seeing the same stuff every other week.\n\nAdditionally, there‚Äôs a sizable number of products that are outright broken and is essentially disposable. Maybe designate an area to place broken items or have someone regularly remove them from the pile.\n\nAs for the customer experience, the staff there is a pleasure to be around, they‚Äôre really chill and approachable, and ready to help you.\n\n2022 Update:\nReview sentiment is the same. The items in the bins have improved as there are products worth a couple hundreds of dollars if you go there on the high price days ($6-$7). Got me a couple Samsung sound bars that works perfectly as well as new steel series gaming headphones.\n\nProducts are good enough to warrant a trip there if you need some Apple/Android (official/Belkin/Anker/Aukey/etc.) accessories for a few bucks rather than spending $20 on a single charger cable at Walmart.\n\nThere will be your occasional golden ticket items such as me finding a 2021 OLED Nintendo switch (missing Joycons), or an actual Dual Sense (PS5) controller, but that requires actual effort in digging.""},{""reviewer"":""Ursula A.

As I was shopping, a worker approached me and stated that I would have to put back the boxes that I had pulled from the back to the front of the bin. I would have to put the boxes back exactly where they were in the bin. I said that I would not, that was not my job. She clapped her hands at me and said I would have to leave. I was appalled. She even had security to walk me out, like I was a common criminal, for shopping.   I  pointed out that everyone was doing the same as I was, SHOPPING. NO ONE ELSE WAS ASKED TO LEAVE.

I asked about it and they said everything is sold as is, we are not allowed to test it.\n\nI had purchased a heating pad one day and the heating pad did not work. YOU ARE TAKING A CHANCE ON ELECTRONICS.\n\nYou can take any package to the back counter and open any package to inspect. (Don't open in the bins, they don't want you to do that.) ALWAYS OPEN THE BOXES to things you want to consider purchasing TO BE SURE ALL THE PIECES ARE THERE because when other people open them, they throw them back in the bins sometimes and things fall out.\n\nThe other items that are larger, more expensive purchases (stoves, computers, etc ) are able to be brought back but only for store credit. No cash or actual money back.\n\nCARD FEE IS $1.25\n\nMake sure you pay attention to the price of the day.

Today though, I found a workers tape gun and gave it back to the worker because I figured one of the employees lost it. Then I was trying to sort through the stuff to find what I wanted so I grouped these blue boxes that contained Chinese magnetic checkers and a worker asked me was I buying them. I said no. She said her boss would want them all put back in every bin. I've worked retail for several years and I found that remark insane. You've got a bin for phones, a bin for clothes, and a bin for books. But you don't want a bin all to itself for games. These chinese magnetic checkers were $1 today and absolutely no one, NO ONE, wants to buy them. God forbid I try to help organize your store to help your workers and do some OCD organization. Also, you should open up the cardboard boxes and but them into clear bags, else you're gonna get 50 people opening up the same box every day. Also, I applied to work at this place and they denied me- so they only hire friends and family. They charge a bag fee and a card fee. There's no AC in the summer time. 1 out of 5 stars.

I spent about an hour looking through the bins. I found a water pic, $80 value and a rechargeable hand warmer, $30 value. It was nice to find those gems, we had pleasant conversations with a few of the employees, and everything was good till the end.\nAt the register, the fella ahead of me was told that there was a $1.50 fee for using a credit card. He balked at that news as did I. I‚Äôm not used to that in retail and am tired of getting squeezed at every turn. Well the young clerk got completely irate! She threw his items around, threatened to not sell them to him, shouting ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come back, we don‚Äôt want you here!‚Äù He left, and because I audibly balked, she continued her tirade on me! Completely unprofessional and uncalled for. AFTER I checked out, I noticed a sign about their card usage fee about waist high directly in front of the register. As you continue along the line to pay, no one naturally steps back to look for signage. It should be more visibly placed before you approach the line.\nSo the shopping was decent, the policies are shady, but that clerk who went berserk is what earned them just two stars and why I won‚Äôt be returning.

Dont bother coming on a saturday because the pass people get into the store 30 minutes early, they are allowed to stay in the store until it opens at 9. Which means and in which case i have witnessed them reloading their bags a second time before us regular paying customers even get a chance to look at the merchandise.\nWhat is the point of waiting for them to open at 9 when the other people are still in the store, its an unfair advantage. Not to mention the staff is obviously not on the same page because 1 lady is saying their passes are $50 dollars and another is saying their $40. To add on to it they seemingly dont even know when their restocking their own merchandise. I asked 1 lady if they were restocking on a saturday because i happened to see it in a live video on facebook. So when i asked she told me no but another employee said yes. If your employees are not on the same page it leads to misinformation, so dont get irritated at the customer for asking you questions when obviously your own staff dont have the answers. They let kids run around the store, getting in the way of paying customers. They let the pass buyers leave all their opened, unpaid for bags all over the floor. Honestly ive seen better stores in the slums with better policies.

Apparently the new managers didn't want this to be known to the public. Why report a 5 star review and have it taken down? It makes no sense.\n\nReply to Daa Bin Store's response.\nI searched for the review on a friends phone, signed out of Google and went incognito mode and the review is definitely gone from the site.\nAnd the review hadn't moved for many months until the recent change in manager. The only way a review can be removed is if it's reported to Google. I don't see any reason why a regular customer would report it to Google for removal, there was nothing offensive in it. I think customers would like to know that it's possible to have an item stolen or taken from your bag when you're not looking.

The last 8-10 months it has gone way down hill.\n\nI'm not able to utilize the in store stuff so much since I have mobility issues and can't stand at the bins and go through the mountain of junk while looking for the rare gem.\n\nI have been bidding on the auction items and something's not right with them.  Not once, not twice, not three times but four separate times, I have put in my right before the end of the auction, watched the timer tick down to zero, see that the ending bid is within the range between my starting bid and my max bid, get excited because I assume it was a legit auction and I had \""won\"" it, check and see that it's listed under \""auctions I have won\"", check my email for the invoice on Wednesday morning and then POOF two of the three things that I had won from last night had evaporated from my account page.  This is the fourth time this has happened to me.  Infuriatingly, three of those times involved a certain item that I've been trying to \""win\"" from the bin store.  Every time I win the auction, every time someone removes it from my account. Weird.\n\nIf someone there wanted to set these items aside for themselves or for a friend or family member, they should've done that before posting these on the auction.

We weren‚Äôt looking for anything specific, more so to look around. We were in there for a good while and it was clear how the store was set up: the most expensive items are on the sides and walls of the store with price tags that vary based on the price of the item, these expensive items are completely separate from the daily prices, and the other items are on tables in the middle; these are what you would pay the daily prices for. Today was a Friday, meaning that all of the items on the tables would be $7. After about twenty minutes of looking around, I found an Owlet sock for babies that costs $300 on Amazon in the tables in the middle. This meant that I would have paid $7 for it. I grabbed it and put it in our cart because I was planning to buy it. My mom and I shopped around some more and even asked the clerk nicely if we could open some boxes and he said yes, just handle the boxes nicely if we were to open them. Throughout the whole time we were there, the clerk was very nice to us and explained how he gets his merchandise and such. When it was time for us to check out, we told him how we were going to split the boxes in our cart; my mom was paying for 4 boxes and I was paying for one box. He got caught up in the moment because he saw that I was buying the Owlet sock. He took the box out of my hands and said that the box wasn‚Äôt supposed to be out on the tables. He started speaking very fast and started tripping over his words. My mom told him that we found it on the table all the way across the room, so it would‚Äôve been impossible for me to grab it from the expensive shelves without him looking. I forgot to mention that the expensive item shelves are behind a glass counter, so only employees can access the items. He said I couldn‚Äôt buy it for $7 but was willing to make a deal. I said no worries, and just simply did not buy the Owlet sock. My mom was ready to check out and asked him before paying if it was $7 day and he confirmed. We leave the store and it‚Äôs not until we get in the car that my mom realized that she had paid more than she should have. I said that she paid with card, and there was a sign that said a small charge will be applied if paying with card, so that must‚Äôve been the extra charge. She said that it still didn‚Äôt add up, she paid for 4 boxes so her subtotal was $28, and counting tax and whatever the card fee would‚Äôve been still wouldn‚Äôt add up to what she paid which was $35. She decided to go back in and ask anyway. This is when the clerk started getting worked up and said that she lied about asking if it was $7 day. My mom had been charged $8 per box even though it clearly stated everywhere that Fridays are $7. He kept arguing with my mom and told her to never come back. We got the receipt and he had charged us the price for Saturdays. The receipt clearly states the date being 10/11/2024, which is a Friday. Overall it was an awful experience and we will not be back.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly and helpful staff who made me feel welcome and comfortable.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was the affordable prices. As someone who loves a good bargain, I was pleasantly surprised by the low prices of the items at Rainbum Liquidation. I was able to find some amazing deals on clothing, home goods, and even electronics. It's rare to find such great quality items at such affordable prices, but Rainbum Liquidation definitely delivers.\n\nThe selection at Rainbum Liquidation is also top-notch. They have a wide variety of products ranging from clothing and accessories to household items and electronics. I was able to find everything I needed in one place, which made my shopping experience so much easier and more convenient.\n\nBut what really stood out to me were the items themselves. The quality of the products at Rainbum Liquidation is exceptional. I was able to find brand name items at a fraction of the cost, which is a huge plus for me. I also appreciated that the items were in great condition, making it feel like I was getting a steal with each purchase.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Rainbum Liquidation to anyone looking for affordable and high-quality items. The staff, prices, selection, and items themselves all exceeded my expectations.

I go to six different locations. Jamal, RainBum Liquidation has, without a doubt, some of the best quality merchandise at the lowest prices anywhere in Oklahoma City. I have found items worth 20 to 30 times the price Jamal charges. He is also one of the nicest, kindest, most friendly gentlemen I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with. I hesitate to post this review because more people will flock to his small but expansive shop to snatch up incredible bargains but, I owe it to him and hard-working Oklahomans looking for bargains to give him and RainBum Liquidation a huge shoutout and recognition for a hard-working man dishing out some of the best deals in the country.\n\nHis inventory includes thousands of items; from housewares, computer accessories, pet supplies, outdoor gear, kid's toys, books, collectibles, and so much more.\n\nWhen you go to his shop located in the shopping center at NW 50th and Meridian Avenue in OKC, please extend him and your fellow shoppers some common courtesies. Don't tear open the boxes and throw his merchandise all over the place and DON'T STEAL FROM HIM. He is more than willing to assist you if you don't know how to identify products and he works too hard for jerks to steal from him when the prices are so low, you feel like you are practically stealing them when you pay for them.\n\nThanks, Jamal, for offering these incredible bargains.

I‚Äôm sure the kid at the register didn‚Äôt realize this but the AirPod maxes they sold me are fake. Great dupes for sure, but the cups and crown for volume are plastic- not aluminum. The ding for connection and transitions from pause to play are not smooth. I would have paid $60-80 for headphones like this for the audio quality - but not the $200 I paid for what I thought was an authentic Apple product.\nAside from the product dissatisfaction, the customer service is great and the deals are nice! We paid $25 for a kettlebell set that we are happy with.""},{""reviewer"":""Susan Milligan"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""I was iffy about going in this shop, as the other few I have visited were dirty.

I went inside looking for just a phone case and the sweet girl working up front handed me one of those blue ikea bags. I told her no thank you I‚Äôm looking for a phone case, literally all I was in there for, and I handed it back to her. She‚Äôd told me she was going to leave it by me in case I needed it. Ok fine.\n\nAn older man with long hair came by (I assume the manager) and started shouting at the girl who helped me. He was so loud EVERYBODY heard. In summary he made a huge deal about how the workers dont know how to do their job because we were not taking the ikea bags.\n\nBut what is she supposed to do? Force me to take a bag even if I politely say no? That is a pathetic marketing scheme and I desire to shop for what I want in peace. If I want a bag I will walk over there and grab one. How come you people don't just keep a bag rack every few feet throughout the store if it's such a big deal???\n\nHe pointed at another customer (I did witness the cashier give her a bag and the lady put it back on the bag rack) and he looked and pointed at me as if I was part of the problem. When customers REFUSE one ITS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT ONE!!!!!! When one goes to the store, you don't get a basket for just a handful or less of items, and if you need a basket later you get one!!\n\nLack of shopping basket has never stopped me or anyone from purchasing the things one wants or finds along the way.\n\nI am bewildered that he told the cashier to tell customers that \""the owners are watching cameras and they may get fired if they don‚Äôt take a bag\"". If the owner is doing that then maybe that poor cashier needs a new job with a great leader and not some \""boss\"" who threatens their job. I did walk out shortly afterwards and will not go back nor support local establishments who threaten decent employees. I only hope anyone working there gets up and finds work somewhere they are valued.""},{""reviewer"":""Kayla Wilkerson"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""Omgggg my new addiction!!

They have A LOT of dollar section items from Target, meaning items originally priced $1-$5 are now marked $8 on Fridays. I do like that they have a whole side dedicated to home items at a discount, and a big sign out front telling parents to keep their kids with them.\nI will admit I misread the sign out front and thought everything was $3 (only clothes and jewelry were). While shopping my baby woke up a little bit earlier from her nap than normal and I found a container of puffs so I popped them open to give them to her while we were in line. It‚Äôs a brand I normally purchase and I know they‚Äôre about $4. I figured I was saving a dollar and other customers from hearing her scream while also being able to purchase what I had with me. Imagine my surprise when the $4 puffs were actually $8! I paid for them anyways without complaint. But don‚Äôt be like me and instead just pull out your target/Amazon app and scan the barcodes to make sure you‚Äôre actually getting a deal. They heavily advertise coming on Mondays and how Monday is the cheapest day, but just‚Ä¶ lower the prices maybe?\nOtherwise, there‚Äôs a bigger store called Black Friday Deals in OKC off 16th that prices items a lot lower.""},{""reviewer"":""stephanie kennett"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited a year ago"",""content"":""Pretty good stuff in there Mondays r dollar day""},{""reviewer"":""Garrett Hofmann"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Thank you !""},{""reviewer"":""Pamela Valentine"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Best deals ever""},{""reviewer"":""P Valentine"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""I love this store prices change daily making them less expensive.""},{""reviewer"":""Scarlet Merlin"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""I love this store.

There was hardly any mdse in the bins. Anything that I was remotely interested in was either cracked, broken, missing pieces, or chipped. Items like that should be removed. People are just rummaging through and tearing open packages. Tearing apart curtain packages and just throwing them back in the bin.  There was even a jarred candle that was burned down so far that there was barely any candle left. It felt like I was in G***w*** shopping. It was very disappointing.

Several items of kids clothes had stains on them or shoes that were previously worn. Staff members would throw items back into the bins & the inventory seemed to be broken, smashed, or missing items (like a reusable cup with no straw, etc.).\nThey have a bin side where items are all one price & then a shop side where items are individually priced. The shop seemed to be marginally discounted based on retail price. For example they would have 3 chairs or 1 chair, so was difficult to find a complete set. They did have a carseat travel system for $198 and it was 50% off when I was there. (However this is not something i needed, but a good price with the discount). However the inventory is always changing.\nWhile you can search and find some decent items, checkout was very long.\nThey are open Thursday - Monday & the price drops each day on items both in the bin and shop side, Thursday being the most expensive & Monday being the cheapest.\nThis review was based on a Monday experience. I left with nothing because the checkout line was very long & moving slowly even with cashiers working (people would have carts filled to the brim and would take a very long time checking out). Im sure checkout gets better through the day, but the items i found were not worth the wait at the time. Like other reviews it has s good layout, but is chaotic and some shoppers did seem aggressive to get to items.

Line out the door on Monday to get in at 10am.  There is a bin side and other side with more expensive items.   Lots of things from Target/home goods etc.   Got $1: huge bath bombs, these are usually $8 and my granddaughter loves them, large name brand shampoo, super cute curtains, shower curtain rods etc.  Lots of random holiday off season things.  It is pretty crowded/small space, maybe not this hectic on other days but not a fan of having to push through the chaos to save a few bucks.   Some folks are literally throwing stuff around, pushing you with their carts and generally being aggressively pushy.  Probably would not have been as bothersome had I not had a small child with me.

Maybe you need to have a bin separate from the weekly bins and not mix the $15 items in with the other items because of course that is going to cause confusion, when I go in to shop I am expecting to buy items marked for that day, I do know that the shoes and items on the shelves against the wall are priced higher but the bins are supposed to be the price for that day.

The staff is extremely friendly and they make your shopping experience amazing. The bins themselves are like nothing else I have encountered in my shopping experience. The prices get lower every day but even on the most expensive day, you are getting a serious discount on items you find. You can fill a bag (grocery bags they have provided at the store) for $20 and the amount of clothes I have essentially gotten for free really makes this place something special. When I think of the economy and where I want to spend my money, I think of a place that makes me feel like family. They also always make sure you have all the info and can check all your items before you leave. I love that they allow you to open boxes at the register to make sure all items are accounted for or that the item works.\n\nI also want to point out that they have a section that is general merchandise which is items that are individually priced. The items here are 50%+ off retail and usually a VERY good deal. I have purchased two LED face masks from this section and both were amazing and I couldn't believe what I paid, in compared to what it cost on Amazon.\n\nAll in all, if you are on a budget and looking for a place that isn't using tariffs to bankrupt you, this is your home.

Honestly if the Fire Marshall was to come in this place would most likely be shut down. There is only 1 exit that is usable and it is ultimately being blocked by people in line either trying to check out or looking at bin items and the General merch blocking doorways. 2ndly they have way too many customers in the space at one time, they need to either limit the number of people that come in at a time and not allow wholesaler to do their research of items while shopping this is preventing other customers from coming in and or looking at items in bins.  Again this is a great idea but safety should be a priority here and sadly based off our 1st trip in it doesnt look that way.

That attracted a lot more people than having a couple shelves of extremely poor deals which make it obvious that the secret santa stashed items that you might find have already been combed out and put on the shelves.   The store would do much better if you kept that vibe going where we might actually find BEATS earbuds or an iphone or a laptop on saturday even.   All that overpriced junk only hurts your business and really, it seems to just sit there and clutter up your store anyways.  It takes away the feel that you might actually find something valueable on 2.50 day that someone missed.   Don't get me wrong, there are deals here.  But you can't really say that you have set prices and everything goes into the bins.  That was the way the store worked initially ... at least that's what the public concensus was.

Whenever I can, I check out the store. You have to go early and know which days the best things are. There are days when things are cheaper after 4 p.m. I almost always go to see what I can find and see if they're at good prices. I try to go on days when they're $7, $4, and $3. You can find a lot of household items, but you have to have the time and patience to go through box by box and be willing to open some that are tightly sealed. I recommend downloading the Amazon app if you don't have it, because that way you can take a photo of the item and know if you're making a good purchase. These are things that Amazon customers have returned, either because they don't want it or because they've used it and returned it. And like everything, the seasons are important in all of this. Because when this store opened, it was at the end of last year, November 2024, and you could find a lot of Christmas accessories and decorations, a lot. Also, ridiculously cheap Halloween costumes for $5. So keep this in mind. I can tell you that you can find a lot of things at very good prices. Shoes, sandals, activity mats, and so much more. But you should know that you'll rarely find the same thing twice. As I said, these are things that are returned, and they don't always have the same items or the same quantities. One day, shoes were $4 for $5.""},{""reviewer"":""Awilda rosa"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""I've been there twice and I like it.

I have purchased Yankee candles, toaster, Stanley tumblers, some hiking boots, bed sheets etc. I love it, my husband even purchased a bicycle last week for $70 and original price was $200, the problem with the bike was the brakes which we fixed and one of the tires tubes was broken.

I advise parents to WATCH OUT FOR THE ARAB GUY AROUND YOUR KIDS!\n\nI was there today with my 3 year old, I handed an already opened wand toy with lights so he could play with next to me and my mom while we looked in the bins. Well, the wand fell apart as it was the kind that you can assemble back together and I let him try to figure it out (to keep him entertained). An Arab guy says here little guy to my son and assembled the wand for him. When he hands the wand back to my son to keep playing with it I tell my son to say thank you and he does. The Arab guy then says to my toddler ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome, come give me a hug.‚Äù My innocent child was going to give him the hug when I grabbed his hand and said ‚Äúhe is not allowed to hug strangers, but thank you.‚Äù He kinda rolled his eyes and walked away. Mind you at this point I didn‚Äôt even know he works there but for the rest of our time there he kept walking around us which made me feel super uncomfortable. I just continued to look in the bins while monitoring my son. I wasn‚Äôt too freaked out because my husband was right outside with our daughter.\n\nA few minutes later, someone else who had a vest on and was organizing asked my son for the same toy. At this point, I don‚Äôt know if he just wants to assemble it aswell or what but I let my son hand the guy the toy and I tell him no more playing with that toy. I continue to look in the bins and the Arab guy keeps coming around!\n\nAs I tell my mom I felt uncomfortable and we should start heading to the register to leave my son picked up another already opened toy from the bin and the Arab guy says to me ‚Äúbe careful with your son, he‚Äôs breaking things‚Äù and I checked the toy thinking my son actually broke it but the toy wasn‚Äôt even broken. And I asked the him which toy did my son break? He couldn‚Äôt show me the ‚Äúbroken toy‚Äù but he ‚Äúsaw it on the camara‚Äù. I politely placed all the items we were going to buy back in the bin and grabbed my son and walked out as he said ‚Äúyea, leave‚Äù walked behind us and threw some trash at the bin next to me as we walked passed it.\n\nMy mom instincts, were telling me he was feeling some kind of way because I didn‚Äôt allow my child to hug him but that is weird behavior. He initiated contact with my child, did something nice for him, handed the toy back to him and ASKED HIM FOR A HUG!  I had my son say thank you as a polite child should do but to hug a stranger? Absolutely NOT. Then he complained to me about my child playing with toys saying he was breaking them. In the first place instead of handing him the toy back to continue playing he should have asked me to not let the child touch anything. Which there were other little girls there also playing with toys. But no, he allowed my son to play and when denied a hug he harassed us. Completely unacceptable.\n\nWe as a community cannot allow strangers make our children think it‚Äôs okay to hug a grown man who they don‚Äôt know, simply because he handed them a toy.""},{""reviewer"":""Tony Neto"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""Went there good stuff but the guy ringing people was taking care of 5 people at the same time as me and forgot to give me my bed sheets that were $10 each.

A good number of people in the store for the time of day. The setup reminds me of a Goodwill outlet with the bins holding clothing and random items. However, and thankfully, there is not a push and shove match to get the items as the bins aren‚Äôt replaced every so often like the outlet. Items I found included school supplies,  bedding items, kitchen appliances, lots of jeans, kids toys, and much more. Most items apart from clothes are in their original boxes and look new. Some even have the clearance stickers from where they last were. I was looking for pickleball paddles and found two different sets, so even random scores are possible! Paid $11 for a damaged box that included all the pickleball items. I‚Äôm sure there is a little luck if all items will be in a damaged box but for the price it‚Äôs certainly worth the gamble. I believe the price corresponds to the day but I could be wrong. I‚Äôm also not sure when and how often items are replaced and moved. Regardless it‚Äôs a good place to score a deal. It does take some time to checkout especially if people have a lot of items. However, the cashiers are friendly enough.

Sunday afternoon left me unimpressed. Much of the merchandise that might appeal to most people has been rummaged through and strewn about making it nearly impossible to find all the parts and pieces that came with the torn open packaging. There were the random parts and packaging from probably a dozen hand-held massage devices but not enough to put one complete set together. I did manage to get a good deal on a wide variety of popular brand-name candy for only $1 for each package since it was only 2 weeks after Valentine's Day. Unlike other Amazon and other warehouse surplus outlets, you will NOT find the Great deals I was looking for even if you're first in line Friday morning because those deals are not offered here. A staff member told me that anything of value (over $100) is pulled before it goes to the tables, given a sale price, and kept behind the checkout counter. A large selection of tools (primarily DeWalt, Milwaukee, and Ryobi brands) is visible but you'll need a staff member to hand you anything you might choose to inspect or to find out the price. Even though the store wasn't very busy, I didn't feel comfortable about trying to get more information about anything behind the checkout as there was only one cashier in sight and a steady line of customers wanting to check out. So after finding that prices for the first 2 power tools I asked about were not far from MSRP, I stopped asking. The prices were close enough to Home Depot and Lowe's that I would prefer to pay the higher price, avoid the out of the way location, AND not be stuck with the ALL SALES FINAL policy. I'm still searching for a REAL Amazon liquidation store that sticks to the one price/day model for all merchandise. That is the business model that many liquidators are having success with because their customers are able to find exceptional bargains on high-value merchandise early each week. Attention women and, men who like to make women happy, a large selection of shoes occupies a lot of space but you will have to hunt for your size. I don't think I'll be making this trip again anytime soon. Of note the staff was very friendly, and helpful.

Shopping here is no walk in the park. This is a liquidation business. It is located in a small building that is arranged like a Warehouse. The tables are like deep drop planter tables long and wide with mountains and mountains of all assorted kinds of things. You will be digging for things amongst other people moving about and digging for things. There is a separate area for furniture that is ran by someone.\nYou might want to wear a mask. Some people even had gloves on. You are digging through salvage and drop shipped products.\nThere are carts provided inside. Some people use their carts as line holders as they continue to shop so be aware of that and know that it's a common thing that majority of the shoppers do.\n\nOUR EXPERIENCE:\nWe went literally a week before Christmas on a Tuesday which I thought was 50 cents day but turned out to be 1 day, nonetheless our Haul was good. I felt the need to give a proper review with images and details of our experience as I saw that other people were being harsh in their reviews. You should know what you're going into as I explained it's no walk in the park. I gave it four stars because my mother went into the furniture room and met someone I believe was named Alex who sold her a nice tiny little box ottoman for $5 it was quite a treasure and when we got to the register the lady questioned her about the price and when my mom honestly told her that the gentleman told her $5 someone who I believe may have been one of the owners that were sitting up  by The front adamantly instructed the cashier that the ottoman is 20 dollars. Thankfully the cashier noted how bummed out my mom was about it and she called for the furniture gentleman to come around and he reassured her that he sold her the ottoman for$5. On top of that while we were checking out a gentleman came in from outside hoping to return a product and was literally pushing our stuff aside and arguing with the cashier that the product he bought from this place was faulty. (It was a space heater). The cashier had words with him and when the gentleman refused to move out of the way and continue to push our stuff as she rang it up she told us to keep putting our stuff up we fought entirely uncomfortable and just wanted to get out of there I feel like she should have called the owners over or had someone else step in.\n\nOur Haul:\nAgain as I mentioned we literally went the week before Christmas. We were told all shoes are 5$ bucks regardless what day of the week it is which was still a steal! Some of the things we made out with were;\n-brand name Snow boots for our toddlers for 5$ ea!\n-We even found QUALITY MADE tap shoes!!! You guessed it 5 BUCKS!\n-a littler girl snow/ski overall suit for 1$!!\n-A Harry Potter school girl dress for 1$\n-Quality thermals for the kiddos 1$ ea.\n-baby alive diapers for 1$ that retails for way more at Walmart\n-Multi use trays for the kids. That can be used for eating or play. (Our day care has these trays too!) They took were only 1$ ea!!! And much more.\n\nPlease refer to the photos.\nIn the photos; we paid 5$ for each pair of shoes. 5$ for a small box ottoman man. And everything else was 1$ each item/product. (Even found a jujutsu kiasen book which my niece is into for 1$ which retails for sooooo much more!).""},{""reviewer"":""AK MPM"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Monte Gregg"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Not yet,looking forward!""},{""reviewer"":""Felicia Dees"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Karminia Torres"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Thank you for your business!""},{""reviewer"":""nestor tamayo"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Thank you for your business!""},{""reviewer"":""RA√öL J.

When you fill your bag, you just go to the front area and check out the items that you came across.\n\nI would certainly recommend if you are feeling lucky or just want to browse around.""},{""reviewer"":""Joe Rivest"",""rating"":""2/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""I admit I had unrealistic expectations going in. I thought I might actually find something cool. I went on Sat at 10am when they put out the new inventory for the week, and it's just sad. I estimate that it's 90% home fashion merchandise that is under $30 on Amazon. If you are looking for photo frames or random holiday decor it's ok. The other 10% is made up of random returns, so it could be anything (like car parts for random cars), but for me wasn't worth digging through junk for a couple hours while people threw stuff around looking for treasure. If you like that kind of thing, then this is your place.""},{""reviewer"":""Deborah Gambrell"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""Edited 11 months ago"",""content"":""Enjoyed the $2.00 day first time going it was interesting that my daughter and I found some things that she could use for college""},{""reviewer"":""Sonya Grantz"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""First time here, it's a Tuesday...bins are pretty empty ..of course not much of a selection....maybe better luck next time.

It's a fun way to do shopping, kinda like an action game. I enjoy doing it, But.. Watch out for those workers inside who can ruin the fun mood by falsely accusing for opening the boxes. I have a scanner app on my phone to check what's inside, but don't like when people throwing stuff around, making mess and ignoring constant warnings not to open boxes. Even though, me and my husband were accused of doing that for no reason. Some of their workers was doing something next to us, not even looking at us, and strangely mumbling to herself: \""Please, don't open the boxes\"" and on and on.. I thought- whom she was talking to? I guess she got crazy tired of annoying disobedient people around.. We were digging next to her and came across to some stuff which was open and had been laying there. Then, security guy came over, and this lady began to accuse my husband for opening the box which he didn't open!!! The security guy stood on her side and repeated polite, but loudly that next time my husband would have to leave! He kept reminding and repeating that if we need to look what's inside, we have to go to the table, and ask the guy to open the box for us to look inside. He didn't mention that there's a huge line of people waiting for it and only one guy who was working slow at the table, I guess tired of annoying, but obedient people..  We felt so humiliated! It's like punishing someone publicly so others would feel intimidated. But no! It's in a human sinful nature to brake rules. The more you keep drawing lines, the more they feel tempted to break those rules. Instead of waisting money to pay those extra tired workers, someone should write clear what's inside of those boxes. That security people would have something better to do instead of practicing controlling buyers. I  clearly understand their frustration and respect their work, but something needs to be revised there and changed. Let God give you wisdom. Again, grateful for this business and might stop by again.

My girlfriend and I used to be regulars here‚Äîcoming in after work multiple times a week. We liked the hunt and the atmosphere, but what happened tonight was flat-out unacceptable.\nWe were shopping as usual and went to the bin opening station around 7:35pm. The posted hours clearly say the station closes at 7:45pm. No one was there yet, so we waited. At exactly 7:41pm, a female employee walks up‚Äînot to help us, but to mess around with signs and check her phone every two seconds. Instead of acknowledging us, she grabs a 'station closed' sign and tapes it up while watching the clock tick. The second it hits 7:45, she looks up and finally says, ‚ÄòCan I help you?‚Äô My girlfriend politely asked her to open the boxes she'd been waiting with, and the woman just gives a cold ‚ÄòNo, we closed at 7:45,‚Äô then holds up her phone like we didn‚Äôt know how time works. My girlfriend tried to explain we‚Äôd been there waiting before the cutoff, and the employee literally mutters, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care.‚Äô\nThen, here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîright after blowing her off, this same employee turns to me and sweetly asks if she can help me. Like she‚Äôs talking to a totally different person. I asked her if she could open my boxes, and suddenly she‚Äôs all smiles and says, ‚ÄòSure!‚Äô So I said, ‚ÄòCan you open hers too?‚Äô and she immediately goes cold again and just says ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô\nAt that point, my girlfriend‚Äîwho‚Äôs clearly upset‚Äîtells her she didn‚Äôt need to be rude. And what does the employee do? She walks straight over to a manager and starts pointing at my girlfriend. Like she was the problem. The manager came over, I explained what happened, and thankfully, he was understanding and told us we were good. He even apologized at checkout, which I appreciated. But honestly, the damage was done.\nI ended up putting my stuff back. There‚Äôs no way I was going to let that employee open my boxes after treating my girlfriend like that. That level of disrespect is insane, and honestly, makes you question what kind of people they‚Äôre hiring. We were loyal customers, but after this, I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll be back.

Today we shopped like normal and walked up to the bin opening station around 7:35pm (the sign says it closes at 7:45pm). There was no one there so we patiently waited. I was looking at my phone and noticed that an employee walked up at exactly 7:41pm. Instead of helping my boyfriend and I, she walked around seemingly looking for something. She grabbed the ‚Äúbin opening station closed‚Äù sign and checked her phone, then looked up to the sign that said open until 7:45pm. She then started to make a new sign and put some tape on it, while doing this continuously checking the time on her phone. Right when it turned 7:45pm she looked at me and said ‚Äúcan I help you?‚Äù I asked her nicely if she could open the 3 boxes I had please. And she replied with a flat, ‚ÄúNo, we closed at 7:45pm‚Äù and held up her phone which read 7:45. I still very nicely added that we had been waiting at the station before 7:45pm and to that she still said no and then said under her breath ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù.\n\nWell here‚Äôs the crazy part‚Ä¶ she turns to my boyfriend and asks him nicely ‚Äúcan I help you?‚Äù. He replies and asks if she can open his boxes. To which she cheerfully says, ‚Äúyeah I can!‚Äù. Then he asks, ‚Äúcan you open hers too please?‚Äù And all she said was ‚Äúno.‚Äù\nI then said to her almost in tears that she didn‚Äôt need to be so rude‚Ä¶ (I rarely stick up for myself but I felt the need to say something.) After I said this and my boyfriend put back his items because he didn‚Äôt want her opening them, she immediately went to who I imagine was the manager and started pointing at me.

When we tried to explain we weren‚Äôt ripping anything open and were simply lifting up the tape on a plastic package to check and see if it was what we thought it was (which was 100% something we were intending on and did buy) he tried to make it seem like we ripped it open and took out the product (mind you, the product never left the bag and we would have been able to close the bag back with the tape so nothing was lost from the bag). If it wasn‚Äôt for the things we had found and actually needed, we would have left. Also, the store needs to be more organized.. if you aren‚Äôt going to let people look in boxes or packages, you need to remove the merchandise and put it in bags that people can see through to see the full product or make specific bins labeled for specific genres of products. I would like to state that they do have a box opening station, but that is a hassle when almost everything in the store is in a box. Also, they tell you to scan on Amazon (which a nice young lady was kind enough to show us how to do), but the barcode you scan doesn‚Äôt take you to the correct item.""},{""reviewer"":""sandy west"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""I am so addicted to this place@!!""},{""reviewer"":""Skylar Norton"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""I want to begin by saying this store is great normally however today I received some very negative customer service. I had pulled a box out of its plastic to read and peek inside , which I thought was ok because it had already previously been opened. A tall man came up to me saying ‚Äúno no do not open you can‚Äôt open the box , that‚Äôs why we have a box opening station.‚Äù I replied ‚Äú o ok I didn‚Äôt know because last time I was here I opened boxes that were not labeled and it wasn‚Äôt a problem.‚Äù He then pointed out there were signs with directions on them, however I am nearsighted and  I just thought opening them was ok since most of the items were half way open anyway. He then said I could scan the labels with an Amazon app and I said ok it‚Äôs fine I don‚Äôt need it ( referring to the item I had opened the top of box on) and I was walking away from him at this point because I felt he was being rude and intimidating. So he basically wanted to show me how to scan things when I‚Äôm not in any way mentally challenged and I knew I could figure it out if I wanted to however it was very close to closing time so I didn‚Äôt have time to get schooled on scanning items. So as I‚Äôm walking away and trying to exit the conversation since the man obviously had singled me out to have a power trip on  when i was trying to just go about my business and continue shopping he got mad and said ‚Äú you can just leave‚Äù. This was said as I was walking away from him to continue shopping after I said I did not need the item that I had opened the lid on. So then my mother and I left the store and I did ask him why he was such a jackass on the way out but I felt it was deserved. Customer service has literally went out the window in most places since Covid. I would like to end with stating yes, I was doing something that was incorrect, but there definitely should have been a different way to handle how customers are treated and so that we do not feel intimidated, especially me being a short pregnant woman who was easily intimidated and I felt singled out/ bullied by a tall male who worked at the store. Last note is that when I did open boxes previously in the store I made sure not to damage the items and that they were placed back in the packages even tho most items were completely out of their packaging.I suggest that all of the boxes be labeled because some of them are and some are not to deter this problem from re arising.""},{""reviewer"":""Jason Garcia"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""$1 day isn‚Äôt anything but junk they just want you to clean the bins for them.

The rules are simple, no opening boxes or packages over the bins.

One of the workers taping up boxes in the bins was rude and talked rudely regarding her disapproval of some of the customers to other customers, all while the Christian music played over the speakers... Typical.\n\nAs far as items go, many of the items in the bins were not worth the cost they were marked at, and so many of the items were in unmarked boxes that you're not allowed to open unless you take it to the counter for them to open. Do you know how much time I'd be wasting waiting in line at the counter to open up every unmarked box just so I know what the contents are inside!? It felt like that rude worker was scouring the room waiting for some one to even slightly lift a partially opened box so she could go all Karen on them.

I've been there several times and had a horrible experience every single time. From the owner being extremely hateful to her employees right out in front of all the customers, to the employees being hateful to customers because the owner is forcing them to be that way. I kept giving them a chance thinking it was just the pressure of being newly opened up, but it continues to be the same way every time.\nThe very first time hurt my heart so bad. There was going to be a drawing for a prize. The way you got your name in the drawing was by spending $100. We were checking out and the total was $84. The cashier let us know if we spent $16 more, then we could enter into the drawing. So we went ahead and checked out for the $100 and then went to get 16 more items to be 100 and so that the next person in line didn't have to wait on us. The owner raised her voice and had a VERY nasty tone with the employee that UPSOLD for her! She brought in more money and got repremanded for it! I haven't seen her there since then.

It is insane. Love it!!!!!""},{""reviewer"":""Martie Glenn"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Buyer beware! Let me tell you the reasons I state this place is using unethical, deceptive tactics. This week I went for the second time. The first visit was a month ago. I recognized immediately they are selling returned items, most from Amazon. I used to work for Amazon warehouse and know that returns are not looked at up to a designated value and are thrown into a box. They are 95% broken, damaged, or missing pieces. They sell them to consumers as \""mystery boxes\"" for cheap. Dig & Find is trying to resell these returns as \""new\"" to make a buck off you. I asked about the daily $ costs and she explained everything is new on a weekly basis and that is why by Thursday the inventory is gone and replenished with new. I saw 5 specific items that were still there from over a month ago. That was lie #1. They had several health and beauty products on the table to the right as you enter and they were expired. Yes expired over 6-9 months ago! That is NOT new. Who would buy expired vitamins for example for $7 when you can simply go in Amazon or Walmart and buy fresh for half that price?? Lie #2. This week the sales lady approached me and sorta snotty told me to take the package over to the opening table (pointed across room) and said open it there then tape it back up when finished. I asked why when it was already opened as they are unmarked and the buyer can't see what is inside? Ridiculous!! Waste of time and tape as the next buyer will open the package to see what the item is. Inspect always!! All 5 packages were missing parts or damaged item inside. Plus they were already left open. None of the items were of greater value than if you purchased directly from Amazon in new condition. Very deceptive behavior at this store. It's important for the consumer to express these unethical business practices or it will continue to scam other people who aren't savvy buyers. If they were smart, they would repackage items into clear plastic bags and list as is with prices marked. Don't let them take advantage of you!!\n\nIn response to reply. I'm 100% truthful and honest. We were told items NEW and the reasons I pointed out disclaim that. I was not embarrassed as the packages were already open. LOL The sales lady lied on both instances. By the way, people can purchase mystery boxes on their own for $25-50 each depending on size. Yes, if you go to your store in a wed or Thur it may be worth it but you don't get rid of unsold items in a weekly basis as the lady told me. She did lie! Just the fact you replied in a rude manner and not taking accountability for this. I'm not hurting your business with truthful experiences posted, unless you are lieing too. Some people in this world don't celebrate Christmas too. Happy Hanukkah! Plus I provided suggestions to improve your business.""},{""reviewer"":""Sally Rice"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""This place is unbelievable unreal.

Today I was over there and thought I would see if they had anything that I could use, I was directly told by a staff member to not open a box that they would do it for me, Well first of all I don't open your boxes, I don't tear your product boxes and I don't break your products, I am probably one of the very few customer's that you have that doesn't, That being said I do not half to deal with any of your staff members implying or making a statement toward me as a customer when it is not true, If your\n\nstaff members want to be a accuser or imply or make a statement directly toward a customer they need to know what they are talking about first before being rude, I will not deal with your staff making false accusations toward me as a customer, Sadly you have loss me as a customer today and I normally try to stop in your business a few times a week, I wont deal with any rudeness from any business that I give my money to I will go else where to a business that appreciates me as a customer and appreciates my money that I give to them as a customer, Word of advice to you as a business, Don't be rude to your customers because you need us\n\nas a business for profit to keep your doors open, It isn't the other way around. I have many friends in Crossville TN, In Fairfield Glade Community as well as Clark range TN that also feel the same way that I do, This is no reflection on the two gentlemen that own this business they are both nice guys and are friendly but the staff that they have need replaced, Because the staff they have now make the atmosphere feel non friendly to the customer and or customer's in the store and that is a problem period as far as I am concerned because this is suppose to be a family and friendly business open to the public here in Crossville TN.""},{""reviewer"":""Kristy Smith"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""Edited 2 years ago"",""content"":""I had a blast!

Sometimes an item has leaked/spilled a mysterious substance over many products.

Then as I walked along the back wall, I got another blast of a strong cigarette smell. By the time I left, I was nauseous from smelling the smoke. I visited again yesterday, and now the entire store smells very strongly of cigarette smoke from the time you approach the open doors, even though no one was actively smoking.\n\nSince I have such a strong sensitivity bordering on allergy to the smoke, I won't be visiting any more.

Their variety, from Shark vacuums that I've bought and still use, to parts for my PC build, is impressive.\n\nTheir live Facebook updates make shopping exciting and convenient. The heart of the store is its team - Oli, Chris, and Bj - who provide outstanding customer service, making each visit special.\n\nWhat I especially appreciate are the practical features like the testing station for electronics and the reassuring 5-day return policy.

This place is mostly a huge selection of <4\"" knives/multi-tools, massive selection of corporate furniture and pawn-shop sized sections of power tools, toy guns, apparel, 'gift shop' style items, electronics, and household items.\n\nIt's a mostly static, predictable inventory of well-used and/or dated items that belonged in an industrial setting or to the people in those settings. Plus the occasional out-of-place gem. But primarily, you should expect 10+yr old work-provided stuff that cops or gov't staff parted with. Perk being - sometimes we forget what types of jobs can be gov't jobs.\n\nGem example: today I saw one someone snag one those gas station style 3 foot cylindrical mountain dew refridgerators on wheels! Also saw a 10ft tall industrial double oven, restaurant booth seats, digital and polaroid cameras, tiny portable scanners/printers, huge plotter, and a dozen or so circa 2013 monitors for what I'd call garage sale prices. This place is a 90's stationary heaven, but impractical to a modern minimalist. I left empty handed, yet the experience of exploring the inventory was so unique that I had fun digging through boxes for over an hour.\n\nI recommend a trip here to any frugal brick and morter business owner.

Plus they are open on Thursday when all the others are closed. I think it is locally owned unlike the other bin stores.

Yanking fights over items and packages. People get all in your space. The Restock tables comes out 30 minutes after they open and everyone stands around on a red line. When they sound the alarm its madness! Restock tables are a fighting pit!\nRemember these are online returned items being resold by the palettes from many different companies. We saw them unloading a box truck on Thursday while at the dollar general.\nIf you're not down for that type of craziness, go on the other days. The setting is calmer. You have more space to dig through table bins.\nIf you have a question of what's in a box or in a package you take it to the front and there is an \""open package\"" table.

At the old Ollies location. On 9/28/24, I had time to visit the location. Well I was surprise lots and lots of stock total square footage used and some of the back area too. Here is what I saw and observed.\n\nPros: Lots of stock all areas, Clothes, Cosmetics, Toys, Electronics, and much more. You need to dig\nand look hard to fine the good stuff and prices. But expect that at this type of store. Lots of buys from Amazon, Box Stores, and buys from overseas manufactures. I found Commanders cap for $6, but it was a wool blend which is a good buy. 3M hooks for $5, which is $13 elsewhere. A $5 dollar bag for a mini chainsaw to store. Best deal was Sony wireless open end headphones for $4. Anything Sony is expensive so grab it. This is what I found after about 2 hours of walking the store and shopping hard. Another thing that shows the store has adapted with the times was, they had an Amazon area with open pallets of Amazon returns for $5 a box or large envelope. Can not open just shake the package and take a chance. If I had more time I might of taken a chance on a few of them. Many of them felt and sounded like clothes.\n\nCons: The layout of the store is hard to shop and takes time. Because of this you need time to shop and kids may have problems with that. The merchandising has many of the same items in 3 different locations thru out the store. Many sku's were like this. Another issue had the same items with different prices. One area $1 another area same item $4. Many items like that. Many items everywhere not priced which got old after a while. And items that had prices were over priced. Compared to other stores in the area.\n\nIn conclusion, its worth the trip to visit, give yourself a lot of time. Look at the prices, check dates of the food, and cosmetics. Over the years I have seen many stores like this come and go. This store has a lot of junk inventory and lack of merchandising. Hopefully the owner/buyer gets a handle of not buying too much broken or open stock. Again its worth the trip, give yourself time, and then not visit again for a few months. Cause I don't see a lot of this stock turning that fast in this economy and higher prices.""},{""reviewer"":""Mohammad Chaudry"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""9 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Elaina"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""10 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Mary Dal-Favero"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""10 months ago"",""content"":""Very busy.
