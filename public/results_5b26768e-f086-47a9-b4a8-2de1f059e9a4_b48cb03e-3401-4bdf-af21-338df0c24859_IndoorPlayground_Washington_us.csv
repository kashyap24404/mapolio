Review: Cute boutique play club for young children. Ideal 6mo-5yr age ranges. There's a little separate area for babies and the rest of the space is free play for other young children. It is kept very clean and organized throughout the day. I appreciate that there is something like this in walla walla to allow kids to play when it's too cold or too hot outside, which is seemingly 10 months out of the year. They offer various membership options to fit any preference of frequency of facility use and there are options for renting out for parties and other events are hosted by owners here for members. Overall a great small business that I hope thrives in our town!

Review: Absolutely love Evergreen play club! I have 4 kiddos from age 5, 7, 10 and 12 and took them all this weekend to check out their grand opening event. They all spent over 3 hours playing and being creative. So many things to do from puzzles and building to scooters and climbing. They cannot wait to go back! They even have iced coffees to purchase for us tired mommas!

Review: As a restaurant owner, I am not typically one to leave bad reviews—but I absolutely have to address something that happened today. I purchased a $16 cheese and fruit plate that was full of old/bruised fruit. I kindly asked if they could remake the plate because my children have sensory issues and wouldn’t eat the fruit. When they remade it, they gave us less than HALF the food that was on the original plate. When I asked them where the rest of the cheese was, they said “the cheese assortment is at random, that’s just how we do it.” It was insanely busy and I didn’t want to cause any delays for other families, but I am SO disappointed. They served me slivers of apple peels on the second plate, FOUR crackers, and a small pile of Swiss cheese that my children obviously wouldn’t eat. I feel like they did this deliberately, as the employees looked annoyed I even brought the plate to their attention. For $16, food should be fresh and stored properly to avoid bruising and spoiling. They would not give me a refund. Though my kids love this place, I don’t think we’ll be visiting again because of the blatant disrespect. I spend hundreds of dollars here a month, so I expected a little more kindness and care. The first photo is what they initially served me, and the second photo is what the replacement plate had on it.

Review: This place is a great place for parents to hang out with other parents, and kids to hang out with other kids. Reminds me of old McDonald's play pits, just big enough for adults to climb in with their younger children to help them down bigger slides. They have really cheap coffee. Not so cheap beer and junk food snacks which are okay. Honestly, the best part about this place is how tired it makes my kid so that he goes to bed easy at night.

Review: I could not believe the state of the womens bathroom! Disgusting! The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in months, the toilet seat cover holder was pulled off the wall and laying on the floor, toilets were stained with urine, trash and filth everywhere, no trash bag in the trash can! The health department needs to be called. I would not allow my child to use this restroom. We left immediately. Get your shit together and hire enough staff to clean! Bathrooms should be checked every 30 mins. Wish I had taken a photo but I could not get out of there fast enough. Gross.

Review: This place was so much fun! The price was quite fair, I  spent two hours playing with my kiddo in the tower. There were other adults playing with their kids in there too. A good time was had by all. The staff do their best to maintain it, and we overheard some of them complain they didn’t have the right dusters to get some of the tops of the slides despite their best efforts. They did their best to keep it clean and tidy. The lattes were good, and staff were friendly and courteous.

Review: Very large indoor playground for kids. Play structure has four levels which is excellent. Coffee or beer/wine for adults as needed :) reasonably costly - $21? for two kids.

One bizarre thing in a play center for kids under 3: no changing table or bin in men's toilets. Guess changing diapers is something only women do

Review: This place is ideal for playdates, but the cement floor by the tables is a concern. Children tend to slip and fall while walking or running to get a drink, particularly since they often don't wear shoes when quickly grabbing water. I've witnessed numerous slips and falls. It would be great if they installed a floor more suitable for kids. The staff is extremely friendly.

Review: They treat customers differently. We were told 15 min set up prior, then at 1:45 they were rushing us out of the room, saying it was booked, no one showed for 2 hours after, the next door room was in  30 min early setting up, and was still in 20 min after our time were supposed to be out buy. They charged us for graffiti balloons and never said anything about it, they gave us flack as kids didnt go in the play area as most of them were under 3 yrs old. Customer services was bad. Grandson 1st bday, the guy didn't even know how to cut a cake, as we were not allowed to touch knifes. Then he left it on the table.

Review: The staff was friendly enough but it’s super dirty in the play structure, piles of trash between the climbing areas and exposed sharp zip ties all over the places where kids slide and play. It’s VERY dark inside the structure which makes it hard to see when kids are coming and going- an accident waiting to happen.

Be warned- in the toddler area, the netting above is connected to the big kids play area- when they run overhead the netting sags and can super easily lead to a kids full weight slamming down onto your head.

This place is not worth breaking your neck over

That said- my little one had fun

Review: The indoor play place is great for kids, a little pricey for what it is.
However, the food... The food is GROSS. I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar wrap. Brown lettuce, squishy wilted tomatoes, and the chicken was clearly precooked and bought that way. They're going to make someone sick!
The pizza was ok, very greasy. My kids did not eat very much.
I would go back for the play area but I won't eat there again.

Update: We booked a birthday party here and it went great. They had run of out invites when we stopped by and I don't think anyone reached out to us about the food order like the email said but I might've just missed the call. It wasn't a big deal. I was able to place the food order a few days before and we didn't run into any problems with that. The host was very friendly and attentive. All of the kids had a blast. We will probably do a birthday party here again next year if that's what our kid wants to do.

Review: This is a good place for kids, I guess. My child is autistic and he is tempted to play there. Never plays longer than 10 min. Minimum pay stated on the card $10.50. Counter is closed and you have to walk to their cafeteria to pay. My request to pay for 30 minutes rejected. Been asked to pay $11.42 with explanation that price is raised. Weird amount. Always paid rounded number before. I assumed that caused by my ""stupid"" request. Of course I will go again and pay $15, 20, 30 so on because my son wants to play 5-10 minutes and it is some fun gor him.  Five stars for a good idea and place minus two stars for suspicious pricing and ""rude"" redirection on the empty counter.

Review: No WIFI. When I messaged them asking why, no response. Seems silly for a place like this not to have some connectivity for parents who are hanging out while kids play.

Otherwise, they have laser tag every last Friday of the month - unless a private party reserves that laser tag session, then everyone else is out of luck. Problem is, there's no way to know until you get there.

This happened to us last week (kiddo was heartbroken), at which time we were lied to and told there will be another laser tag session the following week. I mean, why lie?

Food is mediocre at best. Staff isn't all that friendly (though I wouldn't expect teenagers working in that environment would be).

Definitely won't be going back.

Review: Let me start by saying that I will never come here again.
You can always choose where to sit—on the old sofa or at the scratched tables.
And my child found a bunch of trash on the yellow slide.
No one ever repairs anything in this place. And nothing ever gets cleaned.
I sat the whole time just waiting to leave, afraid that something might fall from the ceiling onto my head. There was dust and cobwebs absolutely everywhere.
I will never come here again.
Children should not play in such a place; it is not hygienic. awful and dirty place.

Review: Fun place for my kid. Enjoyed the experience. Family member ordered cheese and pepperoni pizza. We were given just cheese with no pepperoni. We politely informed the person who brought our food out who responded with, “No, you ordered cheese pizza, you don’t get pepperoni.” This seemed odd so we reaffirmed it was the wrong order, to which the reply was, “Too bad, you ordered wrong, it’s not my fault.”

I understand it being busy and overworked, but this was a very rude and cold interaction that put a bad taste over the entire rest of our experience. I’m not sure we’ll come back, and we will definitely demand a receipt for everything we order from here from now on.

Review: Fun spot to let the kiddos get out that energy! Less than $10 for toddlers and parents being free is more than a fair bargain considering the scale of the play areas. Pictures don't do it justice! Suitable for parents too if you wanna hangout with your little ones on their adventures. Cafe is great as well, not too pricey and plenty of coffee to choose from, thank goodness!

Review: I booked my daughter's 6th birthday here. Before arrival we stopped at Fred Meyers and grabbed a veggie tray and meat & cheese platter, for a total of about $22. Upon arrival the host told me I couldn't bring the food in. My husband had dropped us off to go grab one more thing. I took the closed packages into the party room until his return.The host went and got two more employees and they proceeded to stare at me thru the window and point at me. When I walked out they rudely reminded me to remove the unopen food and I could purchase snacks through them. My husband hadn't returned, so I couldn't remove the food yet. I checked the menu for snack for our guest and realized I'd be spending over $70 for the same food in smaller portions. I went in the toy structure with my daughter, and there was duct tape everywhere. Completely unmaintained and dust everywhere outside of where the kids were playing.After cake my husband cut his thumb fairly deep while cleaning the knife, it was bleeding through napkins & dripping down his arm. We asked to use a first aid kit & the host brought us a small bandaid. We had to leave with his finger wrapped in bloody napkins. Online the party package was $250, & I paid a $50 deposit. At checkout they charged my card another $250. We only had 8 children attend the party. We use to regularly go enjoy the indoor park during our wet NW weather, but I will never return to this business. I will not be surprised if they shut down soon. 100% do not recommend.

It’s the perfect way to kill a couple of hours if the weather is bad. It’s a lot quieter than similar indoor play areas. The staff are always incredibly kind to us. They must treat their staff well because there’s always a couple of staple staff members here! The food is so yummy as well!

Review: Great location and low prices. Other than that this place is filthy and covered in duct tape. I was the first one here (they unlocked the door for me). It was clear the structure had not been cleaned and sanitized the night before or this morning. I saw pepperonis on the floor between the rows of cannons. I found sunglasses at the bottom of the blue slides. Simple things the workers would have seen if they even did a walkthrough. I would gladly pay more if it meant they were replacing the damaged areas and staffing someone to keep it clean.

Then when you call to let them know, and ask them what they will be doing about it all they say is they will let their manager know.. that’s not the answer I was looking for. Don’t risk it!!

Review: I've been here countless times, and have had multiple birthdays here. Overall, its been a fair experience for what it is. This most recent visit was a disappointment, and will likely be my last.

I brought in my son to play, and my triplets have to come with us and sit. The guy at the door said he had to charge us, because they are now 1. I explained to them they are feeding tubes, disabled, and won't be doing anything beyond sitting in there stroller likely asleep. With a straight face he still said we had to pay for them regardless. I told him we're just going to leave, and he reluctantly said okay if they are just going to be sitting there then we can go in. I only stayed to not disappoint my son who was excited to come. Rules are rules, which is fine, but I'll pass in the future if I can't bring along my disabled kids who would just be sitting there seats.

Review: For the price I paid for two kids to play (over 30 dollars) I would have expected some of the money to go to fixing their playground. Multiple holes in the netting, and many areas that are just not safe for children. Part of it is literally held together with zip ties, and quite badly. Everything is extremely overpriced, so I’m curious, where does the money go? Fix your establishment! You can still charge your 20 dollars for a little Caesar’s pizza, just put some money toward fixing the place rather than lining your pocket.

Review: We’ve been coming to Dizzy Castle for about three years. After the birthday party we just had there, I can tell you that I will never bring my children here or recommend it to anyone. After an incident in the play structure with my two year old, I brought it to a staff’s attention. Zero follow up or follow through. While up in the structure was so many children with almost zero supervision. While my kids were actively going down slides other kids would jump on top of them to go down. Many kids hung from above the slides and were literally kicking kids as they slid down. You look around there is no real adult supervision. The staff are literally a group of mainly teenage girls. No real oversight and don’t even get me started with the repairs. When we just went there was a literally hole in the bridge. Mind you, I’ve brought this to the staffs attention and you can see where someone attempted to zip tie it together but the hole has continued to grow. Like at what point do you wait for a repair? Until a child is injured? Never again will I bring my children or anyone I know here.

Review: Had my son’s birthday party there yesterday.  There was  the employee oversight of the children playing in the play structure was minimal at best from what I observed. Parents were also not being held accountable to pay attention to their own children, Which caused a lot of rule breaking and uncomfortable and upsetting situations for younger children who were just getting bulldozed over by larger children. Other parents need to be way more attentive instead of tucked away in their phones and laptops. All the employees were really nice to us but also seemed overwhelmed. The play structure itself appears to be falling apart In certain places and it seems they were patched together with zip ties. Yikes.  We have been here several times and this was the worst I have seen it here.

Review: My 2.5 year old really enjoys coming here. However if you're there at their busier times it is chaos and VERY hectic. Bigger kids running around really fast (which I understand!) If you have a kiddo that is sensitive to to much noise or people I'd recommend going during their slower hours. They have a small baby/toddler area that's nice. It's not super exciting but it's nice that they have it.
I will also say - their big slides are INSANELY fast. So fast that I feel like should warning signs posted next to them. My son is a toddler, 2.5 years old, and I always sit behind him when we go down the slide. However last time he started sliding 2 seconds before me so he essentially went down the slide by himself. He started going SO fast that he caught air after one of the little bumps and landed on his back/smacked his head on the slide :( we left after that. So just beware, if you have toddlers I do not recommend them going down the slide alone!!

On the bright side, they have numerous party rooms decorated with various themes, adding to the excitement. We spent half a day here and had an absolute blast.

They have spots for families to have a snack/lunch, massage chairs for the adults and LOTZ of bouncy castles and areas for the littlest to play. The newest edition is a cool area with a ball pit, slide, mini trampoline and areas to climb. The only thing is, the ball pit needs more balls bc its a hard landing from the slide. Hope you guys can fix this! Very nice staff and they encourage moms/dads to play too :)

Review: Just one bad thing to say. I took my three kids here to play 8, 12, 13 all well behaved kids my wife signed the waiver prior ( long time ago and my wife was not with me) I had no clue that an 18 year or older had to stay and supervise them so I just wanted to walk around the mall for a minute and come back I didn't even get a quarter way through the mall and my oldest daughter texted me and said they got kicked out because a parent was not there they did not wait until I got there before they kicked him out they were standing outside they did not give us a second chance just kicked them out within 10 minutes of playing I just think that sence I didn't know we should have gotten a chance to come back and play people know how much this place costs with 3 kids and only 10 minutes to play what is this world coming to.

Review: My family has been going to this place since it opened. This has always been a fun place until recently.  My 10 yo daughter and seven year old autistic son came to me upset and visibly shaken, when I asked what was wrong they said the worker yelled at them to get off a jumping item, I asked my kids why and they had no idea. So when I went to ask the worker she states my kids were not following the rules and stated she told them the rules. I looked at my kids and knew they had no clue. I then asked the worker to please explain the rules to me with my kids there so I knew the rules as well as my kids. ( most mothers do this so when later when  I can remind them before playing.)  instead she just repeated I already told them, over and over. I asked I want to know the rules so I can explain them to my son again later. She refused to and just argued. We decided to leave and will not be back. We will travel to Vancouver or Olympia for our jump houses. Sad the owners were so friendly and staff up until this last year. Keisha the worker needs to learn patience and grace when dealing with children. After a long talk with my kids they said she never said anything to them about rules only yelled at them to get off. Again thank you Keisha for giving my children a negative experience at one of their favorite places.

Response to owners comment

I asked what the rules were of the bounce house in question. Not at any moment did any of the three workers show me the posted rules or that they are online after being asked multiple times. I did not sign a waiver so I was not aware. As a mother that use to go frequently, I walked with my kids and supervised them. The younger girls that worked there before walked around were constantly cleaning the mats and items. I have never seen any of the current staff do this. Typically the gentleman is seen walking around,  the other two ladies are usually sitting talking or on their phones…the customer service has went down hill. They are the face of your company.

Review: We've been coming to the Family Room since it opened and have always loved it. The variety of fun activities was amazing and staff was top notch. It was a desperately needed, indoor play area for this area!
Went there today and I was really sad to see what's left of it. So many of the items that were there, are now gone... And what's left is getting pretty run down. My son was bored within 15 minutes and we left.
We really hope it doesn't continue this way... and we'd love to see some improvements, even if that means paying more to play there.

Review: It was my grandsons 5th birthday. The kids all had a blast in the bounce houses and slides. We cheered one youngster on as he made the leap from one big red ball to another. After a face first slide into the pit  worthy of wipeout, he was very determined to get all the way across. The staff is very nice and the room plenty large enough. The only downside was having to clean up, which all and all was much easier than cleaning the hostess' house twice.

Review: We had a planned party and learned something from the experience: We arrived early to set up and had to wait until after our alloted time to be allowed to enter the den. We had been told we were allowed 15 minutes to set up. We were late getting out as we had thought we were still allowed the 60 minutes. It resulted in just over $54.00 in charges. Ill save you some money on your party - do it elsewhere and just bring the kids in to play - you dont get the 60 minutes you pay over $200 for. Just some free advertising.

*Edit following owner response: Now I know why we got the car seat delivered to our party that belonged to the next one and had to deal with her complaints about us taking her stuff. I wish I could say that we were mad about what you believe we were. As local business owners ourselves - it wasnt on our radar until we were still sitting at the octagonal table after our party started. Cameras have time stamps. I acknowledged that we were in fact late departing, but your staff was unloading the following party after we had departed.

Review: We had our daughters 7th birthday here, they said that the room wasn’t ready and they would come and get us when it was, we ended up with people for the party arriving on time and we still weren’t in the room. Wound up getting asked to leave on time which pissed both my husband and me off due to the fact we had no set up time and it ran into our party time. We got charged an additional amount because we took too long to tear down. Overall not happy with the experience. While my kids love this place I do not plan on booking it for birthdays anymore due to this experience.

Review: IF YOUR KID LIKE TO PLAY THE “FLOR IS LAVE” THEY WILL LOVE IT. We liked this place as parents too. Found that it was somewhat affordable in comparison to say, Dizzy Castle in Vancouver. The kids enjoyed it, and stayed very active the entire time. Food offerings are limited, and there’s no beer or wine for the adults which is often overlooked at these okay places. More modern options elsewhere make
Sure there’s libations for parents who will be sitting there for hours as their kids play. The bouncy houses were surprisingly quite! I’ve been to other indoor bouncy house places that were unbearably loud. We will be back. Note: adults must be present and you can’t just drop your kid and walk the mall or go to Planet Fitness

His wife or sister or whoever was with him started screaming and causing a scene so I yelled back. Then all of a sudden the manager comes and asks me to leave.

He likes exploring all the different rooms, but his favorites are definitely the car room and the new ball pit they recently added.

The owners are super friendly and welcoming, and their kids (who are often around) are just as sweet my son loves playing with them. The space is always really clean, which I appreciate as a parent.

I’m so glad a place like this opened up nearby. It’s not easy finding fun, toddler-friendly spots, but this one is a gem!

Review: New to Puyallup! I’ve been looking for indoor spaces to take my toddler. I found this place via Instagram! Our experience was just ok. I felt as if everything at that place I have at home already. It wasn’t busy but we came in the afternoon on a Thursday.

The pros:
• Super Clean and Tidy
• Nice selection of toys
• Owner is friendly
• One time waver upon registration
• Nice activity for a rainy day
• Great for smaller aged children

The Cons:
• There were renovations actively happening during visit. Ladders, tools, etc.,
• Back office door remained open.
• Loose bolts on some of the equipment. (Saw some children walking around with bolts. Were taken away.)
• No clearly marked area to nurse as an option.
• No music

I truly felt welcomed and this place is pretty new so I’m sure there will be more additions and improvements a year from now. Those are just my initial observations.

Review: I brought my 2 year old son here today. He is a very sensory seeking kiddo and loves to run around explore and try everything, this playground was wonderful he got to play with a variety of toys with different themes. He enjoyed the blue room full of trains and cars and action figures it was his favorite. And the bouncy house was a big hit.
I loved that each room had a different style of play music, dolls and babies, cars and trains, jungle gym and dinosaurs!
The staff was friendly and the rooms and toys were clean and safe. We will definitely return 😊

It’s perfect for kids to run around, explore, and just have fun. There are plenty of activities to keep them entertained, from slides to music room to ride the cars and everything felt really safe.

Review: Very cool place with a lot of neat toys, staff told me this was the third week they’ve been open. It’s very clean and the price is good. I personally think the themed rooms need a bit more work on the toys they offer. Like the car room has this neat Mario electric race track, but doesn’t quite work right all the time. My kiddo got bored of it pretty quick but still went back to it. It’d be nice to have more open ended toys. Maybe some small wooden blocks to build with and the wooden classic train tracks in the car room. It’d be nice to see some picture labels on walls and buckets where the toys are supposed to go to encourage clean up skills.

But that’s my opinion, overall I like the different rooms. There’s a lot to do to keep kids occupied. I will come back again

We played Legos, arcade, puzzles, race cars, Barbies, and even Power Wheels. The owner was super friendly and accommodating, and it was just an overall lovely experience. So glad we decided to pop in, and we will be coming back!

Reasonablely priced at $13.50 w/card or $13 cash for 2 hours of playtime your baby/toddler/young child can play in their themed rooms. Great place for the kiddos to socialize and explore. You can bring your own snacks or pay for what they have there, the place looks and is consistently kept clean. The playspace after you check in is a no-shoes zone, so socks are a must. Will absolutely come back with my little ones, they had a great time

There were different activities that they could do, ranging from a kids kitchen area, a princess room, a dinosaur area and more! They had some electric toys that they could ride around on, and when the batteries died they inflated a bouncy house. Just a great time for the kids. We were thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness as well. One room would be empty, and the staff would be right behind sanitizing every toy and touchable surface. I could not recommend this place more. Please support small business, this place rocks!

Review: We love coming here. It is a great space for our 2 year old to play with other kids while we have a coffee. The only suggestion is that we wish they would get new toys in occasionally. We have been coming for almost a year now (about 2x a month) and it seems to be the same toys. I think it would really keep people coming in and kids more interested if they would rotate new toys every now and then.

** Upated review 2 weeks later.  Thank you for listening to my review! We came back last week and saw many new toys, and our son loved it and had a great time. We appreciate you being on top of it and listening to your customers, I updated the review to 5 stars, and will continue to come enjoy the café!

Both employees were busy making food and cashiering.  The focus needs to be shifted to the child's experience, not the adult's food and beverages.  Hire an employee dedicated to walk around and put back scattered toys.

Review: I recently visited PlayCafe with my two young children, and I have to say, it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. Owners Matt and Michelle have truly created a haven that perfectly caters to both children and their parents.

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that Matt and Michelle understand the unique needs of young families. The play area is incredibly well-designed, with a variety of safe, engaging activities that kept my kids entertained for hours. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully arranged to spark imagination and encourage active play, from the colorful climbing structures to the creative play stations.

What truly sets PlayCafe apart, though, is how well they accommodate parents. The seating area is comfortable and strategically placed so that you can keep an eye on your little ones while enjoying a well-deserved break. The café offers a great selection of refreshments, from freshly brewed coffee to healthy snacks, making it easy to relax and refuel.

Moreover, the entire facility is impeccably clean and well-maintained, which is a testament to the care and dedication Matt and Michelle put into their business. They are always on hand to greet you with a warm smile and are genuinely invested in ensuring that every family has a positive experience.

In a world where finding a place that both children and parents can enjoy equally is rare, PlayCafe stands out as a true gem. It's clear that Matt and Michelle have poured their hearts into creating a space that understands and meets the needs of families. I highly recommend PlayCafe to anyone looking for an all-around great place for kids to play and parents to relax. We will definitely be returning soon!

My only complaint is that their food options for kids are really dairy-heavy and light on whole foods, and they don't allow outside food. My son doesn't really eat anything they offer, which limits the amount of time and money we spend when we visit.

Review: We did the DIY party package for my daughters birthday. We arrive 30min before the party to set up the decorations. We weren’t allowed to really help any (for liability reason) but this also put a restraint on the party starting at 4. Only the birthday girl was allowed in the play area until everyone could get checked in. Other kids weren’t allowed in until maybe 15 or 20 minutes past 4 (my paid time) due to decorations needing to be put up first. If this was the case I would say 2 workers should have been available rather than 1. I feel it took away from my paid time from the party, especially since the play area closes 30min before the due time (4-6) for clean up. That’s understandable, but not allowing other kids in until check in past the party start time was my only complaint. Other than that, the kids had a blast.

The drop-in pricing is fair, and there are several membership or punchcard options for even more savings.
We homeschool and I’m very excited to be able to bring my older son and work one-on-one with him while the younger kiddos are engaged in play close by.
Also, they are testing out staying open until 8pm on Friday nights. We popped back in with dad in the evening for a local beer and some more play time, did not disappoint!

We came so that our son can play not to eat off of a super limited menu mostly consisting of basic sandwiches and children’s food. There are 8 restaurants within walking distance and we would’ve happily stayed longer had I been able to go get food and bring it in. In other words eat before you arrive but they do have lots of options for young children

Review: We really wanted to like this place. My 7 and 2 year olds both had a lot of fun, but my 11 year old was left out of the fun. They have a 10 and under only rule, according to the rude staff ""because big kids get too rowdy"".  The big play structure was very cool, but had some routing issues that my 2 year old couldn't find the small slides easily. Unfortunately, the structure and the inflatables were all quite dusty, and the inflatables had some tears and holes in them. The snacks, drinks and fee for play were all reasonably priced, though.

Review: 4 year old daughter walked through a puddle of piss on the big “non-inflatable” structure. Kids dad doing god knows what on his phone. I walk up to the main counter to get new, clean socks for my daughter. I tell the young woman working, some older guy who dresses like a kid was sitting behind her on the computer. I say “I need to buy a pair of socks, my daughter just walked through another kids pee”. The staff reply “okay if you’re paying with card you need to get something else because the minimum purchase is $2 and the socks are $1”. Not a word about the puddle of piss from either the guy at the computer or the young employee. So I get a bag of Doritos as well. I proceed to help my daughter change and go back into the play area, and I need to direct her to avoid the still present puddle of piss. The young employee comes out to tell me that I need to get the unopened bag of Doritos out of the play area. My reaction is, you care about this unopened bag of chips that I had to buy just to get my daughter clean socks, but not the piss 10 kids are running through? I honestly didn’t even realize I was holding the unopened bag of chips that I had to buy because I was focused on the situation at hand. She did come and clean it but it was way, way too late. The guy, behind the counter probably should’ve stepped in, the girl employee is young but he’s old enough to know better. If you like your kids walking through disgusting toys, this is your spot.

3/25/25 update: in response to the owner implying that I did not mention the puddle of piss, perhaps your staff could use a hearing evaluation. I 100% stated that I needed new socks because my kid ran through a puddle of piss, I have absolutely no reason to lie about this. It’s certainly not my fault your staff chose not to clarify if they didn’t hear me, because they certainly heard the second part of my sentence saying that we needed the socks. Why aren’t there staff on the play floor watching at all time anyways? This is something that parents should not have to report, full stop. Take accountability owner. PS the tops of your toys are also all caked in dust, how long could that possibly take to clean?

Kids got to jump for an hour before having their own large room to open gifts, & have cake and pizza. The couches in the jumping area for parents are comfortable & there are cafe drinks available, too.
The one entrance/exit & baby gate were also great anxiety reducers for safety concerns.

Review: My child has a great time here! It’s a little pricey but worth it for a fun inside activity every few months. The only downside today was that I had to buy socks as an adult even though I wasn’t going in or on any of the equipment while there was a family there where none of them, kids included, were wearing socks which is against the posted rules in numerous places. I don’t mind buying socks (only $1 and they have tacos on them!), but either make everybody follow the rules or else get rid of the rules.

Review: Our kids enjoyed playing here, it is great for older kids but we have major concerns about the safety of Jump For Joy for small children. A few of the things we noted:

As with anywhere and any situation parents should be watching their own children but unfortunately not all parents do. We watched kids go behind the jump castles and saw one of the air pumps in a space that was easily accessible. Jump for Joy does  block off these dangerous areas and does not have staff monitoring in the play area.

The gate that allows entry into the play area is not monitored by staff and is very frequently left wide open. I personally walked over and closed it four times while we were there (Two of these instances the staff were not busy, just simply not paying attention). The gate does not automatically close. This is a huge safety concern for anyone with a toddler.

Jump for Joy markets towards small children the owner states in a recent review response ""When first setting up the business, I only wanted to be a facility for the smaller kids to get their energy out"". This along with other reviews mantioning the lack of attention to the entry and how easy it would be to take a child from here were concerning but we decided to give the place a chance.

I am disappointed that the reviews were accurate and I have to add to the negitive reviews. This place has so much potential, they just need to reevaluate their safety protocols.

How can you market to small children but have so little concern for their safety?

Review: Just had my sons 3rd birthday in one of the party rooms. I was a little unimpressed with the security/entering the building. We just walked in and there were people everywhere. Also people jumped right on the play floor without even speaking to the front desk. The little gate is easily opened by all the kids. I just kept thinking about how easy it would be to walk right in and grab a child and leave (a real fear for a mother) Other than that, the party itself went smoothly. I did think it was a little overpriced to rent. The kids did enjoy themselves and that’s what matters most! My son does have a cold now unfortunately. But I understand that’s a little unavoidable when you have that many germs in one place. Good not great.

Review: This was our first time here since it became Jump for Joy. We visited all the time when it was Jump & Bounce and it was so great. Super clean, very nice employees. It’s completely different now which is a huge bummer. My daughter had her birthday party here with the laser add on package & it was a disappointment. The two girls working were so unfriendly & unhelpful. The place smelled terrible, it was dirty, and the bathrooms smelled worse. The laser add on was a waste of money- the fog machines barely ran and each kid was supposed to get 2 glow sticks. We had to ask multiple times for glow sticks and they ended up not even giving enough for one per kid. We did her birthday at WePlay last year and the difference was night & day so I wouldn’t waste money here again.

Parents shoes- There are multiple parents wearing shoes and flip flops in the play area. 2.)They don’t seem to regulate capacity. 3.) The sign on the front door, right when you come in-indicating “if you have sick kids- go home” isn’t clear to some. On numerous visits, There are visible sick kids every time we have gone in. 4.) This place doesn’t seem to wipe down or have any cleaning standards- I have never seen them wipe anything down. This is a very fun place for kids, but it isn’t fun to pay and then go home with sickness and germs. You guys should have at-least one employee on busy times walking around making sure safety and cleanliness procedures are being followed. I’m sure you guys can do better and I hope you will.

Review: Avoid!!! We were there this week and a child pooped in the tunnel toy and took the worker 20mins to get off her phone to go clean it up then another 30mins to decide to shut the toy down to get it sanitized. My kid has gotten violently sick from this place due to the lack of cleaning here.

Review: I have taken my kids here twice, and I think it is a great spot for keeping the kids busy and being able to keep an eye on them. In other trampoline parks, I was constantly changing my ""spot"" following one kid around and trying to get the other to do the same. At Jump for Joy, I can sit on a comfy couch (or massage chair!) and keep an eye on both my kids. You can see most of the play area from the couches.

The kids love the indoor playground, and my older child is into the bounce houses. They have a lot and bouncy slides, too. Even though it doesn't have trampolines, he says he likes it as much as the trampoline parks, if not more.

There are toys for younger kids, too. Toddler cars and toddler play area. They even have a little baby play spot and jumperoo next to the couches. They really thought of how families would use the space.

Side note. My son is autistic and has noise aversions, the bounce houses didn’t bother him too much and he had a whole area where he could play without the light noise. This place is really perfect.

Review: The facility is very clean and has much more to offer than the CDA location. However, the amount of air freshener in the play area and the bathroom is overkill to say the least. Not to mention how toxic it is to breath that amount of synthetic chemicals is. They have zero regard for those who are allergic. I sadly won't be back due to this alone.

Review: Brought my two under age 5 for some play time.  I have a one year old, so we only had to pay for one.  We stayed for nearly three hours and it was more than worth the money.

I loved having the couches to lounge on.  The kids played with some of the ride-on toys, then the playground, then the bounce houses.  There's enough that they stayed busy but not so much that it was overwhelming.

The place does look dingy.  Really, if they would add more overhead lighting, it would be much better.  But don't let the appearance put you off.  It was clean and entertaining - a great place to get out with small kids!

They were both so friendly ensuring all of our party guests were having fun & playing safely. They helped set up our decorations, snacks/food, drinks and even did our cake cutting. The event ran smoothly, and most importantly everyone had a great time!

If I ever have a birthday party for a group of 2-5 y/o kids, I would definitely aim for having it here because I am so comfortable just letting my kid roam the small place. They always offer a bouncer seat for small babies that come along, too. Just a friendly, helpful bunch!

Review: Wow, what an amazing place for a party! So glad that my daughter requested City Play for her 5th birthday party. I loved that we had the entire space to ourselves for the party. Parents all got to socialize while kids played and there were no concerns over trying to keep track of where they kids were. Everyone had a great time and the party was relaxed, not chaotic like a large indoor playground type of place.
City Play is spotlessly clean and decorated to the finest detail with adorable and real life items that inspire kids’ imaginative play. It’s my child’s favorite place to play.
Best of all, our hosts from City Play (Braelyn and Hope), were incredible. They took care of all the details small and large. They helped with timing, took care of setting up and cleaning up, and even helped to hand out cupcakes and pack up our items at the end. They made sure each detail was handled and the party felt truly effortless. I would absolutely recommend anyone to have their child’s party here, it is worth it. You will be well taken care of!

Review: Phenomenal birthday party for my daughter. Brooke and Braelyn went so far above and beyond to make everything run smoothly I was blown away. I had multiple parents comment to me about how well planned and run the party seemed to be, and I had to tell them it wasn't me - the two women working there deserved all the credit. Not only did they physically assist with all the moving parts (set up, clean up, kid herding, etc.), but they also had wonderful ideas without being pushy about anything. They even had a candle for us, the one thing we forgot.

The facilities themselves are extremely clean and well maintained, and the kids had a lot of fun. I was also really happy that the company doesn't scrape off the top of the tips left for the workers (I specifically asked). These workers work really hard and deserve to be taken care of by their employer, so points to City Play for not siphoning from their tips.

Thanks again Brooke and Braelyn, you two were so sweet and helpful and I'm sure you'll be seeing plenty of those parents again for their kids' parties!

The space is constantly changing and puts children at the center of all the decisions. We have been to others and they don't even compare... Or the toys are broken or limited over time. The staff is welcoming and actively cleaning and reorganizing the space. The only downside is when they get really busy but that's a great problem to have. Come early near open or during the week.

The owners make you feel welcomed and part of the family. My daughter was nervous at first but one of the staff came and showed her around and even played with her in between wiping toys down.
They also don’t make you feel rushed to get out the door when your 90 minutes is up. I live a distance away from this play place and there is one closer (5mins driving) but I will continue making the drive. Hello
Thank you City Play for being so welcoming,  you definitely have a repeat costumer.

Review: We absolutely love City Play! The cleanliness, customer service, and experience are all 10/10. The staff are so welcoming and they are constantly cleaning and resetting the spaces. The toys themselves are always being swapped out, so every time we’ve been back, there’s something new to play with. We’re so happy we saw the sign and decided to check it out.

Review: It was a great experience. My son had a great time. At first I thought we’d feel unwelcome due to my husband and I being the only colored people in there but I didn’t expect the staff to be so nice. A staff gave my son a sticker when we were leaving because he was crying to stay. This place is a 10/10 for me.

Review: Very fun for my four year old, she never got bored. Everything was cleaned, I couldn’t believe how hardworking all the staff are, they are really on top of things. Sometimes it’s overwhelming, like they’ll clean up while the kids are playing still and then I feel bad about making a mess.  They’re always super friendly though. Wonderful staff.

One complaint is that the floor is extremely slippery. They require nonslip socks but even then, kids fall all the time. My daughter wasn’t even running and slipped and fell and cut her neck on the little bridge. She got really, really hurt. They were nice and made sure she was okay but I don’t think we’ll be back any time soon. Her neck is swollen and has a huge cut. Poor thing. I wish they’d get a better flooring. Have your kid wear super grippy socks or buy them at City Play, theirs are the best.  I also wish there were another restroom. Hard for little kids to wait when they gotta go!

I really appreciate that the owner emailed me after my daughter got hurt to check in!

Review: We live in Milwaukie and discovered this place when our babysitter brought our toddler here on a day out a couple weeks ago, and it was the perfect spot to meet up yesterday with a friend who lives on that side of the river.

Everyone on staff is really friendly and engaged with the parents and toddlers. We had an especially great experience with Jas/Jazz (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!) who is truly excellent at her job. They are constantly walking around and reorganizing and cleaning up toys so all the stations are ready for play.

The play space is incredible! Every station is spotlessly clean, beautiful and perfectly themed with miniature versions of a cafe, home, firehouse, vet, market, farmyard, and gas station! There’s a school bus the kiddos can climb in, a play structure with a fast and fun slide, sensory stations and activity tables. The kiddos in our group especially loved the fan system that makes the play silks fly and the market where they got to fill carts with miniature grocery items and check them out at the register.

There’s no outside food allowed to accommodate for allergies but they do have snacks available for purchase, though I didn’t check prices. Admission is really reasonable for an hour and a half playtime. The bathroom is wonderfully family friendly with a toddler toilet seat, toddler seat with straps, and footstool at the sink, and it’s even stocked with diapers, wipes, and feminine supplies that you’re welcome to use which I thought was a really nice touch.

My one and only criticism is very minor - that the employee room/stock room have a door or baby gate in place of the current curtain. My toddler ran in there a few times and I had to chase him out. Beyond that it was an absolutely perfect experience and we’ve already decided with our friend that we’ll be bringing our kiddos every couple of weeks to enjoy the space.

Review: I am someone that never writes a review but the experience I had at City play for kids is deserving of one.

My family and I hosted our daughters birthday party at City Play & they did and OUTSTANDING JOB!

The are is place is incredibly clean & the hosts do a great job ensuring it stays clean.

They also helped my husband and I set up the decorations. They were efficient, kind, welcoming  and came up with ideas to ensure the decor was prepared and in the right spots while our kids were able to play.

The options of play spaces, dress up options, toys and stations not my kept the children occupied, some of the parents joined them in on the fun.

There were a couple of accidents and the hosts were kind & understanding. Quick to clean up & give options as to how to help the parents & the children.

The hosts were SO on top of it and truly helped the parents be at ease while also ensure that the party came together.

I truly 12/10 recommend City Play and look forward to going back sometime. 🙌🏽

Review: This place is incredible and so cute. On a cleanliness level, it is absolutely pristine and organized. The employees are constantly tidying and putting toys back in their right places. The pretend spaces are fun and engaging, and our toddler loved it. The snack area is a great addition and I love that they have Apple Pay and self checkout. All the toys are still in excellent condition. It makes the pretend play area at OMSI look like a dumpster. (Sorry, I love OMSI, but the space and toys have really taken a beating.) I am just astonished at how polished and lovely it is. Worth the drive from Portland.

Review: I have been taking my toddler here since she turned 2, almost a year now. She loves it so much! It’s small enough that I feel ok with her wandering away a little bit, but there’s so much to do. She gets to interact with other kids, I get to chat a bit with parents sometimes. They alter their layout and activities often enough that it’s something new every time we go in.
However, the best part is the staff and owners. They remember you, they remember your kiddo(s), and while they are picking up around you they are also playing with the kids and it’s so much fun to watch.
I have also taken kiddo to the new place by the mall, Chicky Play Museum, and although it’s super fun and they have yummy snacks, the staff isn’t interacting with the kids or you do it feels much more impersonal. My kiddo likes both places so we’ll visit both places, but as a parent I actually enjoy City Play much more.

Edited to add: I really REALLY appreciate as a parent that they are open for play times all day, as opposed to the other indoor play place where it’s a limited time slot. That makes it hard as a parent of a toddler to make sure we get the most out of our time. So thank you City Play!

Review: CITY PLAY is incredibly clean and well-maintained, which immediately put me at ease. The play areas are varied and exciting, offering a great mix of physical activities and imaginative play options.

The staff and owners are exceptionally friendly and welcoming. They go out of their way to ensure that every family feels comfortable and has a great time. Their dedication to creating a safe and enjoyable environment for kids is truly evident.

I was particularly impressed with the level of cleanliness and organization. Everything from the play equipment to the seating area was spotless. It's clear that the team takes pride in keeping the place in top condition.

We have been to other indoor play places in Vancouver and felt let down with high prices, unfriendly staff and the lack of cleanliness.

Overall, City Play is a gem. It's a fantastic spot for kids to burn off energy and have fun, while parents can relax knowing their children are in a safe and clean environment. Highly recommend!

Review: City Play is our *spot*. I have 3 kiddos, ages 5, 3, and 2 and they jump at the chance to go to City Play. They could play cafe, market, vet clinic, fire station, house, ALL DAY if they’d let us 🤩 They’ve given SO much attention to detail in each space - The creativity of the owners is unmatched. They’re always switching the toys out so the tables in front have new stations every time we visit - my 3 yr old always appreciates that and gets excited to see what’s new. And I get great birthday present ideas 🥳

As a parent, going to City Play is a lovely little break. I don’t have to worry about snacks - They have tons to choose from for purchase. But the biggest thing I rave about to other parent friends is that it’s so clean! Even the bathroom is SUPER clean and fully stocked with everything I need to handle a dirty diaper situation (I don’t need to stress about having diapers and wipes on hand). They’ve seriously thought of everything. My only heads up is that it’s usually chilly in there - My kids never complain about being cold, just me 😆 so I dress accordingly lol

Bring a coffee and enjoy ☺️

The employees are friendly, inviting and very thorough with sanitization and safety.

I would suggest making this part of your weekly rotation as we have. You will not be disappointed!

No silly filling out online reservations like this new place in town. Nope I just call see if there is a waiting list and get put on. My kid never wants to do a scheduled thing. He wants to go when he wants to go. I hate the online schedule garbage of this other place we have by the mall. But city play has consistently been the best! Not only the ease of getting in but membership prices are freaking fantastic! I also love the owners too and the staff. They make you feel like family and we just have a playdate with our kids. I feel like the other place gives off a your child is just a number vibe. Everyone knows my son and though he is wild and crazy sometimes they open up with full hearts to my spectrum child. The place is CONSTANTLY being cleaned by staff and the self serve snack area is SO convenient for those days momma needs a pick me up w coffees, energy drinks, water and snacks! Honestly take your kids here. You won't regret your choice and get the 12 pass membership!!! Such a good deal!

It is kept very clean and organized throughout the day. I appreciate that there is something like this in walla walla to allow kids to play when it's too cold or too hot outside, which is seemingly 10 months out of the year. They offer various membership options to fit any preference of frequency of facility use and there are options for renting out for parties and other events are hosted by owners here for members. Overall a great small business that I hope thrives in our town!

Review: Update:

This place continues to be brilliant. I love it. Worth the drive everytime. My kid literally squeals when he walks in. It's my favorite of all of the indoor kids play spaces!

This might be my favorite indoor kids play space in the Greater Beaverton Area!
(We have tried Leka and Play Street Museum)

What we love:
• the ability to see your kid from the couches/cafe area; no losing sight of your kid in different rooms
• the cafe! We loved the idea of freshly made warm drinks! There are pastries, kids snacks, bottled drinks and more for purchase!
• the playground structure is AMAZING! The configuration is great for toddlers and bigger kids. The huge slide is impressive and still accessible for littles.
• the individual play spaces are unique and fun! We loved the vintage diner and the grocery store vignettes (our kid LOVED the scanner for the grocery store!)
• it wasn't over crowded and really seemed to include parents in the thoughtfulness of the layout and space.
•the price! We appreciate it was cheaper than some of the other similarities places and driving to North Plains was barely farther than we go for other places.
We will definitely be coming back and purchasing a pass!
•Unlimited play: we loved that we could stay as long as we wanted to :)
Staff were friendly and place was clean and pleasant!
Highly recommend!!

Impressed with the variety of things to do for the kids, including slides, interactive stores, train sets, etc.

On days off school, they limit playtime to 2 hours which we didn't find to be an issue at all. It never felt crowded and we got to play with everything we wanted.

The coffee shop is a really nice touch as well.

Review: Hi Elizabeth,

I understand that you mentioned a whole roll of toilet paper being in the toilet, and I wasn’t able to reply or edit my message. However, I didn’t want to focus solely on that because it seems to be a recurring issue. The employee herself mentioned that this happens frequently. Given that the facility has a lot of children, it’s likely that toilet paper gets flushed multiple times throughout the day. In this case, it was an easy fix with a plunger, yet she spent over 50 minutes trying to resolve something that could have been handled in about five minutes.

I want to be clear that I’m not trying to be rude or disrespectful, but this situation requires some accountability instead of just placing the blame on the client for a clogged toilet. Additionally, the middle sink was also clogged—if you run it for about 5-6 minutes, you’ll see that it doesn’t drain immediately. This isn’t just a toilet issue; it’s a plumbing issue that needs to be addressed. Maybe it hasn’t been noticeable in the past because it wasn’t used as frequently, but we washed our hands multiple times, as did the children.

Regarding the vacuuming, while I understand that keeping the space clean is important, many guests (including us) found it disruptive. In our culture, it’s considered disrespectful to vacuum or sweep before an event is over. I could understand if there was visible mess, but there wasn’t—yet she still took out the vacuum. When I mentioned it to her, she said she was vacuuming the entrance, but there was clearly nothing there. It seemed like she may have been irritated, possibly from a long shift, which I completely understand. However, vacuuming in between people’s legs and under tables while they’re talking is highly inappropriate and disruptive.

I just wanted to share this feedback for awareness, and I appreciate your time in addressing these concerns. Thanks

Review: We had a great time overall, and the kids really enjoyed the space. However, there were some issues that made the experience less ideal. Our booking was from 1:30 PM to 6:30 PM, but the restroom was unavailable for quite some time. While we were told the manager would come, we ended up fixing the issue ourselves, though many guests had already left. The sink in the center was also clogged. Additionally, staff started vacuuming at 4 PM, making us feel unwelcome despite staying within our reserved time.

I later received an email stating that I would still be charged additional fees, which I don’t mind paying. However, I believe there should be some consideration, as I was unable to use the restroom facility for nearly an hour. Given the circumstances, it would have been more reasonable to acknowledge this inconvenience. Overall, I wish the experience had been more welcoming, especially during booking and arrival. A more accommodating approach would have made a big difference.

Review: We had a short stay in Portland and this precious play place was on our list of things to check out. Both my 6 and 3 year old loved it. We stayed for 4 hours and they could have kept playing for the whole day. The aesthetic is beautifully thought out and not chaotic at all. Everything was super clean and you can just tell the owner put so much love and intentionality into the whole design. Coffee and snacks were a bonus. Both ladies working there were so kind and helpful. Wish we had this in our home town!

Review: Watch out for sneaky last-minute fees! We booked this place well in advance to celebrate the birthdays of four friends born in February, only for them to spring a $150 extra charge on us just a week before the event. Why? Because it was a “multi-family event”—even though our total guest count was still within their limit. If they had told us this upfront, we would have booked somewhere else. Instead, they waited until it was too late to change plans. Paying $150 just because four kids were celebrating together? They ended up charging us $50 extra but this still leave a bad taste in your mouth.

In addition to the $50, we were rushed to leave and told we had only 15 minutes to clean up when we were supposed to have 30 with the staff going to guests personally to ask them to leave prior to the end of the booked 2 hours. Despite this, the staff received a generous 20% tip ($40) on the remaining balance at the end of the party so I’m not sure why the owner is claiming she was “mistreated”.

It really is a shame that this business chose to be like this toward families who have been frequent patrons.

Review: Weekday open play review:
I was so excited to try a new kids play place and support a small business, sadly this is not the place to go and I will never be back. Any one of these things wouldn’t have been a deal breaker but when you piece it all together it’s a hard no. I’m sure this place would be perfect for parties!

We picked this place since they didn’t have a time limit, we checked the night before but then after we all paid they told us there was a 2 hour limit due to a planned school closure. They should’ve put that on the website ahead of time.

I loved the idea in theory of having adult seating and a cafe, they encourage parents to work remote or chat while kids play- the downside is most parents aren’t watching their kids and no staff are supervising. Bigger kids hit our toddlers and pushed them out of the way and the parents did nothing, but then got upset when we told their kids to not hit. You can’t have it both ways.

One long play session also seemed like a great idea, but it meant 45 minutes after opening all the toys were moved around and nothing was in the proper area so there really wasn’t much for the kids to play with- one kid filled up a cart with all the toys and prevented other kids from playing with them (see above parents not paying attention…). The staff tried to pick a few things up 2 hours after opening for a couple minutes but it didn’t make a difference. On top of that, a good portion of the trains were broken.

Food- we gave our toddlers a snack (allergen-free), and then were told we can’t have outside food. No problem, but when they asked if it was our first time visiting when we paid it would’ve been helpful to tell us the rules. Later we saw a small sign in the corner that wasn’t very visible. However, I looked around and every single table around us had outside food including lunch boxes, snacks in ziploc bags. Things obviously not sold there. We were the only table they told not to have snacks. Several parents had outside drinks that weren’t water. They said it’s for allergens but the kicker is we have a toddler in our friend group who was there with allergies (SEVERE anaphylactic reactions)- none of the foods available except for one or two things would’ve been safe for him. Other kids were bringing foods that he was allergic to into the play area. The place isn’t even top allergen free or anything- it’s just peanuts/tree nuts which most parents can comfortably accommodate by not taking it out like every other kid focused establishment. Enforce a policy uniformly or don’t have it at all. They said we could leave to have a snack and come back but it was cold/snowing- we chose an indoor play place for a reason. Admission also isn’t cheap and they expect you to buy their food on top of that if you want to eat inside.

Great idea, poor execution. Far enough out of town that we won’t be back and we’ll stick to our other usual play options.

The toys and play areas for the kids are unique and well thought out, and the staff is incredibly patient, kind, and helpful! On top of everything, the pricing is very reasonable, and they continue to slowly introduce some new toys over the months but still keep a lot of the regulars which is super nice for the kiddos!

Review: This is a very fun place to bring children. It’s nice to have somewhere they can play and roam without fear of injury. However, I wish they would add hours just for toddlers, especially toddlers not used to playing with older children/siblings. We have left earlier than anticipated more than once because it gets dangerous for the smaller children with older children playing. Watched a little boy take out no less than 3 kiddos (including my granddaughter) at the slide with no intervention from parents.

Review: Very fun place with lots of ways to play. Well organized and maintained. I almost deducted two stars for their food policy, but the facility is very good so I'm being lenient. You're not permitted to bring food or drinks. I was told water is ok but nothing else. The food options, in my opinion, are poor choices for a meal. It's basically all snack food. The best option is usually a bagel if there are any or a else a sugary muffin. I would rather pay a higher price to get in and bring my own food or pay a fee to bring my own food. We don't go as often as we otherwise would because of this policy, but it is a fun place.

Review: Read a few comments in a Portland parents group about this place. Kids were dying to get out of the house on the tail end of a long winter break. I showed them photos of this place and they were both so EXCITED to go. Honestly I was excited just for coffee and to let the kids to go crazy.

We hopped in the car in St Johns and drove the 40min across portland to go check it out. My oldest was PUMPED. Google said there weren't many people there so I had high hopes. We finally pull up, I unbuckle both kids and we walk up to the door to find a sign that reads ""closed for a private event."" Nothing about until when or for how long. I could NOT explain to my 4yo why this play place was closed to the public at 2pm on a SATURDAY. I crammed two screaming kids back in the car and was able to salvage the day at Playdate PDX.

Believe me when I say I won't be making that mistake again.

There were around a dozen children and it didn’t feel crowded at all. There are so many different spaces.everyone was spread out. It was great they had the slides and playground but then all the different interactive areas like the restaurant and fire station.  The owner and her co worker were super friendly and were constantly on the move keeping everything picked up.

Review: I’ve taken my younger kids for the last two weekends. Today I had an eye on my baby when I was approached by an employee and a mom, and told by the employee “your kid just hit two kids.” My 3yo was out of eyesight, and I hadn't noticed what he was doing for a couple minutes. But this was so off putting and hurtful. In my 15 years of taking kids to playplaces (I have a teen also), I’ve never been approached like that before. I want my child to keep his hands to himself. I will 100% correct his behavior. But to call me out in such a public way and with another mom hurt so badly. If they weren’t having fun, I would have left. My review is based on this - the space is very nice. My husband works weekends and there’s only one of me. Next time, maybe ask quietly not to shame someone. Also, it seems a lot of people are maybe all friends as there was hugs with the employees. My toddler was hit twice after with kids on the push cars. I didn't say anything because of how embarrassed I was while there. Who do I tell? Are you friends with them? I ask that you not forget to treat everyone equally.  I didn’t want to leave an emotional review but I do want to feel welcomed at places we patronize.

Follow up - not sure why it shows I only recently reviewed this place, as I did so almost immediately after it happened. Months ago. We haven’t been back since. I’m stating that I was shamed publicly and you’re making it sound like my 30lb toddler was on a rampage. The “I’m sorry you feel” is just an added layer here. No accountability for how I was approached. Mom didn’t seem super emotional, she was just with you. Very evident my family isn’t wanted here as we are a disturbance to all the friend groups. I should also add that my children were the only black children here. And it was at capacity. Maybe that escalated the concern? Anyway, floored by this response so we will stick with other play places.

Review: My kids and I love this place!  The staff is friendly and the play area can entertain the kids for hours! They have great coffee and tables for working, snacking or visiting with friends. It’s a great place to go to get work done if I have my kids with me. It’s also always clean! They do such a great job! When it’s cold outside make sure to check the headcount on their website to make sure they aren’t near capacity before you go. Such a helpful feature!

Review: I have noticed the selection of kids snacks, but its just not what i serve my baby. Anyhow, i gave my bb a small snack ( how ive done in the past) to munch while I held her and the girl on staff kindly noted that ""outside food"" was not allowed. Definitely was NoT going to snatch the snack from my daughter's hand , but i agreed to let her finish and not give her anything else. I felt super weird agreeing to that as I feel every kid should be able to have whatever snack they need to have to be satisfied, especially after playing and working up an appetite. Either this rule needs to change or more snacks need to be offered . Even then, thats so much more expensive to have to buy snacks inside. Probably will not be back because of this , my girls are too particular with what they eat and Id rather save myself the hassle.

It's a wonderful space to let your kids play and be able to relax and visit with other parents and friends. The space is clean and beauitful and the service is incredible! Throughout our time Elizabeth reset play areas and sanitized spaced - she went above and beyond. We will definitly be back!

They did all the set up and cleanup, all we had to do was bring cupcakes and a present. They took care of the pizza order and handled everything extremely professionally and well. Highly recommended!

Review: We had our child’s birthday party at WePlay and it was awesome! The whole place was super clean and well maintained, especially the big play structure!! There was even a special area just for younger kids, which was great for our little ones and made it easy to keep track of them.
Our table was set and decorated before we got there with everything we needed and a welcome sign. We got to pick the color of plates and table cloth- they thought of all the small details like including wet wipes, hand sanitizers and even a lighter for the candles. Along with pizza, chips and water bottles were included for each child.
All the kids had a blast—they didn’t want to leave! The staff was super friendly and helpful the whole time. Check-in was fast and easy, I made sure to remind everyone to sign the waiver ahead of time. I definitely recommend WePlay for birthday parties or just a fun day out with the kids!

Review: 0 star if i could. They refused to let me sit in the waiting area (it was empty) even though i was very pregnant. They said only one parent is allowed to come inside to watch the kid. Then they forced my husband to buy socks even though he had his own socks and he was not going into the structure. We left after my son playing for only 5 minutes. Very bad customer service, we never come back since then even though i keep receiving their messages about some discounts.

Review: We attended a birthday party at this facility, my 5 year old daughter went down the slide and landed in another child’s puke that had not been cleaned up. She was not the first nor last kid to get this puke on her. She was soaked through all her clothes in someone else’s bodily fluids and crying. All up and down her side, so soaked through her tights and sleeve of her dress.  When I asked if they by any chance had a lost and found or anything I could throw on her really quick so she wasn’t sitting in this, they let me know I could “purchase a shirt.” But that they would give us new socks for free.  This is not my definition of the cleanliness they tote, nor good protocol if a situation like this arises. I sent an email informing them of the situation and got no response. Maybe more staff so puke isn’t left sitting around? And complementary t shirts if a child is sitting in someone else’s fluids that were left unattended long enough for at least 5 kids to have the same outcome?

Review: We have celebrated 5 birthday parties here as well as a number of play dates! Our 5th party celebration was just yesterday! We love everything about We Play! Staff is always so amazing, friendly and genuinely care about you, your child and the experience you have, it is so much cleaner and well taken care of compared to any other child play place i have been to, pricing is so much more reasonable and affordable compared to other places, communication is always top tier, the fact it is also completely enclosed and you and your child are stamped the same to ensure complete safety within their establishment is a huge relief! Even when enforcing the rules to ensure everyone in the establishment is enjoying themselves in a safe environment, they are always kind. Every party/interaction we have had here has been nothing short of amazing. I consider the staff here my friends and I truly enjoy bringing my kids here for any reason and celebrating their birthdays! Personal shout out to Cassi, the manager, for always being so kind, genuine, understanding and amazing when scheduling all our parties. I always enjoy talking to her. Another shout out to each of our party hosts we have had for always being so accommodating and caring to all our needs. I also recently had the pleasure of meeting the owner, who was also extremely friendly, kind, caring and another genuinely amazing person running this establishment. They really go above and beyond to ensure you have the best experience possible.

Review: ⭐ 0/5
We had a terrible experience at We Play on a rainy day with our 20-month-old. To start, the pricing is ridiculous. It cost us $17 for our child, $7 for one adult (the other was free), and then $2.99 each for “full grip socks” that we were forced to buy, even though my child already had grip socks that were deemed “not full grip.” Meanwhile, parents who were part of a birthday party were clearly wearing regular shoes without issue. When my husband mentioned he wouldn’t even enter the playground, they still insisted he purchase socks.

Once we got inside, it was utter chaos. There’s no structure or staff oversight. In the toddler section, my son tried to interact with another child while playing with a toy ice cream stand, only to be pushed repeatedly by the other child. This happened three times before the other parent finally intervened—after we called out for them. Most parents were sitting on the sidelines glued to their phones, oblivious to their kids’ behavior.

The worst part was in the “4 and under” section, where older kids were spinning dangerously fast on a toy, hanging off the sides and running recklessly around it. My son was simply walking nearby when they knocked him over. There was no staff monitoring this area, no one enforcing age limits, and no one available to address safety concerns.

This place is a disaster. If you’re looking for a safe, structured, and enjoyable environment for your child, do not come here. It’s overpriced, poorly managed, and unsafe. We will not be returning.

The staff was always kind, the facility was always extremely clean and my kids enjoyed the playground & toys each and every time while improving their coordination. I have an almost 2 year old and a 4 year old but even our 12 year old niece loves this place. They have plenty of seating, allow you to access the internet and allow food. My only “complaint” would be that I wish the baby changing area had pull curtains for privacy but since the bathrooms for the mall are right across, it’s truly not a big deal.

Review: This place is way too overpriced and I had to pay $17 for my 1 year old child to enter in order for my older daughter to play. $43 for two hours of play and 1 pair of grippy socks is insane. Then I couldn’t help my 1 year old in the toddler section because I didn’t have grippy socks but my son was fine without them? My son could hardly do anything in the toddler area anyways and there was no infant friendly toys. I will stick with Jump for Joy down the street.

Mission accomplished for tiring out the kids 😜 you have to buy their socks but get to keep them so we will just bring them back with us. It was perfect for all ages honestly. I saw a lot of parents playing in it with their kids. There is also a four and under section for little kids. The food court is right next door if you want to bring something in with you while your kids play. We will definitely be back.

Review: We typically love coming here so much so that we have a membership. However, the last few times we have gone, there have been multiple sick children, which in return have caused my child to get sick. The kids are coughing up a lung and are allowed to just run around. The last time we were in there was a very apparently sick child she was coughing such a deep mucas sounding cough, and one of the employees knew them and didn't say anything, she knew not only the kid by name bht the parents as well. This makes me really not want to bring my child in anymore because we are always seeing the sick kids being allowed to be in there and playing. I guess since covid isn't as big of a deal anymore, the post covid rules for coming in sick don't apply anymore. It's very disappointing.

Review: Very highly recommend taking your kids here. This place is always extremely clean, the staff is friendly, and it’s very fun for both the kids and the adults. One of the really nice things about this facility vs the others is the fact that adults can go on the structures with their kids. There are a lot of activities to do, and even snacks and drinks available to purchase and enjoy at the tables. I’ve had my son’s birthday party here the past two years, and it’s always been a hit with his attendees.

Even if they're just sitting! I had my 7 year old playing and my other daughter was in the mall with friends. Her friends left and WE HAD TO PAY FOR HER TO COME IN AND SIT! I NEVER leave bad reviews, but this is the SECOND horrible experience I've had here, and I want to warn others!

Review: ""If it wasn't for the kids""
This is an entire racket. Overpriced and no bathrooms inside. If you're there with multiple kids while your wife shops you're expected to put everyone's shoes back on, and tote them to the bathroom located in the outer mall.  They don't offer much more than the city park. 2 stars because the staff were friendly and attentive.

Review: At first I was excited to see kids under 1 year old are free, and I totally understand the need to pay for special socks. However why is there a charge for a 2nd adult (who will just be standing there watching my baby play)? I just feel like that's quite unnecessary. I didn't end up going here after all because I just don't feel it's right to only let one parent come in for free.

My suggestion would be to call ahead of time in case there's too many birthday parties going on at the same time, otherwise there might be a short wait time. The only downside is that you'll need to buy their socks for a few bucks

Review: Didn't get her name but a staff member was incredibly rude to a friend and I on multiple occasions. Not entirely sure what she had against us or if she was just having a really bad day. Gave off the ""I hate everything and everyone vibe.""

We stayed for about 30mins, the rude employee made us feel unwelcomed and targeted so we opted to leave. Unfortunately, souring the experience so it wasn't worth the cost for us which is really too bad. Didn't even get to fully explore the area.

Seems like it's great for 2 and older kids. Fun idea for a birthday parties, and a great option during the winter months. Love the concept, just not the one staff member.

Review: It's fun for kids, however I wish they restricted by age, not height. My son is only 5 and he's in the 97% for height so he is right at the top of the ruler for measuring. Seems a little unfair, especially since his cousin is 7 and very very short and is no where near the top of the measurement ruler.

Review: Compact FREE indoor playground for toddlers to Kindergarten children. Just need to scan ID at the front. No age limit although parent supervision is required all the time.

Playground equipment, kitchen toy, kids tables, book & carpet area, big blocks and 2 bouncy houses. Table and chairs along the wall for easy supervision.
No food or beverage allowed in the playroom.

You can rent a room in front of the playroom for a birthday party etc. $50/h, minimum 2 hours. The playroom remains open to everybody even if you rent the room for a party.

At 2024 Jan bowling alley is not in operation.

I feel bad for her having to put up with some of the entitled parents who come here though. It's free with a military ID but I've heard people complaining about the fact that food isn't supposed to be brought in (because allergies are a thing!!) And last time I was there someone was complaining that she wasn't watching the kids. That's not her job!!! Parents are supposed to be watching their kids. I mean honestly!!

My wish is that they open during hours I can take my son during the week. I believe they close at 11am or 12pm during the week and I'm at work during that time. That said, my son can only enjoy the benefits of Sounders on the weekends. No place can be perfect but Sounders is pretty close. Add a grill and soft drinks and we'd never leave, lol.

They somehow deleted lots of complaints from google..

December 2024 Assault happened here!!

I don't usually repost things but as a parent, I can't not warn / notify other parents
We had our daughter's birthday here after this horrific incident and had no idea until this vague post by Jungle Playland posted today...we would not have rescheduled her party here or supported this business another day after this incident or how they horribly and unprofessionally handled the whole situation.. we are sick about this..
Just a heads up in case others parents here have taken their children here or plan to..
Heartbroken and prayers for the affected children and families💔

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: If I could give 0 stars, I would. This indoor playground is absolutely disgusting. I do not recommend bringing your kids here. Don’t know why I decided to come here twice but I will never be back. We lasted about 20 minutes before I was repulsed and had to go scrub mine and my child’s hands and leave. It is filthy, sticky, and reeks of dirty equipment. There are crumbs all over the floor, and the cubbies are sticky and stained. And there were stray socks laying around in the playground. There are areas inside the playground that can’t be accessed by adults (I had to fully lay down at one point (and yes I considered throwing my clothes away)) so clearly no evidence of the place being cleaned. There is no limit to how many people can enter and it was packed to the brim both times. There is no AC, and no air flow. It was extremely hot and the air was thick. Entrance fee is $16 and I don’t know for what because clearly nothing is being cleaned or maintained. If you do come here I recommend staying in socks the entire time and bringing a change of socks/clothes for your kids. And a bucket of hand sanitizer.

Review: The place would be great BUT it's not kept clean, nobody enforces rules about socks, and nobody enforces rules about the toddler area.
Infants paying the same price as older kids is pretty wild especially if they're not going to ensure that the one tiny area for infants is available for them to safely play in and CLEAN.
There's 2 to 3 employees here and all they do is sit at front desk on their phones.
Meanwhile, smaller kids who've paid to play are run down by kids with parents who don't care.
Its not MY job to parent other people's kids when I'm paying for an area for my kid to play.
The foam blocks all have bite marks and teeth marks on them, there was dirt and hair all over the place.
It was gross.

We were the last party to they were flexible in ending time and Maddy was so helpful in arranging food, chairs, table covers and even helped in cutting the cake. Their tape was not sticky so we couldn’t put our decor that was a bummer but they more than made up for it by being such kind and welcoming hosts. Their facility was also fun for all kids till age 10 in our party!
Highly recommend!

Also, if you are going to be going in with your kid, make sure you bring socks. They do have them for sale though if you forget

I immediately got to the front desk and asked if they  actually cleaned every day and say ""yes."" I don't think so. There's poop. The lady seemed bothered to clean it. She cleaned it, and my kid really wanted to play. So, I went and checked, and nope, there was still poop going up the stairs. Turn around and asked for a refund and left without knowing if she actually cleaned the stairs. Last time going here! THEY DO NOT CLEAN!!

Review: My kiddo did have fun here, but the lady at the front desk was not friendly at all. I know you don't have to be super like off the charts cheerful, but it's a kids place so you should somewhat act a little happy and customer friendly.  I also think the price for kids 2 and under drastically needs to change because almost $15 after tax for a baby that wont play near as long as a kiddo is ridiculous. The toddler areas really need cleaned, and their blocks definitely need replaced because they are super old and gross. I also stepped on a staple while in the area which makes it a little worrisome and I'm glad my daughter didn't get it instead. Other than that, the main area is definitely fun. I would also recommend possibly putting a 3 and under trampoline in the area.

And now here we are again with hand foot and mouth after going once more. The only common denominator to both if these instances was visiting this facility within 3 days prior to the outbreak.

Ill be calling tomorrow when they open to notify them of our latest adventure but would encourage parents to steer clear until they can prove better cleaning practices are in place.

Ill also note that my expectations are already fairly low for a high traffic play facility like this so I promise I’m not just being a Karen. There needs to be some serious improvement.

Review: Funtastic Playtorium in Alderwood offers a range of engaging activities for kids, but it could benefit from better maintenance. The facility wasn't as clean as expected, and one of the suction ball games wasn't working properly and could use some repairs. Despite these issues, the play structures and climbing areas are still fun for children. The staff is friendly and attentive, making it a decent spot for a day of active play, though improvements in cleanliness and equipment maintenance are needed.

*Gave three stars only due to cleanliness and repairs* else would give five!

This will be the last time visiting here with family since they want to charge for each adult. For our daughter's grandparents to come in and just watch her it costs an extra $20. No point in charging adults that can't even use any part of this place. Not to mention the lady in front wasn't helpful in anyway.

I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: Overall we had a positive experience letting our kids play at Junebug, but a few things I noticed that seemed different than what I expected. Other than a giant ballpit, there were no other play structures or spaces that seemed to be designed for more active play. There were so many wonderful spaces for imaginative and creative play, which my daughter loved. But I know my son was looking for more opportunities to get his energy out.
They have a small more baby friendly corner, but it is not closed off from the rest of the play space. And the rest of the space has several non-baby friendly toys that present choking hazards.
The creative play spaces are all closed off in mini cubicles. So if you have multiple children, it is impossible to keep eyes on all of them at once, making the small toys an extra choking concern.
If you have older toddlers or young kiddos, this space would be great for you! (The kiddo potty and sink in the restroom were a big hit with our toddlers!)
But I wouldn’t recommend it for mamas with babies or younger toddlers who still put small items in their mouths. And it’s not ideal when looking for a place to let your kids run and play to get their energy out.

Review: Junebug is a wonderful indoor play space on rainy or sunny days. The space is clean and inviting! Many different play areas to keep the little ones busy and engaged. I am extremely impressed with the simple idea of having a high chair in the restroom for infants/toddlers so caretakers can use the restroom without fear of the little ones touching the restroom floor. Delaney is a wonderful asset to Junebug with an inviting smile and helpful attitude!!  Thank you Delaney for assisting in us having a wonderful experience. I wish I lived closer to the area so my family and I could come more often.

Even the restrooms have a miniature toilet, sink, feminine products, and hair ties! The nursing room was so relaxing and had a changing table with diapers of all sizes. There is an infant section and a section with desks and craft supplies for older kids.  They also have cute apparel and a little shop area in the front. We will definitely be back!

I could tell they put a lot of thought, planning and time into putting together their vision and bringing it to life. There was plenty for my kids to do and the space feels spacious for people to spread out and play. You can bring your own snacks and food which is awesome. We will definitely be back! 2 hours was plenty of time for my kids to play and enjoy their time. They even give stickers to your kids on the way out as they leave to make saying goodbye a little easier.

We are in the mall right now (May 14) and wanted to have our 2 year old daughter play here. The place is just closed without notice!! It does not look like they closed down, there’s just no staff that showed up to open the place!! I do not recommend this place!

Review: The concept is great- soft toys and areas for little ones but everything is out of date. There’s Tape everywhere to patch things up, missing pieces to equipment, batteries on toys don’t work, etc.  This place needs and upgrade/upkeep and honestly not sure why it’s still open, it seems unsafe. I didn’t realize how run down things are until coming in otherwise I would have chose elsewhere for my kids to play.

Review: This place is not Disneyland. It’s about $12 for an all day pass, and the equipment is weathered, HOWEVER this is an AMAZING place to bring a little kid. The bathrooms are clean and part of the reason for the weathered look is the staff is committed to keeping the surfaces sanitary. I’ve brought my 5 year old here since he was 2, and soon he’ll probably outgrow it, but the entire point is either my wife or I can stay here while he burns off his energy and the other can shop at the mall in peace. The 1 star reviews are, I guarantee, all vitriolic Karen’s that don’t tip if their server isn’t grinning like a Stepford Wife.

Review: This place is D I R T Y. The pictures looked cute so we took our 2 year old and 10 month old. The concept was there but this place heavily misses the mark. The structures are falling apart, corners fraying, toys are broken and it’s so dirty. I’m not sure if it’s mold on the ceiling or just dark dust, but this place needs some serious upkeep. After we took our kids here, our 10 month old got very sick, throwing up for days. They have a ton of signage everywhere threatening fines for children disobeying rules, but when we were there, a birthday party was going on and the family had multiple older children the bulldozed my 2 year old off of the spinning balls and were absolutely destructive, with no repercussions. This place needs HELP. Avoid at all costs until some much needed TLC is invested 🤢

Review: My daughter is 3 now, we have been bringing her to WW since she was about 9 months old. It is still her #1 place to ask to go. I like that it is simple, closed in space, and has play structures that provide different levels of challenges (i.e. my daughter worked up to going down the baby slide, and then eventually graduated to the big slide.) Your experience here will depend heavily on 1. Time of day and 2. Which staff are working 3. How busy it is.  If you want to book a party I'd recommend an after hours one so your party goers are the only ones there unless it is going to be a small party.
I have to agree with the other reviews that say that it is kind of getting to that point where they are going to need to temporarily shut down and revamp. At first glance it looks pretty clean but like the other say if you look closely, the tape is wearing off and foam tiles are coming apart, etc. But gotta say of all the play places, it is the lowest stimulus and I feel safe letting my 3 year old run about without having to be right on top of her.

Review: We were there 20-30 mins max today. The male working at the front was friendly and pleasant. There were many people there with kids of all ages.
We are a AFRO LATINO family and noticed quickly that we were not very welcome
By some of the other customers. There a family that was (CLEARLY Middle eastern because of headdresses) . It was a  husband , wife and infant (10-15 month) old baby.

This family constantly rolled eyes, stared our
Kids down with the “evil eye look” and made angry faces towards us simply by coming in,

We have an 8yr old , 6 yr old 2 yr old and 1 year old. Our 2 year old happened to be walking backwards in the play area and their baby happened to be crawling directly
Behind her , the middle Eastern mother rolled her eyes and stared my two year old down simply because she took two steps backwards in front of her baby.

My two year old had no idea that the infant was behind her. She didn’t fall on him
Or Anything, i was able to call her towards me to prevent any incidents.

Point is: wiggleworks should create a sign or billboard that states that this is an inclusive environment that accepts all families regardless of race, gender or etc…. This is america. Kids play with kids from all backgrounds. We don’t roll eyes and stare other peoples children down.. that can cause arguments and fights…they are clearly racist and everything else.

We never said anything to the staff. Again yes they were some sort of middle Eastern but still, This is America , even if my daughter would’ve walked into the baby , generally we dust them off and get them back to playing…

The power went out and that was our cue to leave….the power shut back on maybe 15 mins later but i wouldn’t return until i see something noted that shows they support all people…
These folks made us feel so uncomfortable… 39 dollars wasted. My kids loveeeddddd the establishment but how can you enjoy it if adults are being ignorant and mean simply because you’re there. My kids just wanted to have fun. They weren’t running or being loud. They walked to each piece of equipment because they were mindful of the smaller kids there.

Please wiggleworks , post a sign stating that you’re inclusive and welcoming to all because clearly not all customers understand that . I was so close
To addressing that family but i chose not too because id rather post this.

Review: Play area is great for small children.  Upkeep is to minimum, but I believe that is due to business model and staffing.  The lady staff member on duty seemed to not prioritize opening on time or getting assistance as she had lost her debit card and left the front desk during her shift.  During this time customers came and some left after waiting 10+ min and others came in and dealt with the payment details when she came back ~20min later.  Come care could be put into supporting the staff members here, which of course potentially elevates the business.

Review: D.I.R.T.Y. this place needs to be shut down for a few days and d e e p c l e a n e d. A lot of the structures are taped together. Paint chipping off of the walls. Dirt accumulated on most of the infant toys and structures. Stuff broken. Like zippers that keep the structures covered with foam. This will be the last time we come. Gave an extra star for the sweet girl working. She is so kind and good with the kiddos. She was doing her best to vacuum, pick up, etc but this needs a shut down-no guests level clean.

Review: Place is disgusting, duct tape holding everything together including light switches and outlets. We had our kids birthday party there and at 285 for 1.5 hours not worth it. One of my kids popped a balloon and a staff member told everyone in there that ""if your kid pops a balloon we'll charge you for it"". Then when our 1.5 hours was up in the party room same person came and stayed rushing us out. We stayed for another 45 minutes to let the kids play and no one went into the room at all. Took staff almost an hour to get us the balloons we paid for. Not well kept facility, rude staff, expensive, and only 2 bathrooms.

Review: My toddler actually gets the most out of this place. We tried taking her to the children's museum in Olympia, and it didn't work out for us. We spent all that $$$ (more than $40 for 3 admissions), but we didn't really get to use all of the places in the museum because my toddler is way too young to understand what's going on to even apply her skills to those areas. The children's museum is a great place for a kid who wants to learn. My toddler just wants to jump around and be crazy.

I actually wanted to go to South Hill Mall for shopping, but my toddler led me to this place because she saw slides and balloons. All you have to do is to sign up for your phone to be registered with the place, which the internet at South Hill Mall sucks for my T-Mobile, so the attendant had to register it for me. Anyway, she advised me the registration would be valid for 3 years from today. It's basically $12 including tax on the weekends per kid, and you can stay there as long as you'd like. It isn't charged hourly.

My toddler has a blast at this place. She loves the area with the fan blowing the balloons around and the bouncy/ slide area. Lol ! I am definitely coming back here for my toddler to exert her crazy energy out!

The only negative was  WiggleWorks being quite a bit smaller of an area than Jumping Zone. I was pleasantly surprised with the friendly service I got from the attendant , the entire area appeared clean & sanitary(included the restroom) & there was  sufficient climbing items/areas to keep the kids entertained for several hours. I felt the price for admission was also fair

It is so dirty and needs a lot of TLC. Please clean this place! Maybe close down mid day just for cleaning? I don't see this place lasting much longer in this condition. I will be taking my son across the street to kaleidoscope.

Review: Place is so disgusting and in need of major repairs or a total gut job - hence all the other comments. Has the health department been through here…EVER?  Staph infection waiting to happen. Do you really want your infants and toddlers climbing around here? Shame on the owners for leaving it in this state and being too cheap to upgrade and do repairs. It’s almost…almost laughable. It’s been like this for years. Sorry, nothing positive to say about it. Enter at your own risk.

Review: The only complaints that i really have is that their cleaning could be a little better, but honestly it's a place for kids and as a mom i know that when you have kids they dirty the place constantly and it is tiring! Also i wish their party room had a taller table for the adults. I hope that they fix the duck tape thing too! I loved their play structures and everything was safe and my kids enjoyed it. I booked my oldest daughter's birthday party here and the staff guy was so kind to us!

Review: My son absolutely loves Ahoy Kitsap Playland, and it's become one of our favorite go-to spots in Kitsap! We visit often, and every time, he has a blast — especially with the slides. The whole place is incredibly kid-friendly and safe, which gives me peace of mind as a parent.
The atmosphere is bright, clean, and welcoming. It's clear the staff cares about maintaining a fun and safe environment. One of the best things is that parents can actually sit back and relax while the kids play. There’s plenty of comfortable seating, good visibility of the play areas, and free Wi-Fi — a rare and much-appreciated combination for any indoor play space.
Ahoy Kitsap Playland strikes a great balance between active fun for kids and a laid-back vibe for parents. I highly recommend it to any families looking for a safe, fun, and clean place to let their little ones burn off some energy!

Review: My kids and I genuinely love this place. My kids play non-stop and it gives me an opportunity to sit back, relax, and watch them safely play from a nearby table. There is an area for smaller children that has open ended toy play, as well as the main playground. It’s clean and the staff are very friendly. The only downside is that you can’t bring in your own food/snacks. My kids have fallen in love with the snack bar, which is extensive. They also have hot and cold food options, a coffee menu, milk shakes, ice cream, drinks for kids and adults, etc. I have nothing had to say about this place. We come back and back, over and over again, especially on not so nice days. We drive over from Gig Harbor.

Review: I would have given a better rating if they were more accommodating to kids with severe food allergies. My son cannot eat a single snack option they sell inside but they refuse to allow ANY outside snacks even for babies/toddlers who they do not offer safe food options for. This is severely disappointing considering they sell a TON of food and drinks inside so it’s not about not allowing any food or drinks you just cannot bring your own even with anaphylactic allergies even though they don’t sell fully allergy safe snacks. Seems like discrimination to me.

Not sure if I will be back considering this limitation. For the price of $16 a kid you want to stay more than an hour to get your money worth but can’t bring safe snacks for your kids.

Review: Place is clean and nice. Smaller children's playground is easily good for children 8mo+. The larger playground for children 3yr+ is great as well. Kids easily run around for 2-3hrs.

Snacks are decent, mostly sugar treats and not terribly prices. They now ""serve"" alcohol buts it's not worth buying. It's easily not only marked up 5-7x the price (so $7 for a rainer beer) but it's also their ""policy"" that you have to buy a snack with any alcohol purchase so now it's even more expensive. What a joke lmaoo. If they lowered their beer to $5 and no stupid snack they'd actually sell some.

Review: Hard to find b/c the sign is fairly small on the highway; turn in to the United Rentals road and then go up the hill. Lots of parking. The indoor play area is huge (think of several McDonald’s indoor gyms put together). They have two small birthday rooms with tables and chairs and a sink (up a staircase) but not accessible as far as I could tell. I’m not sure if there is an elevator to get up there or not so folks should ask about that if needed. The kids had a wonderful time though…the family brought food and gifts and the kids played for hours!

Review: Fun place. A lot of climbing, jumping, sliding and places to hide BUT kids always ended up with severe lower GI issues. I ended up with Covid over Christmas after seeing Santa. Do not think it's food related as most items are prepackaged. Other grandmas have agreed about illnesses after visiting when we are arranging play dates.  Need better and more effective cleaning practices I'm guessing.

Review: This place is a nice alternative to the park when it’s rainy/cold, but there’s really not a whole lot for little ones and the area dedicated to them doesn’t have a very secure door, toddlers can just push it open and escape into the bigger area. They also changed the rules so you can’t bring in your own food, which I kind of understand for allergy reasons. The virtual reality area is pretty cool but I’m not sure if the price overall is really worth it to go all the time. I spent a good amount of time trying to keep my busy toddler inside the toddler area and then chasing him around to make sure he doesn’t get hurt by the bigger kids, so we both got some cardio in at least!

Room was small, hot (even with a portable ac that hardly worked), and smelled like wet dog and chemicals. Decorations wouldn’t stick to the walls and kept falling down. They gave us a mop to hold up the piñata by hand on the end of the stick handle. Play area looked packed beyond capacity. Standing room only, parents looked miserable. We were rushed in and out. Bathroom was filthy. Owner was rude and condescending. Spent over $400

Review: Fun and safe place to take the little ones. Is a well-disguised and entertaining prison, (one child-accessible exit) which means that us parents can mostly relax despite not being able to see them at ALL times in the large play area.
Went to a birthday party here which was reasonably priced with a private room.
Would go here again.
They get 4 stars here when it really should be five because they require you to purchase a food item with an adult beverage even after spending at least a few hundred dollars on a party that includes food purchased from the venue.

One of our kids was pushed down a slide, we reported it (as the sign posted says to do) and the lady just walked over and told my husband that the kid wasn’t doing anything that very moment so they did nothing, then why is there a sign to report it? I don’t understand why there a multiple signs posted with rules but yet not one is enforced.

Review: Avoid this place and if you do go DO NOT buy a membership or use a card, only use cash. It’s small and extremely overpriced. Membership is expensive and if you decide you don’t want it anymore they require a months notice and if you are even 24 hours past what they consider the month mark they will refuse your request to cancel and charge your card anyway. Even if you’ve moved and will no longer be using their establishment, which I did make clear to them. They will charge your card without your permission even after removing your card from their system they keep it and use it anyways. It’s absolutely disgusting how administration treats people. They also do not enforce rules and safety. Older kids often trample through the toddler area and at times hurt smaller children. They also run up the slides causing crashes and safety issues. One of the times we were there a child fell through a broken area in the upper level and my husband and I had to climb the big slide and push her up to get her to safety as she was just hanging half way through stuck and her mom couldn’t reach her. And lastly they do allow sick children in which creates an unsafe medical environment as well. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: My toddler adores this place and so do I. It’s always a clean and safe place for her to blow off steam and for me to get a bit of a break. I have helped host for goddaughter’s birthday here so I can attest to the birthday parties here being fun also. They have a small room for cake and gifts and the kiddos get to play their hearts out. So much fun.

Review: Had a blast at Ahoy Kitsap! We went on a weekend so it was a little busier with regular visits and a few birthday parties going on. Our son is 9 months right now and the little kids area was perfect for him, loved all the foam climbing blocks and the cars to drive.

But warning, you need to watch your kids, it is very busy with kids everywhere. If your child is small like both of mine keep extra close eye incase you need to step in and help.

Review: I will never be coming back here. We waited for 10 minutes for the employee to return to the store before we could pay and enter. When she finally returned she had a bag from Victoria’s Secret and didn’t apologize for us waiting.

I don’t think food is allowed but there were people eating food from the food court next to the slides.

As I waited next to the slide for my daughter to come down, I saw a MOUSE running around on the floor. We immediately left disgusted.

This is my favorite place to keep both my toddler and my 8 year old entertained. It’s affordable and they even take Apple Pay ( I learned that after dropping my wallet before a playdate 😝). A big thank you to Akash at Funtastic Playtorium for helping provide uniforms and equipment to The Norpoint Soccer Club for TWO YEARS! We appreciate all your support and feel so grateful that Funtastic Playtorim is so invested in enriching the lives of the Tacoma community children.

Review: This was our 3rd visit here.

The front desk girl picks and chooses what rules she follows.
First off, she insisted on following the $10 per additional adult for us. But not every family that followed.
Additionally,There are several adults and children with out socks on. Which I consider a sanitation issue.
And several people eating. While it says no food or drink.
And last the place smells like poop. It was very dusty, and filled with stains.

Would not recommend.

Review: This place was okay, took my daughter and my nieces, a play day for my daughter's birthday. I liked that it was not busy.
As soon as we walked in, there were a few people just chatting and talking behind the register. They all just looked at us, and one girl just kept talking and talking and talking. So I decided I'll sign the waiver form until someone greets us. But nope, no one said anything. I eventually stood there for a bit until they were kind of done talking. I would have left, but I know my daughter really wanted to play. The lady who helped is kept going on about how she was not supposed to be working today, but came in anyways. ""Thank you for being here."" I said to her. She then continued to go on about how long her nails were and how it kind of got in her way while she worked. I guess, I just let her talk. Eventually I had to use the restrooms, and it looked like those rest stop restrooms. Both were dirty, with toilet paper on the ground. Dirty toilet, needed to be cleaned. I saw the employee go to the back a few times, I guess she never made it to the bathroom, or didn't want to be bothered by the bathroom.
It was an okay experience. If these things were corrected I'm sure it would be a great place.

NOT all children like pets, mine in particular is allergic to them and does not like to interact, he is scared.  People are with drinks and food when there are signs saying no food or drink.   They should have more control with that.

Review: We’ve had so many problems with this place. Most recently, we bought a membership where we pay $100 something and get 10 visits out of it.  Something in the back of my mind was telling me to keep my receipt because I didn’t trust this place to keep track of my membership. And lo and behold we come back and THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. I gave them the receipt and that was the only reason we were able to go in.

So I would NOT purchase a membership here because this place may decide to magically lose your $100 membership and you’re out of luck if you didn’t keep your receipt, which you shouldn’t have to.

Another time the employee yelled at my 3 year old for playing in the ‘36 month and younger area’ while it was empty. Shes 3 not 10, it was completely empty, and she just wanted to play nicely with the foam blocks. I would have taken her out if there were babies or she was being too wild.

They do a nice 10 pack which is the best value, it’s got good lasting play value and the front desk is always friendly.

Yendy is especially nice at the front desk.

There’s a mini trampoline, a cute swing, a little climbing wall and obstacle courses.

Great location for a kids play place and of course heads and shoulder above the free playground in the mall.

Review: I never write negative reviews, I like to give companies the benefit of the doubt. But this place, I would give zero stars if I could. Came here with my 4 kids, and they had a group of kids in their late teens playing tag. My kids couldn’t even play without being almost run over.  The amount of times they almost tackled my 5 year old is unacceptable. It clearly states that it’s for kids under 10. I mentioned this to the person in charge, and nothing was done about it. She just sat on her phone the entire time. Worst 60$ I’ve ever spent.

Review: We had never heard of this place, but went here for a friend of my son's, 6th birthday party...and we ended up having so much unexpected fun!!! It was way better then any of those trampoline parks, (my son agreed too) since it actually was for kids around his age; 10 years and younger are only allowed.
I also appreciated the security system that they had in place for my kids safety at the front entrance, so I was able to let him run around freely, knowing the staff wouldn't allow him to leave the establishment without being ONLY with me!
We will be returning here again indefinitely, now that we know how SUPER AWESOME it is here, and even if it's just for an hour or 2 to burn off some energy!
Well worth it, to see my son's smile!!!! 😁
Thank You Fantastic Playtorium Tacoma!

Seems like every time we go in with a 2 year old and a 5 year old we are paying $30. Unlimited playtime but the kids only wind up playing for about 1.5-2 hours. Still worth it on rainy days when the kids can't really play outside. I wouldn't make a special trip for this location, but if you're already in the mall and your kids want to play, it's alright.

Review: Had my son's third birthday here. All of the kids had a great time. The play area was well suited for the kids at the party that ranged from 2 to 10. My three drawbacks 1) the dedicated party host that was included in the package did not happen (she never came in) 2) the party room does not have a sink so there was no way to clean up the frosting off kids 3) there were two bathrooms but only one was open. At first I thought it was out of order but then saw one of the girls working there open it and go in. There were so many kids and their families there using just one restroom and there was almost always a line. We will come back to play again.

Review: Very good fun place for children.  They can play all day, step out for lunch or go shopping and come back again and all at one set price.  Not too keen on their security as we were able to pass by their front desk unnoticed as they were attending other families.

Review: If we could leave 6 stars we would! We booked a party here back in December and one today and both went amazing. All the staff is friendly and attentive, food was great all the kids loved it! We were even able to play with our kids if we wanted to which was very surprising! 3 hours was just enough time to let all the kids burn out their energy. I saw a few people say they’re expensive and if you’re comparing them to a free public park then sure, they are. But they make it stress free to have a kids bday party PLUS we didn't have to clean up afterwards, and that to me is worth every penny. We'll definitely be back.

They treat you like family and I’ve never had a bad customer service experience.

Review: Only issue I have which gives it 3 stars is they allow kids greater than 36 inches in the less than 36 inches area. Which makes it tough when you have little ones specifically. I hope they start following thru more in this as it is advertised only 36 inches and under is allowed in this area. Just prepare yourself for kids not being watched by their parents too. $$$ too.

Other than this great local spot for kids to burn energy.

Review: Not really impressed! They have a lot of fun things for kids to do but 1/3 of the area is dedicated to 36 inches and under.  They will let you come in if you’re an adult and purchase their $4 socks.  They wouldn’t let my 13-year-old daughter go in with my four-year-old granddaughter to help her.
It’s worth $10 but not the $22 you pay plus $4.00 for socks. We brought her own slip resistant socks but apparently you have to purchase theirs.  They claim it’s a safety issue, but clearly it’s just to make more money.  I don’t think we’ll be back. I’d rather take my kids to Get Air or Quake for that money. The Rollarena and bowling is a fraction of the price and are just as much fun.   The employee checking us in, even proceeded to tell me that some of the other places that require their own socks, take away your socks that don’t belong to them.  Really??!!  Quake steals your personal purchases clothes??  Come on. I’d rather just about give anywhere else my business.

Review: I enjoy bringing my kids here but I really dislike how the “Tots” can play in the big kid area, it’s really unsafe having the two age groups mixed which is why I assume the big kids aren’t allowed in the toddler area. The tots need to be kept in their little area just how the big kids are expected to stay off to the other side in their area. I don’t want to babysit my big kids every move and make sure they don’t accidentally plow down some toddler that’s just run out in front of them because the toddler isn’t being watched. If the end goal here is safety then the littles shouldn’t be mixed in with the big kids.

In my opinion it is a tad over priced for the little ones under 36"", but well worth it if you stay the full 2 hours of playtime. From what i was told 1 and under play free.

You all did an amazing job. My only complaint, if that’s what you wanna call it, and I hate to even call it that because it’s not a complaint but that It was a little warm, but I guess with that many bodies running around having fun you will have that. Everyone that came with my party had a great time, and I have no doubt we will be back again. Thank you so much for a great time.

Review: Place is cool and everything BUT the place allow any adults with the necessary sock to claim up in the upper level inside the enclosed kids play area. sure these adult might be the parents of other kids BUT do you actually trust them in an enclosed area with your kids?
What's these adult background?  Or if they actually parents of any other kids? Some parents are actually distracted hard to notice anything.
Make your own decisions. I decided what goes on with my kids. And I'm not a big fan in the idea of having another MALE ADULTS sharing the enclosed Play area next to my kid.
Folks the dream land play ground is public, nothing fancy, but it's open and you actually can watch your kid without worrying about the kid is playing way up there in an enclosed area next to these adults.

Review: Recently had my daughters 6th birthday here. The facility was extremely hot and one of my partygoers ended up with an extreme heat rash and had to leave early. Every child was extremely red and overheated. The staff was rude and did not check on our party at all, outside of dropping off the food that we had to wait forever for. One staff member brought fries on accident, then came back and took them from the kids even though she informed us they were now going to be thrown away. I asked to leave them since they were getting tossed, and she said “sorry, I can’t, my boss is here” and left. Nobody brought us plates or a cake knife. We had to track somebody down each time and the cake knife was filthy.

Booking the party was a nightmare. Online says Fancy is on sale at 299. Online booking wouldn’t show the sale price so I called instead. First staff member told me it was not the Fancy party that was discounted but then apologized after viewing the website and realized they were wrong. They transferred me to a manager to book since the front was busy but the manager was short with me and rudely told me the sale price was “sold out”. She did not ask me any questions about the potential party. I booked online anyways and then inquired about it again at check out after the party. The staff member checking us out told me the sale price was available any day besides Saturday. Had I known that, I would have booked the party for a Sunday to get the almost $100 dollar discount. Why did the manager not explain this to me during that initial phone call? Why tell me it was sold out? Why not ask me which day I planned to have the party? The manager, Griselda, was unapproachable and rude over the phone during that initial phone call as well as during the party.

The owner was there and finally came out to talk to me. However, they lied and told me she wasn’t the owner and that the owner lives out of state. A quick internet search showed me she was the owner…it was very odd that they didn’t tell me the truth? She clearly did not care to rectify anything. She didn’t speak English so a staff member spoke to her for me about the situation. All she offered me was 40 dollars (gift card) for my next visit even though I paid close to 600 after everything. I wish I realized who she was while I was there still. Although it’s such a weird situation to pretend you’re not the owner!

The lack of professionalism, the terrible customer service, the lying, the heat that no one was willing to fix, the lack of accountability…the whole experience was so unforgivable. I’m so disappointed.

EDIT to respond to reply:
You guys had one other party going on while we were there. Every single person in there that day knew how hot it was. We heard numerous people complain outside our party and could visibly see most of the patrons sweating.
As for the booking, I called because I wasn’t going to sit and enter in different dates. I should be able to call and expect honesty, information, and great customer service. Your employees gave me three separate and conflicting responses and Griselda was terribly rude. You reviewing your software system means nothing and is not related to the situation. I was able to book, the discount wasn’t applying. I should have been told why and not that it “sold out” which wasn’t true.

I left that day defeated. Only reason I was somewhat calm and nice upon leaving, was because Jessie, your front desk employee, was great at handling things. As far as I knew, he’d done all he could do (this was before I knew he was also lying to me about who you were). I knew that outside of that, I was not going to get any more help and decided to email the owner. Although you were there the whole time but did not convey your true identity as owner and did not speak English. What else was I to do? The manager left. You are dishonest and I’m so disgusted at how you chose to handle this whole situation.

Why respond to this review but not my email? Your response here is misleading and isn’t even close to addressing everything.

I want my money back.

Review: They desperately need a policy of not letting sick kids into their establishment. One kid would not stop coughing the entire time and was very noticeably sick. Another kid was also doing the same thing and was coughing so hard that he eventually vomited all over the floor. Yes I get it, it is a kid play area and you can’t expect perfection. But this was a pretty easy call when you have two kids who are coughing so hard that they don’t stop. And shame on the parents for bringing them. But whatever. Sadly, this ruins the experience, and makes you not want to come back.

After 10 minutes I had trouble breathing and had to sit towards the back to get any type of relief. We’ve been to other indoor playgrounds for half the cost and they were cleaner without the heavy scents. I wouldn’t be able to return here for these reasons alone. Staff seemed friendly but I only encountered the 1 person at the front checking us in.

Review: I haven't gone but the prices are insanity. Especially if you buy the membership it only discounts tickets 15%?
Edit: visited. Much smaller than the trampoline park. Above and below 36in have about half each of play area. I'm thinking it's not worth the price but kids loved it. Turns out you need socks that say iPlay on them which are 4$ a pair. It was mostly empt on a Thursday at 430. 5 total kids. I'm thinking it it was 16$ a child instead of 22$ we might come back.

Review: Went there with my 5 children one of which is a 16 almost 17 yr old boy who wasn't planning on going into any playground and just sit there with me while the little ones played. And they wouldn't let us in at all unless I paid for the older child to jist sit with me. Absolutely ridiculous no trust in there customers I assured them he wouldn't play in the playground they said was in there contract... I read contract and it said nothing about that. Then she said was policy... which one is it??? They just lost bi customers that pay a lot each time.

Review: The kids enjoy the spot. It's nice to have the wristbands so they can't leave without you. You are able to connect to wifi and get some work done as the kids enjoy some entertainment. There is food and drinks available as well. From parents who just want their kids to play or to (birthday or event) parties, there is fun for everyone. The staff is extremely helpful and always a pleasure to work with.

Review: We normally enjoy  Iplay but unfortunately we’re not pleased with the height restrictions for the smaller area. My sister came to visit from Berlin and my niece is newly 3 but very tall. Of course she wants to play with my average 2.5 year old in the little area. She’s about an inch and a half over the limit and although my 7 year old had previously been able to play gently in that area with siblings, she wasn’t allowed. I understand if she’s being very rough or if there’s a lot of kids but there was only 2 other families here with maybe a total of 8-10 kids. There was only 2 kids in that play section and the guy employee wouldn’t allow the very newly 3 year old in there. We pay more for the “taller”age and they can only be in this section but I also paid less for my 2 year and he gets access to everything? Doesn’t make sense and was really discouraging to see her denied the more fun kiddie toys for her age}","Washington","iplayexperience.us","Wheelchair accessible entrance","99336"

Plus parents get in free with their kids and it's actually pretty reasonably priced.  I know we'll be back again.

Review: We arrived around 5 PM, so it wasn't too crowded, which was perfect. The facility felt clean and secure—you're buzzed in from the reception area after staff check that everyone has removed their shoes. My kids range from 1 to 10 years old, and there was something for all of them. Different play zones for different age groups, plus an arcade, kept them busy the entire time. They played non-stop for the full 2.5 hours we were there.

It's a flat-rate entry for the whole day—no hourly fees—so we didn't feel rushed, which was great considering we drove over an hour to get there. The on-site cafe also had a solid selection of food items, with plenty of kid-friendly options (a big win if you've got picky eaters like I do).

The only downside was seeing older kids roughhousing in the toddler area. It made things a bit stressful with my younger ones (1 and 4), since I had to stay close to make sure they didn't get hurt. To be clear, this is NOT on the employees—they were doing their jobs. This is more about parents needing to be aware and present. It's not a drop-off zone, and playing on your phones shouldn't take priority over supervising your kids. OWN UP.

That said, I'm still giving this place five stars. It's clean, well-organized, and thoughtfully designed for families with kids of all ages. We'll definitely be coming back.

Review: A fun indoor playground to take younger kids.  My 5 year old son loves it here and asks to be taken regularly.  The massive indoor playground keeps him entertained for hours.  I also appreciate the wristband system where I can feel comfortable he won't be able to leave without me.  The only minor criticism is that my son has fairly severe food allergies and the cafe area wasn't able to confidently tell me what allergens the food has.  We've learned to work around this and just eat before/after.

They love being able to run and play for as long as they want. I love the safe feeling I have with their locked gate and wristband check-out system. Sometimes it’s hard to locate both kids in an instant while they are running through the play system but I at least know they are safe and in the building.
Snacks are fairly priced and it doesn’t totally break the bank if the kids want snacks.

Review: Evergreen is such a fun and a welcoming play area! Grateful that our little ones can have an indoor place to go when it’s pouring rain or sunny sky’s! It’s great to see a place take their cleanliness seriously. I would highly recommend sending your family over to check out Evergreen!

Review: Cute boutique play club for young children. Ideal 6mo-5yr age ranges. There's a little separate area for babies and the rest of the space is free play for other young children. It is kept very clean and organized throughout the day. I appreciate that there is something like this in walla walla to allow kids to play when it's too cold or too hot outside, which is seemingly 10 months out of the year. They offer various membership options to fit any preference of frequency of facility use and there are options for renting out for parties and other events are hosted by owners here for members. Overall a great small business that I hope thrives in our town!

Review: Absolutely love Evergreen play club! I have 4 kiddos from age 5, 7, 10 and 12 and took them all this weekend to check out their grand opening event. They all spent over 3 hours playing and being creative. So many things to do from puzzles and building to scooters and climbing. They cannot wait to go back! They even have iced coffees to purchase for us tired mommas!

Review: Auburn location is a very bad place I come inside and there’s a lot of people sitting in the middle. They didn’t let my kids to play and move around because they were blocking the infants area. I asked ask the assistant manager “Angela” to refund my money she refused and stated that she won’t refund anything. The Place was so dirty and people were eating pizza inside the games and their Kids were fighting and cussing loudly to everyone, and the workers didn’t care. The place is really not safe for kids. If you don’t want your kids to get sick and to hear all bad words, don’t take them there.

Review: I have been going to big air for a while now. Each time is pretty fun, but I went for my frieinds birthday, and it was a blast! My favorite attraction was the orbit.  Karina  my sister ran the orbit, and she made it really fun for us, because she created a game for us to play that allowed my whole friend group to join in on the orbit!

I also asked her if the bull was suppose to do that because my kid got hurt and she didn't respond . I wouldn't come back with my little ones due to the unsafe environment.

Thank you for opening other attractions an hour later. And giving cards for 1 hour of free play.

Review: The family had such an amazing time here. The staff is all friendly and focused and I was impressed all around. I don't think I've ever seen a General Manager so engaged with the guests before. She'd stop and check in on guests, play with kids, enforce rules with such a polite yet firm rule. Food service was quick, the adults in the party had as much fun as the kids bouncing, running, sliding, gliding, and more.

Absolutely will be coming back again and again.

Review: Could be a great place to have your kids burn energy. They have a mix of jumping times between 1.5 , 2, and all day for 26 to 40 dollars.

However, beware about 4 to 5 of the activity areas were closed ""due to no staff member"". They only kept 1 guy manning the spin jump area and that was it. The remaining 8 to 10 employees were chilling at the front counter or the food and beverage area. Pretty sure they weren't working because only two people were manning station in the food area. The rest just goofing around and making tiktoks

Facility is clean and doesn't smell like feet, various types of activities so kids don't get bored of only jumping. Food was good, I personally really liked the doughnuts! Will definitely be booking again for next event!

Review: DO NOT BUY THE PASSES OR MEMBERSHIPS!
Every time we try to use it, they say it cant be used for this reason or another. Took my daughter at 130pm on Thursday (school conferences so half day), and the place was dead. Was told we couldn't use our pass because it wasnt ""general admission time"". You would think they would want paying customers when the place is empty. Pass says nothing about general admission but it does say they can change the rules as they want so buyer beware. I feel we were scammed. Paid a lot of money up front and every time we try to use the pass we get denied.

From booking through checkout Colin was responsive, communicative, and extremely kind and helpful. The venue was super clean and felt fun and safe! All of the kids had a blast. My daughter is looking forward to coming back for open play time next, and so am I!

Review: My 8mo old daughter is very mobile but not quite walking. I was looking for a place for her to climb on some safe padded things and maybe a tunnel to crawl through, nothing much. I found this place and the website states 0-8months can play for free. I thought how great that would be since she isn't big enough to walk or use some of the other stuff. The online booking form didn't work and kept saying I am not authorized, even after registering, so I decided to drive there and check it out. I was met by two girls at the front desk who were super rude and seemed to have no clue how to have a normal interaction with a customer. They proceeded to tell me it's only free if they are accompanying a sibling. That is not what the website states. They also looked at her and said, ""shes pretty small"", as if I am a total idiot for thinking she could play there.  Regardless, they said it would be $9 for my daughter. I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay that since she wouldn't be able to use all the toys. They said I could take my shoes off and check it out if I wanted. I agreed and took my shoes off. I then stood at the gate, waiting to be let in, while both girls stood at the desk doing nothing, for what felt like an eternity. In my mind I was thinking, hello, is anyone home, you just said we could come in and check it out. Finally after making awkward eye contact, they slowly moved toward the gate and let us in. The toys for little ones were super dirty and in that same area there was an adult, lying face down on a bench (sleeping, napping? I don't know). I walked around the other areas which seem cleaner than the toy area but honestly, not worth $9 for my daughter. Based on the lack of basic human communication from the girls who worked there, combined with the misinformation on the website and dirty toys, I won't be returning, even when my daughter is bigger.

Review: Kids had a great time but the toy area was full of dirty, broken unorganized toys.
There were multiple (5 or 6) kids there for what appeared to be respite care when we arrived. Which would have been fine except there was only one staff member who was supposed to run the front desk and watch these kids. My one year old got pulled down by her neck by a kid who was there for respite care. That same child was throwing hard toys around. It straight up became dangerous for my 1 year old twins. We specifically went there because I thought it would be good for my little ones but unfortunately it was stressful and often felt unsafe for them.

The place is very clean and everything was in good condition. The guy who was running the place is very respectful and friendly. I would definitely recommend. Only comment I have for the business, I would recommend having someone look at the bathroom from time to time. There are alot of little kids running around and the bathroom was the only place in this place that needed to be cleaned.

Review: New to the diagnostic of SPD. Not only were we able to experience all of the different forms of toys and activities along with the swings, we knew exactly just what we wanted to put in a sensory room for here at home. Having diagnosis like autism or SPD makes my daughter feel like she is in a place where there’s people just like her. I bring her every weekend and enjoy the opportunity to be able to have some time by myself and have her supervised by the staff there.

Review: Rhis business needs more attention. It is a wonderful place for any and all kids to gather and play! They have drop off services for a few hours or the whole day if you can't find a sitter. Lots of fun toys and activities for kids of different ages, and the owner is about the nicest guy you'll ever meet. He does this because he genuinely loves kids. Most definitely not for the money, because as you can imagine the last few years have been rough on these types of businesses. The cost is extremely reasonable and it's located right next to Hobby lobby and Costco.

On top of that, their staff even rinsed our dishes off after the party for us 🥹🩷 Everyone was so kind to work with, from the owner (I didn't catch her name) and all staff.

I one hundred percent would throw another birthday here and will be referring all my mom friends to Chicky Play.

They really went above and beyond with details like offering a cake stand, putting up my balloon arch and setting up cupcake stands, etc. Kids and adults had the best time the place is so spacious we had 50 guests and had so much room to hangout and play! If you’re thinking about a venue for your kids party do yourself a favor and do it here! Thanks Chicky Play Museum for an amazing time.

Review: This is a good place for toddlers to run free, but the prices are pretty high for what they offer. The main discouragement was how slow the staff was. We each ordered a drink, and the place had only two other customers in the play area, and it took them 30 minutes to serve the first drink.  Each proceeding drink was another 15 minutes. There were two employees working. One did have to stop every so often to check in more customers. I watched as the person was making the drinks, and she was just extremely slow. There was nothing hindering her other than her own low energy.

Review: We tried Chicky play museum today for the first time and my 20m old had so much fun. He doesn’t get around other kids often so it’s always nice to take him around other kids.

I also loved how the employees were cleaning and picking up the play area whenever they had some down time. You can tell they take care to keep the facilities looking good and a good environment for everyone.

We also got a snack and a coffee that was actually good. I usually have low expectations for food and drinks at places like this but I was pleasantly surprised.

We will definitely be back again.

Review: Our daughter's birthday party was fantastic and easy peasy! The owner Suki was very helpful and quick to respond to questions. When we arrived, the Chicky Play staff was welcoming and offered assistance with set up. We forgot a tablecloth and thankfully they had some for purchase. For decorations we just did a cupcake stand and a couple of centerpieces and it turned out so cute. The venue was clean and had lots of themed play areas to entertain littles. Their restrooms were clean and accommodating with toddler seats and also a changing table. This was 100% easier and better than hosting a toddler party in our home. I will say they seem to frequently book private parties on weekends, so if you are wanting to visit for an open play session, definitely check the website or call beforehand. We highly recommend Chicky Play and look forward to returning for open play soon!

Review: Never in my life have I been spoken to in such a horrible, nasty manner as the manager spoke to me. It was unsolicited and unnecessary to speak to me in such a nasty tone and voice, like i'm a child being yelled at.. I had a misunderstanding because I was told I could come in 30 minutes early to decorate. But by early, they literally meant to come at my booked time. THAT WAS HIGHLY UNNECESSARY to say to a client. If they never said that, i would assume my time strictly starts at 6, and i can do as i please with it. When I saw it written in the policy that said, ""Decorations may be delivered
within 30 minutes of the party time."" Again, I understood this as 30 minutes before my set time i can decorate. How much more unclear can you be? I understood it as earlier than the set time since I was told that in person, I had made out the invites already at 6 pm because of this. So that leaves me no time to decorate. I didn't want to push the party back because little kids are tired by 8 pm..and I didn't want a super short party if I told guests to come at 6:30. When I told them my problem, the manager took all day till almost closing to get back to me. An employee who was super nice was helping me to reschedule most of that time.. but she needed approval from the owner.  So while i waited for an answer, i went ahead and let my guests know i am rescheduling so i dont tell them last minute. When the owner contacted me, I was expecting to hear from the owner a yes or no for the coming Friday, but instead she spoke to me in an attacking manner that i can not reschedul the day before, i would basically be canceling, loosing my $200 deposit and scheduling a new day but that all weekends were booked for 3 months (so good luck!) She said to me that rescheduling has to be done 7 days prior, but I had booked the appointment 7 days prior so that leaves me zero chance to reschedul. On top of that, I did not want to have to reschedule, but because they told me I could come in early to decorate, I was counting on that. Then she told me she will not make an exception for Fridays because it's one of their highest paying days. (So my $200 deposit i'd be forfitting plus $500 for 2.5 hours wasn't enough for her). Then she told me I could come in 15 minutes early on my set time with an extra charge to do so. Because this is their policy. She was money pinching BAD! Basically, she was not willing to work anything out. And incredibly rude while at it! I couldn't stop myself from breaking down into tears because my babies birthday was super important to me. So when she realized I was holding back tears; she offered me to come in 10 minutes early. When I said I didn't want to pay more, she said if it's 15 minutes, she will charge me extra, but for 10, she won't! Money pinching makes me sick. I called my husband crying, and he said to just cancel even if we lost the $200 deposit. He didn't want to give her more money after how she spoke to me. He also remembered clearly her telling me that i could come in early to decorate when she was pitching me the party idea. Regardless of my mistake, they made mistakes, too. It was not okay to speak to me in the manner she spoke to me! I felt so mistreated!

Overall, clean and orderly with plenty to entertain your kid. Relatively fair price and kind workers. The only downside is how often I feel like people are renting the space for birthdays and parties. A totally legitimate business strategy, but really frustrating when trying to spontaneously do something fun with your kid. Otherwise, great space!

Review: Our first time here. We usually go to City Play but wanted another option. While my daughter had fun, I also think parents should be required to be in the play area with their kiddos (for the most part). It seems as though staff tell you rules when you go in, but walk past and ignore when those rules aren’t being followed. I saw two children that were completely left to run around with very minimal supervision, throwing stuff at kids, taking toys, mixing sand with kinetic sand and their guardians only stood up to peak over the wall every 20 minutes or so. Food was pretty expensive for the bare minimum.

Review: If you care about your child’s, safety at a play museum, do not take them here. Anyone can sit in their restaurant and eat ice cream  and waffles and watch the children play. The bathrooms are in the general public area with no locks and no code to get in. So anybody can use their bathrooms.
For as new as the place was some of the toys were shabby and worn down. I would guess that’s because they have a lot of people coming to play. Money seems to be spent on decorations like balloons and Christmas trees instead of replacing worn down toys.

They handled setup and cleanup and the actual event was very chill yet very fun for the kids. The space makes it easy for the adults to be watchful but not always watching which really helps with the mental load. Everything seems designed with kids in mind. The price tag is a little high but worth it. Highly recommend.

Review: Took my kiddo here for the first time a couple weeks ago and absolutely LOVED it! Such a darling play area for kids. We've visited a handful throughout the Portland area and decided to cross over the river and give Chicky Play Museum a try and am so glad we did! Everything felt clean, the staff was kind, the set up was so creative and adorable. I thought all the ""house/stations"" were amazing and so well thought through. The other activity spots throughout were engaging and entertaining for my almost 2 year old. We easily spent the whole 2 hour time slot playing together. The bathrooms were set up so well for any stage of child (diaper change, potty training, etc.) Lastly, their coffee was also good & I definitely will be getting a bubble waffle the next time we visit! (But don't go spreading around how amazing this place is, cause I selfishly want to keep it to myself.) 😉 You won't regret a visit though. It's a well designed play space!

Review: I will start off by saying it’s a beautiful space with lots to do and very spacious. I liked that for our birthday party, a custom Happy birthday sign was up and ready for us. Although I appreciate cleanliness, I didn’t like that it reeked of Lysol and other harsh chemicals. Another local play space uses non toxic sprays and thats something I prefer. Keep something in mind, because it’s a cafe as well, the staff is mainly if not only at the cafe place. I hate to compare but once again, the other local spot we like to play at, has staff on the floor at all times, cleaning constantly. Lastly, when you book for a birthday party, it’s a “2hour play time” however, decorating is only within that time frame so they ask you to tell your guests to come in 30 min later. Why would anyone pay that much money for 1.5 hours of  birthday party play time? Needless to say, I decorated as my guests walked in haha. Oh well. I wanted to make use of the time I paid for. I appreciated the help the younger girl who was working there offered me. I had to walk up there myself to ask since no one ever came to ask if we needed  anything but the young gal was super friendly and ready to help me when I did ask. I have seen other reviewers say that the staff helped clean up after their party but I was offered no help. I’m not sure if we are supposed to ask but I thought that was weird so I cleaned up myself. Overall though, we had fun.

Review: *updated to 5 stars from 4 after going again. The owner took the suggestions that were made about the hours making it much more convenient!
Super cute space! Loved that there was an area for my 8 month old to play and explore. My only suggestion on the space would be putting some type of mat at the bottom of the slide. Even with grip socks my daughter went sliding right on her butt. I also wish it ran like a few other play areas where there's a bit more flexibility on the time. Having the set time (like 11-12:30) makes it hard with littles who have set naps to get there on time. I had to wake the baby up from nap to get to our 11am spot on time otherwise we wouldn't have gotten our full hour and a half of play. Another play space I won't name just gives you an hour and a half of play and has a staff cleaning as the kids play and it makes the day a lot smoother not rushing to get there at a certain time. But it was adorable and we'll definitely be back!

Review: We are fairly new to the area and had a horribly hard winter with very little to do. We have since tried the majority of the indoor spaces for children in the Vancouver/Portland/Beaverton area and I am by far impressed with Chicky Play! The space is modern, well lit, clean, and welcoming. My son had a wonderful time playing while I was able to get some work done. They have a menu of cafés, food, and snacks. Their bathrooms were pristine and easily accessible. I could go on and on. I was honestly amazed at the care and attention to details in this establishment. We will be back and I look forward it!

Review: I need to start by saying that my kids love Chicky Play. So much so, that we drive nearly an hour to get there. I’d been happy up until our last experience last week. The good - I really do think it’s a lovely play space. I’m happy to spend the money on playtime and treats. If it brings my kids joy, it brings me joy. The bad - last weeks visit was so so bad. My husband and I finally had time to take them together and the kids asked to go. I checked capacity around 9:30 and it said zero people were playing. So we get our shoes on and head out the door. It takes us roughly an hour to get there and we were told they were at capacity, 55 people. My kids are melting down and screaming trying to get inside. Never did I imagine we would drive so far to be turned away. Or that I needed to keep checking their website. The gal at the counter was frustrated with my frustration and meanwhile, other parents are telling us to head to a local play place instead. But I’d intended on taking a work meeting while my husband played with the kids. So he drags them out crying and I go next door. Not before we both put ourselves on the waitlist. And they said they expect to see people leave within 20 minutes. Oh, I also counted and there was maybe 30 people inside. There was definitely not 55. Anyway, we decide we will try to wait because they want to play so badly. I go next door to take my meeting and he sits in the car with them. No update online for 30 minutes online. Then it switches to 47 people playing but still at capacity???? Then he calls and is told he may as well not come in now that they have space and there’s only 20 minutes left to play. We took the kids to eat and decided (begrudgingly) to take them back to the 1pm session. The gal at the counter acted as if she’d solved this problem for us. It was incredibly frustrating. We let the kids play during their nap time and pulled them out after an hour. We skipped our usual treat purchase and went home. I don’t see myself making this drive again unless we have zero other options. And I’m bummed because they do love it there. I just won’t risk a meltdown of saying we are going somewhere and being turned away. Open reservations back up and people won’t have this issue.

Review: We have loved going to Chicky and before the last few times this would have been a 5. So tired of the rules not being enforced such as parents walking around with bare feet. Last time I went no one was reorganizing like they usually do every so often so the whole place was a mess. Two gals sat at the computer just talking while the place was destroyed. The rule that needs to be enforced the most is that a parent be in the play center with their children. I shouldn't have to parent other children because the parents are using it as childcare. Otherwise we love coming here and my son begs us to go!

Review: We came here while traveling to hopefully give our small kids a break from the car. Two hours was about thirty bucks which was probably the best spent money on our entire trip. Our active toddler had the time of their life and even our infant had a blast! There is an under two specific section that was great and the larger section that was really well set up with all types of “obstacles” and equipment. It was very clean which I appreciate. The staff cleaned up and did light general cleaning/disinfecting while we were here which I appreciate even more. We will definitely be returning when in the area again and if we lived here would come regularly.

Review: I would like to inquire about the rules of your indoor playground. I brought my two children to play, and they were having a wonderful time, making friends with all the other children.

While playing and running around, one of my children coughed a couple of times, which is completely understandable as children may cough lightly due to physical exertion. However, I felt deeply offended when two other parents—who, in my opinion, were dressed quite inappropriately for a children’s indoor playground (revealing clothing that I didn’t find suitable but chose not to comment on, as I prefer avoiding unnecessary conflict)—reported my child’s minor cough to your staff.

I explained to your staff that my children are not sick; the cough was simply a natural result of running and playing, and nothing more. Despite this, your staff repeatedly came over to wipe down every toy my children touched, seemingly pressured by these two individuals. This created an uncomfortable and stressful atmosphere for us, as it felt like we were being unfairly singled out.

As a result, we chose to leave after only half an hour, cutting short what should have been an enjoyable visit for my children.

This kind of treatment is simply not appropriate. It left us feeling unwelcome and unfairly judged. I would appreciate a response regarding your policies and how you handle such situations in the future.

Review: Brought my two nephews and son to the Southcenter location to get some energy out. Three kids (two of which are mobile toddlers) and one adult can be hard so it was nice to have a place to contain them all 😆

We came on a Friday so it was a little more expensive than a weekday but that was fine. My 18 month old loved watching the older kids run around a play and I had plenty of room to sit and chill.

A huge plus was the young man working. He was so sweet and helpful! My son was asleep when we got there and he offered to turn the music down for us. We didn't need to but the fact he even thought about it was very accommodating. He engaged with the boys when they talked to him and was very patient. Good employees are so important at a place like this!

Review: Went here for the first time with a 2 year old and a 6 year old. Play area is nice, tall slide is hard to get into top area is only like 24 inches tall so adults be weary following kids its very akward to fit in. Ball pit is more like a single layer of sad balls 😄 not like when we were kids. There is a mini obstical course in the back only like 3 obstacles long but still nice. There is a closed gate only attendants open. Seating for parents on side, shoe bins for kids shoes.
There is a little toddler area, just keep an eye on your kids bc some parents don't. My daughter had her face spit in bc a boy wanted her to get off a swinging log, then some older kids went into the toddler 😑  area and were being rough with the toddlers with the blocks.

Review: We had my daughter's 5th birthday here recently and it was awesome. The party room is spacious (we had about 40 guests between kids and adults) and everyone had room to sit and visit. The staff was very helpful and friendly. It was a bit of a splurge, especially since we chose to rent the space on a weekend, but we got the room for nearly two hours plus an extra hour of play time for the kids to play after that, so for the absolutely great time the kids had it was totally worth it.

Review: Our recent experience hosting a birthday party for our four-year-old at Safari in Southcenter Mall was a resounding success. The hour of free play was a blast for the kids, and the accommodating staff even allowed us to store our items in the room. Despite a previous booking, the room was impeccably clean and well-prepared. The provided amenities made the experience hassle-free, and though it was pricey, the value was evident in the joy our child and her friends (and the parents) experienced. Safari at Southcenter Mall exceeded our expectations, providing a memorable and stress-free celebration. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch party venue that delights both kids and parents alike.

Review: Safari is a playspace for little kids inside of Southcenter Mall. It's a pretty big space and offers a private room to rent for things like birthday parties which is great. There's not too much room for parents to sit inside as it gets cramped quickly. Everything is padded and safe which is amazing. You purchase time to be in there at the front and they have little cubbies and a bathroom. This is a good place to pass an hour or two with kids to get some energy out.

Review: We hosted our daughter’s birthday here, and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish! The vibrant colors and playful design immediately set the tone for a fun-filled day. The variety of play equipment was impressive, kids of all ages had an absolute blast. The party area was well-organized with plenty of tables and chairs for everyone, making it comfortable and convenient for guests. The staff were amazing, friendly, helpful, and truly made everything run smoothly. We had such a great time and would definitely return for another celebration. Highly recommend this place for anyone planning a kid’s birthday party!

Review: We had an incredible experience at this indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, the space was clean, vibrant, and welcoming. The play structures are thoughtfully designed, safe, and cater to a wide range of ages.

What really stood out was the staff: they were attentive, friendly, and clearly cared about creating a positive environment. Safety protocols were clearly in place, and everything was well-maintained. There’s even a dedicated toddler area, which was a huge plus for families with younger children.

Highly recommend this place for a fun, stress-free outing or a memorable birthday celebration. We’ll definitely be back!

The ball pit was their favorite, and they spent so much time running around the climbing structures and playing arcade games. The place is very clean, colorful, and well-organized. I really appreciate how friendly and attentive the staff were — they made sure everything was safe and fun. It’s a bit on the pricier side, but totally worth it for the fun and peace of mind. We’ll definitely be coming back!

Review: Twinkle Land Play Cafe is hands down one of the best play spaces we’ve ever visited! The entire facility is sparkling clean, thoughtfully designed, and full of fun, interactive play areas that kept my little ones entertained for hours. From the imaginative play zones to the safe and spacious climbing structures, everything is clearly built with both fun and safety in mind.

The staff are incredibly friendly, attentive, and welcoming — they genuinely seem to care about the kids and create a positive, relaxed atmosphere for everyone. As a parent, I also loved the cozy cafe section, which offers delicious drinks and snacks, plus comfortable seating where I could relax while still keeping an eye on the kids.

Whether you’re planning a casual playdate or a birthday party, Twinkle Land delivers above and beyond. We’ll definitely be back again soon!

This charming play cafe offers a fantastic environment with a variety of engaging activities for children to explore and have fun, while also providing a comfortable space for adults to relax.
For parents, the sitting area is a real gem. It's spacious and thoughtfully designed, allowing us to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The comfortable seating and cozy atmosphere make it a perfect spot to enjoy a cup of coffee or a snack while chatting with other parents.

Review: Slightly tempted to gate keep this place. 😂

We had the party room on May 3rd. It was our first time here. Things I loved:

1) Wow, it's stunning inside.

2) It's CLEAN, whoa what! 😜

3) It's not employed by a bunch of teenagers, it's actual adults and they're helpful and professional.

4) Rules are actually enforced. Socks are required and they do have someone standing at entry to check for this. Super greatful for this as people tried to sneak in without it.

Things I didn't love:

1) It was advertised we'd have admission for the entire day, this was not true for us. If they sell the venue they will kick you out.

This happened to us. We were given a credit of 100 twinkle coins as compensation but it pales in comparison to what I expected and under minded what I put on the invitations.

2) I had a strong head count for who was at our party but I some how exceeded it, which I fear I was charged for people NOT belonging to my party.

There was an unofficial party being hosted there in the corner. I hadn't disputed it because I was overwhelmed keeping things in order and had only figured it out afterwards.

Overall, it's a great place and I would recommend it.

Review: I asked the employee working if socks were required, he said yes absolutely. I informed him that a woman with her young child were barefoot and he thanked me. He then went over to who he assumed was her husband and notified him. The man stared at him without saying a word and went back to scrolling on his phone. The employee went back to the front desk to continue reading his book. Not once did he check to ensure they had complied and the woman remained the duration of the evening with nothing on her feet. When the husband attempted to enter the play area with his shoes on, he was stopped. When he took his shoes off he had no socks on either.  I found it to be quite disgusting as there are young children in the play area whose faces make contact with all of the surfaces she had her feet on. My friends and I are repeat customers but I’m not sure about returning if safety rules aren’t enforced and employees spend their time on their phone and reading books.

Review: DO NOT BOOK BIRTHDAY PARTIES HERE. Unless - you want to pay $600 for some tables for a couple hours. Just tables and chairs. PLAY WAS NOT INCLUDED. So expect to spend another $400 or so on play time for the kids. Food was not included. No beverages. No utensils, napkins, plates, etc. also be prepared to clean up after yourself. For $1000 you really get nothing but tables and chairs. GRIP SOCKS ARE ALSO REQUIRED BUT THEY DONT EVEN SELL THEM. The confirmation email they send after booking even states to BRING YOUR OWN. Owners response is 👎🏻

Comparing all the different activities and price. We give this place 4 out 5. My kids enjoyed this play area very much however, it is very expensive compared to other place. I do appreciate the all day play and the cafe  Place is fairly quiet on week days. Area is mildly clean looking. Can't say that for the weekends.

Review: Exceeded my expectations of a play place! I wish Washington had more of these places like in California, Arizona and Hawaii!
We paid $35.26 after tax for ONLY the play area. The arcade and sensory/craft area are separate/additional charges. A lot of people comment it’s an over-priced place, but I think it’s well worth the amenities if you make the day of it, which we usually do!

Pros:
-Sooooo many activities for kids to do whether it’s constructive play time, crafts, sensory, arcade games
-Unlimited play time WITH in & out privileges
-Conveniently located in a plaza near restaurants, or just a 5 minute drive to another plaza with more restaurants
-Free parking
-clean bathroom
-Really cute and decently sized dining space for parties! (It’s not a private party room)
-Friendly & helpful staff
-Great atmosphere, visually aesthetic & stimulating

Cons:
-People don’t close the child gate properly and leave it open, allowing opportunities for kids to run out. R
Staff regulation of this would be ideal or maybe a big attention sign.
-Crowded on weekends, which isn’t a con, but there’s limited seating and people will put their belongings on chairs and rarely sit in it bcs they’re wandering around. I saw trashed/unoccupied seats for at least 45 minutes. It’d be super beneficial to have more cubby space for diaper bags so the seats could actually be sat in
-People leave trash all over the counters and leave the seats sticky

Review: My family was visiting Seattle and I thought it would be nice to check out this place. In my honest opinion $32 for all day unlimited play is expensive. I’ve been to other play places before and they are not nearly as expensive as this one. The play area only had 2 slides and not many obstacles inside the climbing gym. It’s also super dusty by the back windows and there’s a few areas that should be fixed, ie; the big cone slide, seam around the seated part at the top is ripped exposing the wood which could hurt someone. One of the boards to support the upper part of the climbing gym feels a little loose and uneven, like it could give way. Also an additional $23 to do a “diy” activity is overrated. You get to play with a little water table and kinetic sand then take home one item of 3 choices (dig up a surprise, water beads in a jar or a mini brick house). On top of that, they advertise and say there’s food and what not but I couldn’t even get a Vietnamese ice coffee bc the “barista” was not in. All that was available was canned beverages and ice cream. I got a push pop for my son that was $4 which was only a regular size one but labeled as “jumbo”. I understand people gotta make money too but come on, this is a place for kids to have fun not rip parents off. Lastly, the arcade games are expensive and the card system is rigged. Got a $20 prepaid card, played 2 games (most don’t even tell you how much it is) that were probably $5 each and ended up with $7 left. How does that make sense? I ended up giving our card to another parent since we weren’t going to come back. But overall, not too bad of a place, just be ready to spend a lot of money!

Review: Our family visited Twinkle Land on a Sunday afternoon, and it was overcrowded—probably beyond capacity. The shoe cubby area was so small and packed that parents and kids were constantly stepping on each other. It was impossible to move without bumping into someone. Because of the crowd, we couldn’t enjoy the café, arcade, or DIY tables, which was really disappointing. For a high-end indoor playground charging $32 per child just for the play area, the experience felt overwhelming and not worth the price. They really need to monitor their capacity better to ensure a comfortable visit.

Review: $32 for the small play area that my kid got bored on with half an hour. Lots of better options in the area.

Video games are $1-5 each, on average $2. There are 14 total. Chuck e cheese is up the street and WAY better (which is not something I thought I would say).

We did not do the DIY, which was $23 for a bottle with some basic decorations. You could do the same project off Temu for $5, including shipping.

Poor value. I won't be returning. I'm going to need to wash my hands A LOT after this.

All the balls and beads they have laying around make it impossible to clean. My friend took his kid here, and she also got sick.  For the price they charge, you would think they would have some constantly sanitizing the place. i will never be returning here again. Someone needs to come examine this place under x ray and see how dirty it is!!!

After we entered, she approached us rudely and said that if we weren’t there for a birthday party, we should leave. While I understand the policy, her aggression was unnecessary. When I asked her why someone was positioned at the door to stop people from entering, she simply told me to leave. We will never be back here!

Review: Do not bring your kid here if they are the age where they put a things in their mouths. TwinkleLand has these little beads in the main play area and they are EVERYWHERE. I was shocked these were in the main area instead of in the DIY section. On top of that, this place is impossible to sanitize so I can only imagine the cleanliness. There’s Wiggle Works down the street that is much better for an 18 month old toddler.

Review: EDIT:: Adjusting from 2 stars to 4 stars. The owner reponsed to most items I listed and I've noticed some big changes in my recent visits! Thank you!! :)

Overall it's a cool place and my kids has tons of fun. Lots of room for improvement though.

-- 5 of the video games are broken (don't power on or don't work correctly)
-- Cotton candy machine is disgusting inside
-- Bathrooms are out of soap
-- Staff scolded me for taking some balls out of the ball pit to put into a castle the kids were building. Like 20 balls... meanwhile there were about 300 hundreds balls already out of the ballpit and the staff doesn't care about that. Like really...
-- Some of the saftey nets are coming aparts. Notably, above the large slide.
-- They make you wear twinkle land branded socks? So dumb. Any grip sock should work...

It's a good place to go if your kids get tired of wandering around the mall. The theme is super cute and the play structure is both fun and really secure. I can almost guarantee that your kids will want to stop here every time you go shopping at the mall!

For example not accepting cash and changing the price of play. $18 up from $10 just because kids aren’t in school?? Well I guess that backfired because this place is empty right now and rightfully so. That’s crazy. $18 and my little girl will be playing for a grand total of 1 hr and 15 mins…. Not worth $18 and if she didn’t drive so far to get here and if she didn’t have her heart set on coming here today, I would have walked out.

This place is a great way to spend an afternoon in Seattle where your kids can get all their energy out while you sit back, relax and recharge. The longer you stay the easier it is to get your kid down for bed that night!

Main complaint is that all of the advertisements say $10/child for all day play and I arrived at 3:00pm on a random wednesday in early December and was informed that there was ""Holiday Pricing"" in effect so it would be $18/child. And the kids had already run off in excitement as it was there first time so couldn't exactly leave without dealing with a tantrum. The place itself is fine... but yeah, I didn't love that surprise and the worker didn't have any explanation for the spike pricing.

Review: We paid 300 dollars to rent a private party room for an hour and a half. I emailed beforehand and was informed that it was fine to bring a cake. I was not informed of any other charges. We brought one pack of capri suns and a pack of lacroix and they charged us 50 dollars for the beverages.   For this reason I cannot recommend for an event. If you are having an event I would forego renting the space.

Review: I am so happy to have found this indoor play place in Seattle! It’s definitely worth the visit. There is much more hidden play you can’t see from the entrance. They have kids and parents covered. Food, snacks, drinks (alcohol too) and even coffee. One minor recommendation, the poor employees need an intercom system (or some Bluetooth voice volume enhancer!) to make their birthday announcements. It’s nearly impossible to hear them with all of the screaming and maze-like play compartments. :) Great job guys!

Review: This is such a great concept to have in a rainy city! I love the idea and my kids (ages 6, 4, 1) had a wonderful time. It’s big enough that they felt as if they were going on a big adventure on their own, but I could see them the whole time.

The only thing that was a bit of a turn off for me is it was dirty. Not just dusty, that too, but also just felt like they needed to do a big deep clean, in addition to a more thorough daily clean. They did appear short staffed, so that may have contributed to the daily mess, but the deeper cleaning needs to be a priority because it felt gross climbing around in the structures. I totally get some food on the ground and things like this, because kids are messy, but this went far beyond that.

See attached photos of some of the spots I snapped while playing with my kiddos.

Review: Great spot. We miss having a kid play zone in West Seattle, and this is still close enough to go for a quick play party. Only issue for me has been some older kids (over 8) who were exhibiting bullying behavior repeatedly despite multiple interactions with adults near the air ""guns"". They just posted up in there and tried to hit the Kid and adults in the face.

I mention this mostly for parents to keep an eye out for your kid if they're extra sensitive or very concerned in justice in case they're having a hard time in one of big area they can play in. And to any parents of kids over 7, teach your kids about how to be better people before exposing younger kids to them at this place.

Review: You would never know this place was here from the outside but it's an urban oasis for city kids. It's designed perfectly for kids to do what they do best, go crazy. And there's a little cafe with all adults need while the kids are doing their thing. Definitely worth a visit. If you're old enough to remember, this place is like if the old fast food play spaces and ball pits were a lot cleaner and more contained.

Review: Went here for a bday party. We were in one of the rooms and all the guest were absolutely disappointed. There was hair in the food, floating idk in our drinks (also don’t sell bottle water). So we bought 6 bottles of juice which was 30 dollars. Then on top of it we almost had to pay over 600 dollars for not leaving the room fast enough at the end because they offered a service to help get balloons down that accidentally went to the roof. The kids were disappointed because of the time duration of how long we had the room. This will be a birthday to remember 🤣

Review: Absolutely loved it! The only downside is they don't have parking. So the kids go in and you can pay for all day access which is great. There's a ton of tables, so you can sit at a table while the kids play on the structure. I honestly cant say much about the structure itself since i did not go in, but my 3 & 6 year old did not want to leave. There's only one way in and out of the structure and the building so you can keep tabs on these. The drink and food selection is not restaurant quality but quite good for a kids play area. They also have alcoholic drinks. This place was definitely made for both kids and caregivers in mind.

Review: This place is unsafe. Security is not achieved by placing two cameras. A child entering the playground can easily go out by following another child. Also, there is zero security in the playground. Random items were placed and created a perfect space between them. This is an indication that children face danger at all times.

Review: Our experience was a bit lackluster. First, their online ordering platform from the website was incorrectly set up, so there were weird add-on options (such blue cheese as an option for adding into lemonade and itallian sodas, rootbeer as an add on to the coffee drinks, and then food/drink just in the wrong locations (if you clicked food, there were random drinks mixed in etc).

Once we got there the staff was very friendly, and respectful to my kiddo,  but the first order of drinks we got was incorrect (unfortunately I am allergic to coffee, and the big gulp of ""not chai"" didn't do great things for me) and they forgot our desert completely. (Thankfully I had asked for a receipt and was able to point out the mistake before we left.

The play area was fine for little kids- like 4 to 6 os probably the ideal age. Ther website said that it was a good spot for up to age 12- and given the ""interactive dance area"" (supposed to have wii like interactive lighting) and the ""ball shooting cannons"" we thought it might be OK for our 9 year old- however the ""dance area"" was broken-  no interaction to the found, and some of the ball cannons were also broken. She was the oldest by far- spent some time Palling around with some 7 year  Olds but was ready to leave after about an hour.

The food was ok. The pizza was thick crust and a tad gooey (which Is my preference so I appreciated that). The cheese and fruit platter was meh. It had a few very very sour blueberries, a handful of very tasty grapes, a few pieces of decent honeydew mellon, thw cheap butterfly shaped crackers , and some chunks of orange cheddar ( and presumably white chedder?)

Seating was plentiful, though there were only 3 spots with cushioned chairs- we ended up sitting right next to the play structure in order to sit in one of the comfy cushioned chairs, but then had to listen to the chorus of screaming kids (I know that's what kids do.. it was just not ideal for our family with an infant trying to sleep. )

Parking was difficult to come by.

It was pretty overpriced for the experience we had, though maybe I would feel different if we had a 5 year old instead of a 9 year old.

Your kids will spend so much energy that once they get home,  all they will need is a shower and a bed. The parents can sit and watch or accompany the kids in the play area.
This company has food and drinks available. Some kid friendly and some just for adults.
We will definitely come.back!

Review: I’ve been taking my kids here for years (now 7yrs old and 3yrs) and it can be a hit or miss at times. For example, the ball shooters and ball drops don’t always work and I try and avoid this place on the weekends because the amount of people they let in is insane. It appears that there is no max. One of the things that annoys me the most, though, is their “toddler area” is 35 months and younger. By definition, a 3yr old is still a toddler, and the workers still try and kick my son out of the toddler area. If a kid is 3.5yrs old they should still be allowed in the toddler area. So the micromanaging gets annoying. But of course, the kids like it and it’s close to home so I still bring them here every once in a while.

There was a sensory experience to everyone's liking, bouncing, sliding, spinning.  And of course the ball launchers were a big hit, even with the adults.

Review: Its a great place if you need to wear your lil one out. But the octopus was deflating badly with kids on it (safety issue) Ball shooters NEVER work, and they do not regularly clean the floor. When it first opened it was great, but it just got really lax. Need to repair and update their equipment. Some duct tape on stuff/Trampoline but also one of the only options for the kiddos in the area unless you want to follow them around an arcade and over pay. I really do like the place, the manager was great and helped me with an issue. And my kiddo has ADHD- so it’s great to just throw her on the proverbial hampster wheel and let her wear herself out. I will still go and I tell my friends all about it! :)

Review: I just saw a previous review saying it is for kids 5 and older. That is not true, I have been taking my son Keanu here since he was 2. They have a toddler section but not only that, they can learn to climb and develop motorskills and physical coordination at that age by allowing them to struggle a little bit. But here is the caveat, this is only doable when it is not busy. If it is too busy, you should crawl with you toddler and accompany them closely so they don’t get trampled. And if there are a lot of kids on the trampoline, don’t bother with a child under three, the other kids will bounce them around and they won’t be able to stand up.

There are bathrooms, a party room for birthdays in the back. Ball cannons, two slides one open one enclosed. There is no ball pit. The toddler section is only for 3 and under and has some developmental toys.

Warning: there are spinning carousel tea cup things that the kids can sit in and spin around. They can be dangerous if they are spinning fast and your child tries to climb out while it’s still moving. If children are using them, there should be an adult supervising them for that particular part of the play place.

Here are some videos and pictures from multiple visits. Some are from 8 months ago when my son was just over 2 years old. Some are from 2 months ago.

Review: Honestly I don’t have too many complaints about this place. Staff has been helpful when kids are rowdy, it does the job it’s there for, you don’t come for atmosphere as a parent. My only complaint is that they play explicit or inappropriate music pretty regularly. I’m sure most kids don’t even notice and I honestly don’t care much but it’s a bit embarrassing when my kids start singing expletives to a bunch of toddlers because they just heard it and thought it was funny. I love the non kid music but would love if they could ditch the profanity for such a kid centered place.

Review: I had a great first experience here with my 2 daughters. Staff was friendly and helpful with my wagon stroller. Their toddler play section was nice, and my kids enjoyed it. The big playground is meant for your child to wander the maze. My 2 year old was able to run the route 4 plus times with no issues. I find this place safe and a good experience for your children. I will for sure be checking out the other locations in the area. Thank you, and God bless Funtastic Playtorium Factoria!

Review: It’s a fun place for kids to get their wiggles out. Its for kids I say five and older. I’ll give it a three star because I’ve come here a few times on and off throughout the months and the one area with air blowing cannons and cage for throwing balls doesn’t work and it hasn’t really worked for quite some time. Right now it’s just a fixture to look at with such few balls. They used to be way more balls and I remember that Blippi did a review here and it was in much better condition at that time…So I’m not sure what we’re paying for. Right now I’m just watching some kids just throw the balls because they can’t even get the machines to work because they don’t. My boys are very disappointed. So am I. But possibly they’re in the process of getting them fixed.

Review: I started coming here about 3 months ago. I was very shocked that this place was exactly how it looks online. It’s pretty clean compared to other places I’ve been too. I always see the same gal up front. Her name is Calli. She is AMAZING! I see her enforcing rules which is great. She’s super friendly and helpful. Just from our first conversation I genuinely knew she cared about her job and the kids safety. She’s ALWAYS by the front register making sure no one’s child is walking out. She double checks their bracelets. Thank you for that! You are very appreciated! The reason im giving this place 4 stars is because I’ve noticed that other employees don’t enforce the rules.

Review: My 7 year old saw this on Blippi and has begged to go. We went on a very low traffic day (midweek, during the school day) and there were only a few kids there with us, mostly babies, which made sense. My daughter enjoyed it a lot! The woman working there when we got there seemed disinterested (very much in line with the other reviews I've seen) but she was kind to the kids who approached her, and mine when she asked a question. I liked the wristband ID system, though when we left no one was at the door to check us out and the gate wasn't secure, but fortunately I left with the child I arrived with.

The play structure requires a step in on all sides, so even on the base level where the ball guns are, and even to get into the zone with the octopus, kids need to be mobile enough to step over them. I feel that it'd probably be fairly easy to modify it to allow kids in wheelchairs to enjoy too.

My biggest problem with this place is the lack of comfortable seating. My child is old enough to not need vigilant supervision in places like this, so I'd planned to kill two hours here relaxing while my daughter burned energy, but the options are uncomfortable bar seats, uncomfortable foam blocks on the floor, or the best option, uncomfortable foam columns. Honestly, for this reason alone, it's a one and done for us.

Review: At least the last three times we have been here the last year has been a disappointment.  The area where you shoot balls out of the cannons, the volcano erupting launcher and the one that carries the balls up to the bucket to drop on everyone does not work. Every time I ask the personal if they can fix it. They say they will get right on it. A hour later, not fixed. Come back months later again and again.  Still not fixed. This place brings in alot of money and should be able to maintain there equipment.  My kids love this area of the playground to be met with disappointment.  At least close it off and give a discount to customers untill fixed. Not fair to pay full price for partial enjoyment of an attraction you are selling. I'll try one last time, let's a say in a month or two. I'll update or delete this review depending on your outcome of repairs.  Thanks.

Review: So dirty! It’s been 4-5 months since we’ve been here and what strikes you when you walk in is a horrible musty odor (despite the air freshener they installed at the entrance). All the toys/structures have a visible grime that wasn’t there before. Also there was visible dirt+old food on the carpet and within the play structure. To top it off- worker went on a smoke break and sat in front of the fan afterwards filling the front area with smoke smell. Also wondering why “flat bottom girls” was the musical choice. The play structure is super fun for my daughter and she loves meeting “friends,” but it was too gross for me. Bummer. I’ve included a before pic of the octopus compared with now :( hope they get a deep clean and add back better cleaning practices

Review: As a parent, this was a fun place to take my kiddos and hang out with a mom friend and her kid. It was a little dusty/dirty, but I noticed a few workers actively cleaning, which is essential to do while kids are playing, as they are messy! The rules are as enforced as I was hoping, but I think this is more on the parents than the staff. The rules clearly state to supervise you children. It’s not a free for all. I noticed many parents hardly paying attention, meanwhile me and couple others desperately trying to see their kids on the top part, which is harder to supervise. Maybe little security cams would help at least for the top portion. I wouldn’t be able to see them usually unless I took a picture or they came back down. The toddler area was clean and my littles used it a bit when smaller kids weren’t, as they are 2. It was great for my low muscle toned girl who needed a break from the big toys sometimes. And fun enough for her twin brother to join her there. Why there was a little tv in that area, I’m not sure, but seemed odd for a toddler area, but I got my kid away from it after a few minutes cuz we came to move! Bathroom is fairly clean, though it would be nice to have a smaller toilet since it is for kids and my kid is potty training.

But it didn’t feel like the workers wanted to be there very much. I assume typical high schoolers, but I couldn’t tell if there was a manager also present. Somebody needed to be in charge. I figured it’s just a job for them, but as an educator I would hope to have a little bit more enthusiasm for working with kids.

Review: This was an okay exterior my children. But I think the cleanliness can improve a little bit as there are children clearly eating in the toys because there are chip crums and such in the floor. The room is not too big do it also feels a little crowded. My kids loved the octopus. I would not recommend if you have a child who is anxious with people or hypersensitivity to sounds. My oldest refused to move from his seat so we weren't there long but that's not something I consider in the ranking as it's something personal. But I still think cleanliness can improve.

Review: I just wish the staff were more on top of keeping the bigger kids out of the 1-3 year old section. My 2 year old was so happy jumping on the trampoline for the first time. When 3 big probably 8 year old boys and girl came charging in and ran across the trampoline causing my 2 year old to fall off. one of the 8 year old tripped nearly landing on her and the other 8 year old trying not to trip over there friend almost stomped on my daughters head but instead just smashed her tiny little finger with his heel. Her fingers are black and blue for a week and she is now terrified of trampolines and bigger kids. I feel like this place should at most be 1-6 or because 8 9 10 year olds are huge and they get so amped up and forget that 1 2 3 years old are super tiny. Super bummed used to come here weekly and now my daughter starts to cry if she thinks that we are going there.

Review: The Littles played and played for hours. Take a lunch or snack and you can enjoy it still within the facility but off the play area when the Littles get hungry or thirsty. Just the right size for 5 yr olds on the main play area though some activities give a little challenge. Have areas for even younger. And some of the climbing and the plastic soft ball area will need some assistance or age skills. Birthday party prior was a blast. Recommend.

Review: Hi,
I had a very disappointing experience at WiggleWorks today. The listed closing time for Saturdays was 9:00 PM, so I arrived with my child at 7:30 PM expecting a full evening of play. However, I was surprised when the lights were turned off at 8:15 PM without any prior notice or communication from the staff.

When I asked about it, I was told the store doesn’t always follow the posted hours and may close early if the turnout is low. This felt unfair and frustrating—especially after paying the full weekend entry fee of $15 for what ended up being barely 45 minutes of playtime.

It would be helpful if early closures were clearly communicated at the entrance or online, so families can plan their visits accordingly. I hope the store can be more transparent and consistent moving forward. Thank you for taking this feedback seriously.

Not just the balloon rooms, but every corners had dust balls with lots of hair floating around. Everytime we go their, we catch a cold. (This is the third time, and not sure we will be going back…)

Also they charged weekend fee this Thursday because one of the districts was having a spring break. (Bellevue I believe)

Update- they cut the piece out so now your kid can just fly down the stairs. No stop. So I lowered my star rating as it’s more dangerous.

More pieces have weathered down and they have now not stopped 3 kids from being banned over abuse.

Review: I was hoping it would have improved BUT it keeps getting worse. Trash everywhere, balloon pit had only 7 balloons because the rest popped and the trash left in there. I picked it up because it is not good for babies to swallow the pieces. The floor mats are not only dirty but torn upward which continued to trip my grandson when he ran around. And the bathroom!! There was dried up poop on the floor and sink. That was it for me. I changed my grandson in the car. The place is filthy. Don’t bother bringing it up to the person working because he is a kid. Probably working a summer job and he was constantly on his phone. I almost purchased a month pass on my way there because I needed indoor places to take my grandson and sooo glad I did not do it. We are not going back ever. Filthy and disgusting.

Updated Jan 2025:
A couple of months ago, passing by this place, I had noticed the replacement pieces through the glass window. I visited the next day to check if the Improvements were real. They were either replaced or taped up. Employee at the desk was also blowing up balloons to refill the pit. She also cleaned and picked up the trash. Of course I had to come back a few more times for a more accurate update. And it  continued to get better. The bathroom also was clean.
After our latest visit, it was time to update. Thank you for repairing the issues.

That said, I went there today for the first time and it was SO DIRTY and so rundown. Everything had grime on it. Like years of accumulated dirt. My one year old kept picking up clumps of hair. There were also a lot of unsafe holes in the plastic covers. You could tell they have made some super cheap repairs with duct tape and electrical tape but I would not take my eyes off of any kid here. We won’t be coming back and won’t be recommending it until they do some serious cleaning and renovating.

Children’s museums, funtastic playtorium, trampoline parks, arena sports, pump it up Lynwood, etc…and they all do a great job entertaining 4-12 year olds, but for kids under four it can be dangerous or require close supervision.

So the approach Wiggle Works takes is a needed niche, but the owner has one foot in their business one foot out. They collect the income but don’t reinvest it into upkeep of the place. These are franchises. And this franchisee needs to sell the location to someone who will fix it up and keep it clean.

I used to be a franchisee of a chain restaurant. If you want this place to improve, let corporate know this location is being neglected!

Review: Great place if you like dirty surfaces and toys, and would like your child to get sick immediately within the next couple days due to all the other coughing and sneezing kids. There is 0 screening of kids or parents having illness, sanitizer only at entrance. Place is dirty, adults go into kids only areas, I can’t recommend this place.

Review: Outdated and not so clean, but also not very expensive at $10.99 + tax for one kid and one adult. I think if the weather outside is bad and you come when it's not busy, then it's not a bad price and will keep younger kids preoccupied for an hour or 2.

However, as the pictures from other reviewers show, the place is getting run down. I think the owners could do some basic stuff like vacuum the giant dust bunnies around the fans to improve the place even if they don't have the budget to get new equipment.

It does help too that the place is in a family friendly mall where there's also a library, food court and super market. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who isn't in the local area, but I'm glad it does exist as there's few indoor kids play options in Bellevue.

Review: I was extremely disappointed with my visit to WiggleWorks Kids. The place was dirty, and it feels like the owners haven't invested in updating the equipment for the past 10 years. The equipment looks old and worn out, which raises serious concerns about the safety of the children. I expected a much higher level of cleanliness and maintenance. Definitely do not recommend this place for a visit.

Review: The premise of this place is simple: pay a reasonable admission fee for all day long (come & go is allowed); big enough of a space to have kids run around, small enough to not be difficult on a parent to watch their kid. The place is not meant to wow the kids (or the parents), it’s just meant for parents to bring their kids and tire them out (oops, did I say tire them out? J.k. I mean, bring them to provide them with a safe space to work on their gross motor skills).

The place is designed so that a parent can sit on a stool and watch their kids play. Kids can eat food brought from outside, and eat it on the counter tables.

Every time I come I see that the parents are looking at their phones / working on their laptops/ chatting with other parents/ relaxing. There aren’t many places in which one can do that, so for that, this place gets 5 stars from me!

My only complaints are: 1) it could indeed be kept in better condition; 2) if you want to bring another parent costs extra; 3) some of the teens working here have a poor attitude (one teen in particular gets an annoyed look every time someone approaches, because it means he needs to get up, and stop looking at his phone); 4) WiggleWorks just recently updated their system so that now they show tipping options…seriously? Tipping for what?

Review: Do not go! There are so many better options within 10 mins drive of this place. 11$ for unlimited playtime seems like a great deal, and it would have been if the place was well run and clean. The play area looked great from the outside, however it is very dusty and dirty. Not great for babies who put things in their mouths. The equipment is visibly dirty too. We sent 3 hours there because we were on a playdate and I wasn't going to be rude and leave, I also payed to be there. I did see one staff member gentle wipe a few areas but not hard enough to actually clean anything.  As for the bathrooms hold your pee or leave because it was awful! The floors were sticky and gross. No paper towels in the bathroom or seat covers, the sink was covered in something suspicious as was the door handle to exit the bathroom. The staff tell you as you enter not to go on the rides, no problem however what they don't tell you is they include the climbing structure as a ride, so as I went up with my kids they threw a fit and were incredibly rude.  Will not be back.

The restrooms have change tables and toddler training seats. Only complaint is that it is a little small and is a bit dilapidated. You also have to pay twice ($11 x 2) if two parents are attending.

Review: The whole place is pretty poorly maintained and grubby. My kids, who had asked to go after seeing the shiny light up slide through the window, we're asking to go after about 30 minutes.

Everything was ripped, dirty, patched with duct tape, and extremely worn down, and the play area is not especially large. It's fine enough, until you consider the price. Many play areas across the greater Seattle area have *much* larger, well maintained play spaces for the same price point.

Review: Plus 1 star because my kid had fun for the most part.

Negative 4 stars because this place leaves a lot to be desired.
---When is the last time anyone cleaned this place?
---The fans have so much crud built up on them, and they blow directly on the children in the balloon area.
---Bandaids and popped balloons all over the place. Choking Hazard much???
---Trash cans areas are disgusting.
---Bathrooms have no paper towels and a door handle you must touch to open.
---Zero employee smiles. Zero welcoming gestures. Gloomy feeling vibe from the entire staff on June 10, 2023. Was I on the set the walking dead?
---*** 🤯 You get matching bracelets when you enter for kid/parent identification, but there are zero people actually checking when you leave. When I left with my kid, the employee took the bands and let us leave without checking them. They sure have created an illusion of safety, but it's exactly that... An illusion.  (the person who let me leave, was not the person who checked me in.) **Also, the person that checked me didn't even instruct me to put the band on the child, and said it was perfectly acceptable to just hold them, so the bands were never put on anybody. When I left, it was without confrontation and I left with a child that had no band (my child of course. But no one who works there would have known this.)

This was my first time at this establishment, and overall it was pretty disappointing.

Review: I’ve been 3 times with my 1-2 year old girl and had a blast every time. I certainly don’t share some of the concerns I’ve seen posted here about it being poorly maintained, unsafe or unsanitary. I mean, it’s a place where toddlers are invited to play and explore; it’s not in flawless condition, but any tears or rips I saw were appropriately repaired and certainly not unsafe. When I’ve been there the staff has been kind, helpful and attentive to their duties of cleaning and supervising the space. There can be a lot of unmasked kids here, so if you’re super concerned about your child’s risk of exposure to COVID or other infectious illnesses this probably isn’t the place for you. I don’t see the risk here being any greater than at daycare or any other indoor play space. The staff do a good job keeping things as clean as possible from what I’ve seen, but any time people and kids gather there will be some risk of getting sick. Overall we love this place and it will stay on our list of favorite rainy-day activities.

Review: I didn’t take many pictures, mostly videos of my two year old twins having a blast. One of them can’t walk unassisted and I was glad the surfaces were padded that she could fall unfazed. My son got a lot of energy out. Parents need to supervision better but that’s not really the staffs fault. I docked two stars because both staff members, I saw were inattentive and on their phones most of the time looking like they wished they were elsewhere. Cleaning and supervising the equipment is their job along with front desk duty, but it’s a kid place. Smile, greet the kids, act like you’re happy to be there 🫤… probably in high school. But there should be a manager visible as well, not just the one/two people at a time. Neither staff looked or acted like a manager.

Review: Three stars bc of food prices and it was hot! Overall better than your average kids play place.  We went when the price was low but the regular weekend prices are really high! I’m pretty picky and I was impressed with how clean it was, although there was mold on the drinking fountains and lot of dust (  I don’t understand why play places are designed with areas that are not accessible that just build up years and years of dust )  The staff were fantastic better than I expected very attentive and kind !  I appreciated that they actually enforce the rules.  My only complaint is that I foolishly thought that it would be easy for us to eat lunch there with three toddlers a six-year-old and myself with drinks but all getting only one food item it was almost 40 bucks !!!  Each kids drink is 2.50 and there are no refills. I had to buy Milk 2x each for my 1 1/2 year old twins. My  six-year-old got a mini pizza but I thought she could share with her brother but she ended up eating the whole thing herself and it was $11 !!  I got a Mediterranean wrap which was good and filling but it was just a small wrap with nothing else and it was eight or nine dollars . There are low cost snack options, but I wouldn’t buy beverages or eat a meal there unless you don’t mind the crazy cost 😬

Review: Disorganized, loud, and obnoxious... and that's the adults in the room. This place is a disaster. The adults let their kids run crazy and many of them are bullying the younger and littler kids. The adults don't care, because they get to drink their beer and let someone else manage the mess. And since nobody is really paying attention, it looks pretty easy for a child to be removed without anybody knowing. Not a place I'll be taking my children to any time soon.

Review: The play structure and facility is great, however, a couple of things really rubbed me the wrong way.
1) Beware surge pricing on any day without school. Price is $15 instead of $10.
2) Hate the giant TVs everywhere. If people need to watch TV they can do it on their phones.
3) Wish they had a designated separate area for parents to do their loud video/ phone calls away from the rest of us.
4) Website clearly says no outside food or drinks, so I didn't bring any. But other people very obviously ignored this, and it was a struggle to find anything on the menu my very picky kid would eat. I finally spent like $20 on undercooked very overpriced food that my daughter didn't even like, and while watching other people eat snacks they'd brought realized that following the rules is for suckers.

It was a bit crowded when we visited, but that’s expected on a Saturday. We stopped by during a getaway from out of state, and my child really enjoyed the break here ☕️

Review: This was a lovely experience. We went on a Sunday. Football and basketball were playing on the 2 screens in the food and tables area, Their menu options were limited but well balanced to please. The play structure was entertaining for a wide range of kids. I have nothing negative to say, but an improvement would be to have the doors not open unless you push/pull a mechanism at adult height. One of our children tested the doors a few times. He could get out, and we were attentive as we're all folks close to the door. Also the staff were super friendly. I mean, just wow, they were so nice, polite, happy, and upbeat. It was a joy talking to them.

They don’t stamp any hands to enter the play ground and no rules are told except they show a QR code to do a waiver but don’t ask any proof of it. Lots of tables but not a whole lot of parents to do while the kids play.

Review: Had My Sons Birthday Party there last week. we rented the 2 rooms for 2 hours. all in all the play area was pretty decent and does get very crowded. Pizza we ordered was good we got 6 refillable pitchers of soda, the Sprite was lacking the syrup so tasted like soda water but worse. Only bad experience i feel we had was our “Hosts” 2 girls, greeted us in the beginning and really never really seen them again.  i had to go ask someone else if they could change the Sprite out for another flavor or fix the machine and bring us new one but no one never did. Only time our “Hosts” showed up was when i was paying for the bill and she stood aside right next to the cashier waiting . I was gonna pay for everything in cash but they are a cashless company so i payed with my card which wasn’t a problem at all. But The Hosts that was missing pretty much the whole time we rented the room for had the nerve to say to me that she can take that cash for her tip… which rubbed me the wrong way. first off I’m a great tipper, I’m from vegas and do work off tips as well… but u have to remember still its based on service so i tipped her accordingly to the service i received from her (which was more than she deserved). She would have gotten a much bigger tip if she actually did something.🙄

As a place to play for the kids its was pretty good. But for large parties i wouldn’t recommend it.

Review: This place is disgusting and dusty. I felt gross and needed to shower after leaving. The structure felt unsafe in parts of the tunnels, sticky crusty handprints, dangerous capped, piping coming out of the ground. No pads on the cement beams that stick out that multiple kids ran into.. Inches of dust piled above your head. In the netting, in the crevices of the wall mold on the windows, and besides the filth, there was kegs, right next to the dance floor that had no music playing the electronic motion censored game doesn't work. Disorganized, tipped over and random boxes with inches of dust on them is the site you get to see when you were at the top level of the play structure.

Review: Our fault for going on a rainy day + holiday because it was crazy busy. The heat was cranked to the max, we were sweltering in there.  Our experience wasn’t the best and we left after 30 min. The majority of parents are not supervising their children and it’s just chaos. The ball launcher area is a war zone. Kids pelting you and others intentionally with the balls (not the intended purpose). The balls are squishy, but firm and it does hurt if one is thrown hard enough at you, esp at close range. The whole area was unsafe due to this and my child couldn’t play in there. He was terrified. If we ever do go back, it would have to be at an off time when hardly anyone is there. The employee who checked us in was friendly and the play structure is large and fun to navigate if you have the space to.

Food was great but for some reason took 45+ mins. I'm in the restaurant industry and I can only assume our order was slightly forgotten about or there wasn't enough hands in the kitchen.

Review: Hoping a one star review will get the attention of the owners or at least be a warning to others having a party here. The actual party and service were great. The reason for the one star review is their tipping system. When I went to cash out for the day the automatic tips that popped up were a percentage of the entire cost for the party (admission for 15 kids and the room etc). I'm all for tipping fairly but one hour of dropping food service did not warrant a 25% tip for the  cost of the whole thing. I clicked ""other"" to put in a custom tip and didn't realize it was a percentage vs a dollar amount. I tip on these machines very often and never has it had me enter a ""custom percentage"" All that to say I ended up getting charged $100 over my intended tip without my knowing it. I would've never realized this but happened to check my bank statement and saw I was way over charged for the party. I called PDX Play date and talked with a very kind manager who eventually said she could do nothing but would forward my complaint to the owners and to expect a call back and they never reached out. PDX Play date I would recommend you adjust your system to leave a custom dollar amount, not a percentage. This is very misleading as there is no final cost screen before your electronic signature. Also I will remove this review if your owners decide to reach out to me to try and reconcile this issue.

The play structure is very large (3 levels) and there is a separate space with air cannons to launch balls back and forth between teams. I really appreciated the little kids area reserved for those 3 and under to play and stay safe.

Everything looked in good condition (though a little warm). There was a lot of dust visible in the areas behind nets, but that wasn’t accessible.

Staff was very friendly. Looked like there were two birthday parties going on in side rooms.

We will be back.

There is a place for the toddlers to play safely. Some of the equipment is quite old and battered. And there was dust in some places. But despite that, we had fun. We were with two daughters, one was 3 years old and the other was 8 months old. There was something for everyone to do.

Review: The facility is very nice.   The staff does not monitor the playground.  As a parent, this could be a very fun outing if you supervise your children.  Unfortunately, some parents or grandparents drop off their kids and go have a beer.   Their kids act like kids who are raised by parents who don’t supervise them and instead go for a beer. You kids will meet very nice polite kids and they will meet others.  Supervise for the best experience.

They day of the party the staff member running the party room was so kind. She checked on us and helped keep us on track for cake. Because of that we were on time getting out of the party room for the next birthday. They also cleaned the room very well before we got in. 10/10 would recommend.
It was also a sunny day and they had the garage doors open it was nice and bright inside.

Review: Family friendly | Great events | 2hrs well spent

We are a big fan of this indoor play place. It is so well thought out. We have been here a few times including their Easter egg hunt. I highly recommend this place for young families.

This place is popular and for good reason. They have three big sand pits for kids to dig in for hours. Check their web to see if there is a waitlist. If they’re full, put your name on the waitlist and time when to head over. However, the person at the front desk said the wait is usually shorter.

The workers are friendly and helpful. There are cubbies to put your items. They also provide protective eyewear if your kid doesn’t want sand in their eyes. Otherwise, just bring yourselves! They provide all the tools to have fun in the sand. Everyone must be barefoot.

There is a small area in the very front near the entrance for babies to play. There is also a small snack and drink area. You can eat your packed lunch at the tables or feel free to buy some snacks and drinks from a self serve kiosk. They also sell some merchandise and toys. There are two family friendly bathrooms, but one is larger so if you have a stroller and/or a big family, you all can fit in that one. This large bathroom has a small toddler toilet, which is awesome when you’re potty training a little one. In the cabinet there are some diapers.

The workers periodically sweep the sand back in the pits. They keep the place clean and safe. It’s a great place!

Their Easter egg hunt was so much fun too. Probably the most fun and safe egg hunt I’ve ever been to because they limited the number of people attending each session. Everyone found tons of eggs everywhere, and three people found the three golden eggs for a prize! They brought out the Easter Bunny (looks like Peter Rabbit) and gave away a goodie bag before leaving. Worth it for $30.
We’ll be back next year for this event.

Review: Friendly check in staff, fun concept, but some factors made me decide not to come back. This was my first visit.

Very busy on a Sunday afternoon the environment is very humid and dusty.

You have tons of people who don’t watch their kids, who have illnesses, and who sit back and socialize. Parents taking up a ton of space in the seating area using computers etc  there’s not enough space for your kids to sit down and enjoy a snack and/or beverage in that area.

Some children are throwing and dumping sand on your kids.

The some of the toys aren’t in good condition. There was a metal rusted truck in the first sand pit and some toys missing pieces.

The last consideration is price, most indoor play facilities range from $12-16 this place is $18. Not a deal breaker, but on the higher end.

Review: It looks like a lot of fun.  However we didn’t get to play there.  I texted dig pdx and was told that today was open play, that no reservation was needed.  We showed up and we were turned away, pretty disappointing and especially for our 4 year old.  They need to just make it protocol to have reservations all the time.

We had our son's birthday party at DiG and it went so smoothly! When we arrived, Lindsay literally ran to meet us with a wagon to bring things inside.  Her attention to us and detail was very much appreciated. We would definitely recommend visiting or hosting a party here.

Review: My son’s party at Dig PDX was awesome from start to finish. The site rep Joanna was extremely helpful and easy going. She met me with a cart when I arrived and helped me load in and unpack my boxes. She was available throughout the party but gave us the space we needed to feel relaxed and enjoy our time, the perfect combination. Everything was clean and set up so nicely with the perfect amount of counter space for food and plenty of tables and chairs for seating. The space was thoroughly enjoyed by the birthday boy and all of the guests. The hardest part was pulling the kids out of the sand when the party was over. They would have gladly played all day! The investment was worth every penny and I would highly recommend Dig PDX for your next celebration!

Review: We finally made it to DiG! Our daughter absolutely loved it. Perfect for a rainy day, too. It’s such a thoughtfully set up place where kids can roam and explore safely. Plenty of space for grownups/caretakers to sit close by/let kids play on their own or join in with the sand play. I think any sensory seeker would love it here. The sand feels so good, it’s safe, it’s clean. Lots of toys already there do no kid is missing out. Most adults are attentive and mindful of keeping everyone safe and respecting space. I personally enjoyed that they have three different themed sandboxes - construction site, beach, and dinosaurs. Restrooms and food areas are clean/easily accessible. It’s great that you can bring food in or choose from a large variety of snacks/drinks. We were there for over an hour and our 3 year old didn’t get bored once, she could’ve stayed longer. Can’t wait to be back, thank you!

Review: the perfect place for a 4 year old birthday party. i was looking for something in between a toddler montessori toy play places and aggressive pre-teen trampoline parks - this hit the nail on the head. the kids can play for hours requiring little supervision while parents chat… and everyone (even the older kids) had a blast. the venue was clean and spacious and felt super comfortable for a group of 20 kids and their handlers.

my only suggestion would be to get another one of those chair digger machines for the building section. the only conflict we had during the party was kids fighting over the lone digger. i can’t blame them. it was super cool.

Review: As someone who despises sand, DiG PDX is the most tolerable sandpit I have ever brought my kids to! The facility is cleaned and maintained constantly, and it is such a sensory-friendly place for the kids to play, dig, and feel. The snack bar is both kid- and adult-friendly. With plenty of seating, you could probably work (or mindlessly scroll) for hours while your kids bury themselves in the cleanest sand ever.

I also love that they periodically have enriching events and parents night out sessions. I cannot recommend this place enough. So much tolerable fun!

Parents could hang out with each other, mingle and keep on eye on their kiddos at the same time. The kids were in a kid friendly, safe, confined space that made it low stress. Setting up was a breeze because the space is already so cute, all we needed was food and a few things for the tables (we did table clothes and paper creations for center pieces). Coordinating with the team at DiG was also super easy. Via email, phone, in person - they were great with it all. On the day of, Bettie was incredible!

I can't recommend DiG enough. Truly made the Birthday Party magical.

Review: I want to give this place 5/5 stars. My kids (1 and 3.5) had lots of fun and it satisfied my toddler’s need to dig. And there is also a small baby area with a fun activity center and soft play blocks. The space all looked great. But the moment we stepped in, it stank like a dirty locker room. And when I asked how often the sand is changed, the friendly person who worked there said that it hasn’t been changed since they opened six months ago, but she expects they may have to change it once a year. It just seems so gross. The sand is super soft and slightly damp but even so there is visible dust in the air, raising my concerns for my children’s lung health. There is clearly inadequate ventilation. Even so we will still come back on a rainy day because my kid is obsessed with digging, and they offer significant discounts for buying multi-visit passes.

Review: We brought our 2.5 year old here right when they opened at 9am and he had a blast! I like that they provide kid size safety glasses if the kiddos want to use them. The only downside we've noticed is that if you're not there right when they open (at least on a Friday or sunday) then their spots fill up VERY fast. And since there's not time limit on play time you never really know when a spot will open up. We drove from Vancouver so we made sure to get there at 9am. They have a big snack/eating area where you can bring your own snacks. And it's not a bad thing at all, but we noticed the sand is very cold on your bare feet when you first start playing lol over all our son loved it and we will go back!

Review: ** Updated ** Must Read**

Bettie, there was no signage placed around the building or parking lot the day of our visit. If this is a recent enhancement, your guests will certainly appreciate the improvement.

Since you brought up the email, allow me to set the record straight. I called LEKA asking for the owner to reach out. After sharing my story with your employee at LEKA, I was met with compassion, understanding, and acknowledgement that what me and my family went through at DigPDX was not appropriate for any customer. Given you’ve changed policy so much, they were very reassuring it could have been handled differently.

The employee took notes on my experience and my phone number and that she would have you call my mobile. Not email. Not by post. I was expecting a phone call. Was leaving my phone number with an employee too complex of a notion to follow through by phone? Was the expectation not clear?

On that same call I let the employee know I would wait one week before reaching out again knowing that an owner might be busy…running a business… the week in between was me being respectful of your time. More importantly, if I had known you were going to pull my husband’s email from our customer profile, I might have been monitoring the inbox. Again - effective communication is crucial. Thank you for bringing that up.

***Original Post***

Effective communication is crucial. I recognize the necessity for businesses to adapt their policies in response to factors such as demand, scale, and safety, and I fully respect their decisions.

However, the recent policy changes at DigPDX have occurred three times within the past six months, yet they have not been adequately communicated to customers. Regrettably, our family did not receive notification that Sunday hours now require reservations, resulting in an unexpected inconvenience.

Sadly, as my 4 and 2-year-old children were in tears, and my eldest asked, ""why do those babies get to stay and play?"" after eagerly entering the building, it was the owner, Bettie, who addressed us over the commotion. She explained the policy change, expressed that the establishment was at capacity, and regretfully informed us that no exceptions could be made.

After the incident, Bettie and I communicated via email. I'm sure she had the best of intentions, but this situation was handled very poorly. Simply posting a sign on the door stating ""Reservations only"" would have saved us a lot of trouble and time. Implementing policy changes requires proper change management, and I hope this feedback is considered for future adjustments to prevent other families from experiencing the same ordeal.

Review: We've been waiting for DiG to open since we first heard about it, almost a year ago.  And wow, we were not disappointed!  The walls are adorned with beautiful scenery; the sand is luxuriously soft (so soft!); facilities are clean and kid-friendly; and the staff are welcoming and helpful.  Most importantly, the kids had a blast exploring the different themed play spaces, and having access to a variety of sand toys.  Sensory play is so important for the littles, and it was fun to see them really get creative with it (and make some new friends in the process).

Like Leka, you can check the DiG website to see how busy they are at any given time.  There's a 35-kid safety limit, which I appreciate because over-crowded spaces can be stressful for us.  If the limit is reached, you can place yourself on a virtual waitlist.  Our days are typically pretty flexible and we live close-by, so this works out fine for us.  The big bonus here is that there's NO play time limit, and once admitted, we can come and go during the day as needed.  If you require the certainty of a scheduled session, I see on their website that reservations for 1.5 hour play sessions are an option for Sundays.

Someone had mentioned dust being a problem, but we didn't have any issue during our visit.  I thought it was considerate to provide kid-sized goggles by the cubbies at the front.

We cannot wait to return, and play on both rainy and sunny days.  Honestly, the sand here beats the beach!

Review: We had such a great experience at Kids Empire in Gresham, and Hailey was a big part of why! She was super friendly, patient with the kids, and kept the energy fun without it feeling chaotic. You can tell she really cares about creating a safe and welcoming space for families. The jump areas were clean, the layout made it easy to keep an eye on the kids, and Hailey went out of her way to make sure everyone was having a good time. If you visit, I hope Hailey’s working she really makes the place feel like more than just a bounce house. Definitely coming back!

Review: 6/21/25 Sat afternoon: first time at Kids Empire in Gresham and was very impressed❣️🤩🥰

Friendly staff, clean place, floor is clean & very organized. There's a tote to put the shoes in and  lockers available, too.

And there's more. The admission ticket is for an all-day pass!! You can leave and come back on the same day--keep your admission ticket! ❣️❣️😄

Safety: Staff monitor kids to ensure kids are playing/climbing equipment safely. 🤩

There's 3 sections: 1 section for small kids/toddlers on the side, the main section for kids/adults is in the middle section, and another side section to slide down the tube.

Food: snacks & drinks available. No hot food (no pizza, no hotdog, no fries, etc). The snack box $6.75 is a good deal! 🧃😋

There's 2 machines to win toys/plushie. You'll need to purchase the game card to play.

Motor circuit ride: You'll need to purchase the game card to activate the ride.

🚙 Free parking is shared on a lot with other stores and restaurants.

There are other stores and restaurants within walking distances!😋

💫💫 🩷 overall, it's a good location, a little spendy but worth it! Kids will love it! Highly recommended!! Will definitely come again 😄💫💫🩷😊

Review: Kids Empire is a truly fun experience for kids of all ages. Younger kids use their imagination to create a world within the play structure that keeps them occupied for hours. Older kids enjoy playing hide and seek or enjoying the soccer field. It's even fun as adults to go through with your children. Most areas are tall enough for adults and the slides are super fun as well. The facility itself is clean and welcoming. Hailey was super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this indoor play place for anyone looking to get their kids energy out or just enjoy a day with friends or make new friends. My only recommendation, as an adult, is if you are going to be staying for awhile reading, etc. to bring ear plugs or headphones :)

Review: We had my daughters 2 year birthday party here at the beginning of March and it was amazing! The space was PERFECT, I loved that the whole place was ours for the party, the owner was super accommodating and helpful, and it kept all the children (ages 6 months-5 years old) entertained for the two hours allotted. I can’t speak for the free play hours but I will recommend them to anyone planning a birthday party needing an indoor space. Our oldest is on the spectrum and it was the perfect size for keeping eyes on him so he didn’t elope!

Review: Dark, dirty, and grungy. Uneven floors that go from gym mat to concrete in what seems to be the baby area. Daughter got pretty sick a few days after visiting and not really going anywhere else before or after that week. Overall weird vibe with staff but they weren’t rude or anything. Price is good I guess if you’re desperate for an indoor play space and don’t have access to transportation.

Review: I rented the wiggle room for my daughter's birthday. We had the whole space to ourselves. There was good communication when I asked a question through email to the owner. During party there was a host on site if we needed anything. The space was plenty of room for our group of almost thirty people kids included. Kids were between 2-7 years old and it was appropriate for all of them.The play area is set up well so you're able to view kids at all times. I would highly recommend the location for a party. I definitely would used the space again myself!

Review: I came to the wiggle room for a party (friend of the parents) and my kid LOVED it there so we’re definitely going back! It was clean and organized and the host was absolutely lovely!!!! I think her name was Vee if im not mistaken; made the perfect bubbles to OJ ratio mimosa for me and was generally so helpful to everyone. My kid loved her too, kept stopping by to tell her the most random things LOL

Glad I went!

Review: We had a birthday here for our 2 year old.  It was a great spot for kid friends aged baby-4 year olds (and maybe older, this is just based on who we know).  Plenty of space for adults to sit and chat too. The space is open and naturally lit but cozy enough for singing Happy Birthday and with nooks for play.  Bring your own food (we had pizza from Sizzle Pie - nice discount - and fruit and dessert from the supermarket) and guests can get coffee drinks or alcohol at the bar.  10/10 would recommend.

Unlike many party places, they don't offer food and instead allow outside food, which opens up more options for party hosts.

If you’re looking for a place to host a birthday or just a dry place to play, I can’t recommend this place enough.

Review: The play area was great, the kids had a blast.  Smaller than expected though.  I am giving 2 stars because the staff was supposed to take all the stress out of the party and coordinate the timing for things but the lady there didn't help with any of that.  She just sat on her phone the whole time and then tried to start pushing us out 20 minutes before our 2 hours was up so she could clean and leave for the day.

Review: We have attended several playdates, and birthday parties at the Wiggle room and always love to suggest it to friends with the young toddlers. The owner is warm, and kind and made the thoughtful suggestion to order pizzas from the nearby shop to eat in house. There is a great selection of kid friendly, and adult beverages in house and on tap for refreshment during playtime. The play structure and craft areas are thoughtfully segmented and allow for parents to see their children play while they can sit and enjoy a break. Highly recommend this playspace for walking to school age toddlers and children.

Awesome price, super cute set up, very baby/toddler friendly, great vibe, attentive owners, and my son had fun! The bathrooms are equipped with wipes and diapers which I think is super awesome. Tons of toys and activities for little ones. The place is small, very small so it's great for younger kids. I actually like knowing my son won't be trampled on like he is at the park. We would come more often if we lived closer. 😊

1. Safety - there are very few rules, and all of them were broken every minute. The parents are either not present or are too busy with their electronic devices. Socks is a must, and more than half the kids were not using socks. The staff on duty was on her phone the entire time as well. Kids were injured as they stampede upon one another. There was constant crying.

2. The balloon pit had no balloons. All of the balloons have been shoved out of the pit, and no one cared to replace them.

3. Expensive. There are other playgrounds such as this, many of them are bigger. This is the most expensive that we have been to - $12+tax. The normal price for other places is $8.

Review: We should have checked the reviews on yelp before going to this place. We went here with our daughter and realized its the worst kids play ground in all of Seattle. Specially the lady at the front desk. She is rude as hell.

First of all its a very small place and we went on a weekday. It was completely empty and even then there was not much for daughter to do. I can imagine on weekends when there are more kids, how cramped it can get. For $12, its not worth it at all, even with a groupon for 9 bucks. I would rather spend $20 at Jumping Beans since its a much bigger place and so many things for the kids.

Second and the most important, the lady on the front desk is the worst and that resonates from other reviews as well. When we went there and told her that we have a groupon, she started telling us that we can use groupon only twice a month and how people cheat. Really, is this the thing you tell some one who come there for the first time. Then when my daughter started playing, she started bugging us for small things, that she can't do this and that. The last straw was, when I went in the back to heat up my daughters food, she came screaming at me, that you should ask me before using the microwave. I mean seriously, this is not the first playground I have taken my daughter to. She's that rude specially at a kids place. I would expect people running anything related to kids be calm and polite. And its not that I did something.

She is a troubled lady and needs help.

But any ways we won't be going to that place ever again.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!

For a kids place, they need to know how to treat people/children politelty.   Will never go back again.

Review: We’ve seen “Blippi” play here on his show and we live quite close so decided to visit! Wow were we disappointed!!!!
1. The front desk lady was friendly but taking pictures with a digital camera of her screen and cash she was counting (in front of several customers....) . And she also “sneakily” snapped a few photos of me and my sister...I mean.. it’s fine but kind of weird too?
2. She touched ALL of our small (non-mobile) babies hands, and asked to hold them. It just felt too involved and awkward since she IS a stranger. I know she was just being friendly but there is a line of appropriateness that was crossed I believe.
3. This place is FILTHY. Dust and hair on the ground. The structures were ALL falling apart and there were several balloons that had popped and the remains weren’t taken care of... hello dangerous!!!
4. For $24 (for 2 kids) I would expect a LOT more. My kids ran around and had fun which is great but I didn’t feel comfortable with the cleanliness or the broken structures. In the end I will NEVER be coming back or reccomending it to anyone. There are other indoor play places that take cleanliness and safety seriously... go to those and DO NOT go to this place.

Review: I've been coming to this place with my 2 kids since it opened and changed management, and the quality of the rides and cleanliness was always very good. But today, the alergia because of the dust are really bad, the floor is dirty, the toilette  wasn't flushing and you can see the dirt and lack of maintenance of the rides. My kids love the place, but I have to be responsible with them and think twice if we will be back.

Review: We love GiggleJungle and will be returning. The children kept removing the balloons from the fan area and taking them down the slide. However, the lady working today between 3-410pm refused to get up and take action.  She said the balloons should end up back there in a few minutes.
10 minutes later she remained at her desk without taking action.
We never had this problem at Wiggleworks.
We will be returning here and appreciate the management’s opinion on this matter.

Review: Today I went to this facility for the second time. I went with my two year old son and my two friends, who both have 1.5 year old babies.
Our kids play together all the time and are all friends.
When we came in, the receptionist was on her personal cell phone and said we can pay after she gets off the phone. We proceeded to enter and our kids to play.

35 minutes into the time we were there, my son (2 years old) was playing and wrestling with his friends. We, the moms were monitoring. Taking photos and laughing.
At one point another girl who we did not know came to play, and my son threw an air balloon at her. Yes, air inflated balloon. I automatically turned to her mom to apologize and went to my son. The mom said no worries.

As I am approaching my son, the same receptionist, ""Claudia"" yanks his hand and tried to get him off the play area. I was two steps away and mid movement told her to not touch my son. She started yelling that my son is too aggressive and needs to leave. I explained that she needs to approach me and not touch my child. She continued to yell and berate me that my son was causing havoc and that she was calling security on the both of us. Yes, my 2 year old.

The mom of the girl automatically stepped in as did both my friends and the manager said that we all had to leave and called security.

We complied, got ready and left. Met security outside and he apologized for what happened.

Fast forward to 20 minutes later. I realize I left my wallet at this ""kid facility"". I called and a guy answered. He said they had no wallet. I knew where I left my wallet and returned there. I asked for my wallet and again both Claudia and this gentlemen told me that my wallet was not there. While all this was happening, a woman turns to both Claudia and the guy and says "" why are you lying, I just handed you a wallet"". Both looked dumbfounded and confused and I threatened to call 911. Seconds later my wallet was returned to me.

Never returning to this place. Also forgot to mention. We told Claudia that there were rocks in the play are and asked to vacuum. She ignored that request.

Review: ****BEWARE!!  NEVER EVER PARTY AT GIGGLE JUNGLE!!!!

First of all a big Thanks to Giggle Jungle, for their ruthless courtesy towards our guests in the event.

*I booked the event here only after they agreed upon for decoration. Here is the below confirmation from you upon registration.  ""Minions theme decoration, dark blue/yellow colors, balloons. Wall decoration and happy birthday banner with name"" . Shockingly just one day before, that too when I went to them and asked about the arrangements, that time I got to know that no decoration is provided. This made me not to change the event in the last minute.

*Wiggle Works which is in Cross Roads, Bellevue have much better ambiance, space and more fun activities is providing the same service for just $129 on weekdays. When I asked the same question during the booking, the reply I got from their staff is that they are providing the decoration which costs more and hence $199. But this decoration has never happened.

*Before starting of the party they never told us that they have hard stop at 8PM. But they just came to us 10 mins before 8 and forced us leave immediately.

*I asked for yellow and Blue combination of plates and table covers but when the party is about to start you provided us only yellow items. I went out to get the decoration and other table covers which killed almost 30 mins of my time.

*Last but not the least, they said so many policies about your GJ/RTC and forced us to vacate the place by 8:15 but still charged us $50 for the additional time.  After I sent this feedback they returned me $50 back but that is other side of the story.

Review: What a gem! My 3 YO absolutely loves this place. We have been twice and asked every other day if we can go, lol. Great downtown location. It reminds me of a play cafe without the food. They have a ton of different play zones- a sensory area (baby/toddler friendly), grocery market, pizza place, bakery/coffee shop, sandbox, train table, builder station with dump truck, car garage, vet center, and baby/house. Everything is cleaned and organized for the next play group. Sessions are 1.5 hours and $15. Staff are incredibly sweet and even played with the kids. And at the end they give the kids a snack. We will also def be using for bday parties. Socks are a requirement, althoufh they (and I) reccomend littles wear grippy socks as the floors are concrete.

I have 2 recommendations. 1) some sort of stamp or bracelet system to secure who children can leave with, similar to chuckee cheese. And 2) espresso/coffee bar for the parents lol.

Review: Super fun! I took my one year old today and she had a blast with the shopping carts. Overall a great experience and the staff member was kind and helpful!

I have one other comment to add and this is meant to be constructive; not at all meant to be negative in any way! I am very sensitive to smells and the fabuloso overwhelmed my system. I think either it may need to be way more diluted or replaced with something non fragranced. I left with a headache and irritated throat from the intense fragrance so I can’t imagine how the littles feel! We left and my girl was chugging water with me :/ I know a lot of people are sensitive to that stuff including myself and my step son with asthma too - so I just wanted to mention that a simple switch might make the environment a lot healthier and inviting for people with asthma/allergies/sensitivity.

Other than that we had a blast and she was just enamored with all the toys!

Review: I recently visited Mimi’s Playhouse with my little ones, and we had the most wonderful experience! From the moment we walked in, Martinique was welcoming and friendly, making us feel right at home. The play area itself is clean, bright, and incredibly safe—perfect for toddlers and young kids to explore.

There’s something for every age group, from soft play structures to interactive stations that stimulate creativity. The kids loved exploring the various play options, and there was even a section for babies to enjoy, which I thought was a thoughtful touch.

We also hosted a birthday party here, and it was absolutely top-notch. Martinique made the event so easy and stress-free for us, while the kids had a fantastic time.

The space is well-organized, with plenty of seating for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The bathrooms were clean, and the whole environment had a pleasant, well-maintained feel.

Overall, I couldn’t be happier with our experience. It’s the perfect place for kids to burn off some energy while giving parents a break. The birthday party experience was seamless, and I would absolutely recommend Mimi’s playhouse for any special occasion. We’ll definitely be back!

Since kids nap 1~3PM, practically speaking once they eat after the nap, etc. if you guys close at 5:30, there's no window to come in for the afternoon. We end p only come for the morning.

Review: TL;DR: Not for parents who value screen-free, hands-on, creative play and care about noise/visual overstimulation after the 1/16/2025 remodel.

2 stars after the remodel (was 4 stars before).

We used to love this place. On rainy days, my 3-year-old would climb, build with foam blocks, and enjoy pretend play with wooden toys. The slide and toolset were his absolute favorites—he could spend hours happily exploring and playing. It was a calm, clean, and comfortable space that gave us both a much-needed break. I’d join in the play or just relax while he explored.

But things changed after the remodel (1/16/2025). They added a huge, loud, blinking video game with sound effects and background music that fill the entire space. Instead of pretend play and climbing, some kids now just stand in front of the screen, cracking blocks endlessly—crack, crack, crack, bump, bump, bump, explode, explode. To make it worse, the game changes themes every few minutes, constantly drawing kids back for more.

The game does have an auto-shutdown feature: if no one plays it for a while, it will turn off for 10 minutes. But with so many kids attracted to it, that rarely happens.

My kiddo didn’t even touch the game, but the noise and flashing lights were impossible to avoid. He couldn’t concentrate on the slide, the toolset, or any of the other toys he used to love. By the time we left, he (and even I) was overstimulated and overtired. It was exhausting for both of us.

The staff was nice enough to lower the volume a bit and promptly refunded my pass when I asked. I appreciate their help, but the experience left me feeling disappointed. This used to be such a pleasant space for creative, hands-on play, and now it’s a struggle to find something similar for rainy days.

If they ever remove the video game or limit its impact, I’d gladly come back. If you feel the same, please consider leaving a review. Hopefully, they’ll see how much their choices affect families like ours and make some changes.

Review: November 2024 Edit:
We’ve been back a few times to this indoor space and have seen several positive improvements. They no longer seem to allow strollers in the play area, which opens up the space considerably. There are an ever-increasing number of toys and play options, many of which are quite unique and fun for a variety of ages (my now three year old loves the hamster wheel and jumparoo in particular). There are no longer schedules play sessions, your time (one or two hour increments) starts when you arrive. It has been very clean each time we’ve been there. It continues to be an excellent play space for small toddlers, and they have several class options for older kids. We love this play space more and more each visit, especially as the weather starts to change.

We’ve been eagerly waiting for this place to open, there are few indoor play spots for toddlers in this area! We booked a play spot for my 2.5 year old on opening day for the standard price of $30. My child happily and safely played for the entire two hour session. I supervised and played along, but never had to intervene or redirect.

General Observations:
-Although targeted at ages 8 and under, this is designed for the preschool and under set. If you have a young toddler and fear other places where bigger kids run them over, this is a great spot. At 2.5 years, my child was one of the older children there. There was only one child over four in our play session today and they were obviously bored after 20 minutes and complaining about all the “babies”.
-There are few toys. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it means that if one kid cleans out the “kitchen” area and moves everything to the “store” area, there are literally no toys left in the kitchen area. Since the staff doesn’t clean between sessions, the “store” isn’t restocked until another child moves stuff back. There were like five dress up outfits total.
-It’s expensive, but Redmond is expensive in general. I don’t think it’s outlandishly priced, but it’s pricier than KidsQuest on a per-visit basis (and MUCH higher membership and party fees) with far less space. I can’t fathom paying $60 for two children to play in this small space.
-the advertised play space of 3k feet is a bit misleading. There’s a big party room, spacious family bathrooms, and a staff area included in the square footage.

What I Love:
-Great play options for preschool and under
-Limited sensory overload - classical music is playing softly, colors are muted, there’s not an overwhelming number of choices for littles.
-climbing area is FANTASTIC. Lots of challenging options with safe landings.
-Two hour play window is perfect for littles.
-The play space is self enclosed and everything is safe for littles. If you want to let your kid roam freely without constantly hovering, this is the perfect space. I imagine it’s perfect for weekday play dates while parents drink coffee and chat.

What I Didn’t Love:
-Play spots are back-to-back. Staff does not clean, sanitize, or organize between sessions like in other similar indoor play places.
-Strollers are allowed in the play space. It’s a small and tight space, and shoes aren’t allowed. However, multiple strollers were in the play space during our season, which made the area seem super cramped. Kids were running into each other and said strollers. It kind of defeats the no shoes rule, since the stroller tires track dirt and germs everywhere.
-Play areas seem incomplete. This might change, given it was opening day. There were five total dress up outfits. A cool ball maze on the wall was missing any balls to drop down it (so the toddlers dropped blocks, which led to obvious problems). The cash register in the grocery store was to small and not secured, and I watched several toddlers swing it around and drop it on other kids’ feet.

We’ll be back occasionally on rainy days when local play options are limited.

🌟 Low-risk play but still provides challenges (with soft landings!!)
🌟 It’s all enclosed and the sight lines are much better than a lot of other indoor play places
🌟 Crafts and sensory activities are available for free during open play when classes aren’t in session
🌟 Lots of soft places to sit for caregivers
🌟 Clean, lots of windows for natural light
🌟 My 3 year old was so engaged and had so much fun here!! My boys would’ve been on the older end but I know where they would’ve been playing!

Review: We recently threw a birthday party for our daughter who just turned 4 at Kids Magic Lab, and it was such a great choice! After doing a ton of research on different venues, I’m so glad we went with this one. My daughter and her friends had the best time. The kids ranged from 9 months to 6 years old, both boys and girls, and there was something fun for everyone.

They had so many pretend play options, tons of costumes that the kids loved, and a small gym area that was a huge hit. Here are a few things we really liked about the place:

1. Outside catering allowed: This was a big plus because it gave us full control over the food we wanted to serve. Super flexible!
2. Exclusive booking: You can book the entire place, which was perfect for a more intimate party. There's a play area and a separate party room. We had around 50 guests (20 kids and 30 adults), and the party room space was just right for our group.
3. Kid-friendly setup: The space isn’t too big, so parents didn’t feel like they had to constantly chase after their kids. It made it so much easier to relax and chat with other parents without worrying about keeping an eye on the little ones.
4. Decorations included: Their party package comes with basic decorations, which was a nice bonus! I requested a pastel color palette, and they totally nailed it.
5. Great location: Kids Magic Lab is in Redmond Town Center, which is a perfect spot if you want to keep the fun going after the party! After our 2-hour booking, the kids still had energy, so they continued playing at the nearby splash pad. Plus, there’s plenty of parking, which was super convenient.

Overall, we had a great experience with the staff too. They were really responsive via email and helpful throughout. The only thing I would mention is that while the website says the party package includes “paper goods” and “party helpers for setup and cleanup,” they actually charge an additional $50 for supplies and cleanup. It would've been nice if that was more upfront, but other than that, no complaints!

If you're looking for a fun, stress-free party spot for young kids, I highly recommend Kids Magic Lab!

Review: Kids Magic Lab is, regrettably, a disappointment given its inflated pricing. The offerings are sparse, especially when compared to the more affordable and abundantly equipped Children’s Museum in Bellevue. However, what truly compelled me to reconsider patronage was witnessing an interaction between the owner and an employee that was not only unprofessional but shockingly demeaning—behavior that one wouldn’t even direct towards a pet, let alone a fellow human being. This inappropriate conduct has been my main take away.

Review: I recently sent my 5-year-old son to Kids Magic Lab summer camp as a backup care for the first time. After 3-day attendance, it now becomes his top 1 backup care place! This place opened in summer 2024 thus all equipments in the play area are brand new and super clean. It has large windows and bright play space. My boy likes the big slide. Additionally, there are some unique setup like STEM wall, mini supermarket, farm and hospital, which we did not find in other similar business we've been to. More importantly, their summer camp session has good curriculum. I am impressed by my son's art on human's blood circulation and solar systems. They can also hold private birthday party and I booked one slot for my son after learning his joyful experience there. Overall, I think that it is a decent place for kids to learn and play.

Review: I took my 3-year-old son here for both an art class and free play time. He really enjoyed both! The art teacher was really great with him even though he tends to be kind of shy at first. She was very good with kids and within a couple minutes he was talking to her which I was very impressed by. He really enjoyed the project and then they had different art stations opened for him to explore after he was done with the main project. Afterwards we went out to the playground area where he played for about another hour. There were lots of awesome options for him to choose from without it being too overwhelming. I was both able to play with him and he was able to play by himself when I needed a little break. We will definitely be coming back here. I'm so glad to have another option on the area to be able to come and play at!

The only concern is 1st the floor is hard floor and when my 16-month-old baby felt hurt his head. 2nd BIG CONCERN when we arrived at 3:05 at the place they said at 4pm they have a “Birthday event” and we need to leave by that time + charged me for an hour. The website didn't show that they have event and they are open to public till 4 pm. Super unfair to other people. I drove 45 min for that place.

Review: My son absolutely loves Bonkerz!
I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: I've been coming here with my kids for years. It's the only free option for the winter when it's cold and/or raining outside.  Unfortunately this place is very gross and disgusting... The upholstery has tears/rips on them. In some places they have placed duct tape over the tears. The carpet is stained and nasty. Doesn't look like it's been cleaned in years. Every single play toy is falling apart, has cracked chipped paint, and there is an odor of old urine lingering around/on the play toys. Gross!!!!!

Review: Not a mall person at all, but an indoor playground is such a great thing to have nearby! Sometimes it's crowded, sometimes it's empty. Most of the time parents are good about supervising their kids; sometimes there are kids that are well beyond the height limit and they can get a bit wild/rough for the little ones. But I'd say 9 times out of 10, it's a great option to get some energy out on a wet day.

Review: Every time I take my daughter here there are kids too tall or old that are running around in here, either knocking down the younger/smaller kids or making it impossible for toddlers of any age to actually play. They hog the slides by either staying on them, going up them backwards or pushing past the smaller/younger kids. Asked security guard about it and was told there was nothing they could do about it.

Parents either ignore the sign that says ""if you're under this height come on in"" or they don't care, usually on their phones ignoring their kids as they push the younger children around.

Review: Gosh we use to love this place. The last two times have just killed it. Last time the staff member was in the playground rolling around with the kids and acting as their care giver. I was clearly watching her every move. It felt super inappropriate. She was all up in my kids and someone else’s kids face and it felt ick. We left after that went on for about 30 minutes. The second bad experience was a lady came in hacking up a lung and her poor kid had the worst flemy cough you can imagine. Couldn’t hardly breathe between coughs.  Not covering her mouth at all ( she was like 4 so that’s to be expected) her nose is was running all down her face. I approached the staff and asked if they typically allow super sick individuals to come in to play? She just shrugged her shoulders and said “yep” and here we are a week later and my entire household is sick. Sadly we won’t be going back there. This place needs to get their staffing and rules figured out. It’s a mess.

Review: Hosted our 4 year olds birthday party here and would 10/10 recommend. We had around 15 kids ages 6 months-8years old and about 20 adults. Everyone fit wonderfully and the kids had a blast, we rented the entire place out and the price was very reasonable (around $350 for 2 hours plus pizza). Our party host on Sunday 5/7 was awesome to work with and dealt with the kids amazingly, she was stern but friendly with their rules to the kiddos preventing me from having to yell at anyone and was helpful and friendly to all of the adults. My only gripe was I wish our rental could have been a  bit longer without having to book an entire extra 2 hours for double the price. I loved getting to decorate and make it special for my daughter without having to deal with a ton of cleanup prep and post party mess. Thank you!

Review: Such an awful experience solely due to the staff member (bigger lady with dark complexion), which is really unfortunate. We’ve always enjoyed taking our kids here, even have had a birthday party previously. But this time was just so terrible that we will never return or support this business.
I booked a party several weeks prior to our event, including paying a deposit, with this particular staff member. She explained the details of what was included…though NEVER informed us about additional fees for extra kids, not even how many kids they allowed before they would start charging, didn’t say the cost of each additional pizza, and didn’t say the kids weren’t allowed to play during pizza time.
The day before the event, I called to order extra pizza…to learn the woman never actually scheduled my event, despite the deposit I had made. Luckily they were still able to schedule it, but they never took accountability for THEIR mistake and just said “sorry about the confusion” (Ummmm there’s no confusion, YOUR staff member didn’t schedule our party).
During the event, the same woman was so rude to our attendees including the kids. She then ended up charging us about $100 OVER than what she initially quoted. When my husband expressed his disappointment, the woman LAUGHED at him and said “sorry you feel that way”.
This woman should find another job that isn’t in the customer service field or anything that has to do with children. So because of her, we will never return to this business. As other reviewers have stated, book your party elsewhere.

Review: An introverts nightmare, this place is exactly what it looks like. Great place for a kids birthday party. Especially when the weather is unpredictable. Nice staff, clean place, plenty of indoor fun for the kids. Lots of safe active indoor climbing equipment and slides, nice safe area for 2 and unders to play away from the bigger kids. Party room was clean and plates and flatware provided. Fridge and freezer in the room to keep the ice cream cold.

The staff was very friendly and took COVID-19 protocols seriously, which was extra nice given that my wife has autoimmune issues and just being there was a big risk for us. The place was very clean, and staff was very accommodating. I will certainly be taking the kids back there more often when the pandemic is over!

Review: I just left this place with a screaming and sad toddler. Parents don’t watch their kids and there are older children there bullying the younger ones. Several times my child was crying because of being pushed out of the way for something an older child wanted and parents did NOTHING. Staff doesn’t make parents watch their children. Very sad we came all the way from Spokane for my toddler to be pushed around by 7 year olds. There needs to be some parental accountability requirement here. Ridiculous.

Review: My 2 granddaughters (2 & 2.5) loved it! We got there when they opened so it wasn't very crowded at all. The way it's set up, I felt very comfortable bringing 2 toddlers by myself. There is plenty of room to play. They do have a few snacks and drinks. I paid for an hour ($11 each, I was free), and it was worth every penny. One of the things I did notice was that there was no musty smell like other kids' place that you go. I'm sure as the day goes on, it may, but it was very apparent they do a lot of cleaning!

Review: Experience the world of soft play, where kids can play in a safe environment with soft surfaces and equipment. Northwest Soft Play center in Post Falls is a great space for all ages, but is primarily focused towards the younger crowd. The ideal age for this center would be 8 months- 4yo, though you can bring kids up to 8yo.

Everything is soft, fun and safe for all ages. There is no sharp edges, bark or metal bars. The floor, stairs, and toys are all soft play based & geared towards toddlers. Soft play environments allow your child to gain confidence in their exploring while being safe!

You will find activities that include a ball pit, slides, a soft play castle, bouncy animals, interactive toys, rotating soft octopus, and lots more. There is also a small space for children that are crawling to explore & play. MUST WEAR SOCKS at all times.

Review: Went a couple days ago it was our first time. I wish I have read the reviews before going. The lady that ran the front desk was super cold, when we first got there it took her a while to even acknowledge us, she just kept chatting away with some women not even saying hi or anything. I like wow what great service. When I was filling out the form I had to ask her for the time a few times over because she over there taking selfies . I believe a business should be more welcoming and professional at least. Then the fact you get charge for a baby who isn’t even going to play , my baby sat on my lap the whole time just like I said she would but the lady charged her anyway saying just in case she wants to play . We definitely won’t be going again, I don’t like businesses that make you feel like an inconvenience.

Review: If I could give this place zero stars I would..

This business got new owners in August 2024. We've also been 3 times since the new owners. All 3 for birthday parties, one in August 2023, once in January 2024 and once in March 2024 and all 3 visits we have come home with either pink eye or hand foot and mouth, or this last time, March 2024 we got both pink eye and hand foot and mouth. My kids wear socks and I sanitize their hands multiple times as well as wash with soap multiple times during playing and after we leave. I don't believe that they sanitize this structure at all.

Jokes on us for coming all 3 times that we have, but we will not be giving this business our time or money anymore..  we had thought it was weird the last two time we came home with pink eye or hand foot and mouth, but we had also been to a couple other kids places but this time. We are in a move and hadn’t gone anywhere other than the grocery store in 12 days before we went here for a party, so we know without a doubt that it came from this business.. and our pediatrician has also mentioned that several cases of this has come in since August with a lot of them having frequented this play area shortly before…

Mind you, we went 5-7 times from April- July when we first moved here because they had discount Tuesdays, where it was half off on Tuesday, and we had never gotten anything from this place besides a stuffy nose which is common when taking toddlers to a play area.. but the fact that we've gotten pink eye and hand foot and mouth twice now in 6 months is unacceptable...

The joke of the pricing at this business since the new owners have taken over in August 2020 is laughable. They just released their ""summer savings"" and it's $250 per child to go for ONE HOUR A DAY for a SINGLE MONTH. Who is the freaking economy can afford that, if they have more than one child... and that's just the LOWEST TEIR of their supposed ""savings""  this place is a disgusting joke and I wouldn't waste your money.

It sucks you have to pay for extra adults, even though they aren't playing.
The ball pit is also disgusting and I'm certain they don't clean it very often, as there's old strands of hair and some of the balls are all oily. There's just a buildup of old grime and dirt in the ball pit, my daughter actually got really sick after going there.
We got cute pictures though

Review: If I could give the new owners of Northwest Softplay 0 stars, I would. I’m a huge supporter of small businesses but these people are nuts. When given feedback publicly via facebook , they immediately delete and block anyone who doesn’t agree with them.  They are curt and rude upon entry and definitely aren’t in this for the kids. I wish the old owners would come back because they at least ran the business for the kids and not for the money😭

They close down the ENTIRE place for birthday parties, which end up being pretty much every weekend, and won’t let in anyone who isn’t with the party. They post on Instagram and Facebook when they will be closed, but if you are not in social media you are SOL. Just take your kids to We Play, 20 minutes down the road. They have more things to do, and are better set up to handle birthday parties so nobody is left out.

Review: This is the only business I have ever seen charging people for waiting in the lobby. They wanted to charge me $3 for watching as my wife chaperoned our 3-year-old around the play area. Ridiculous.

Review: This is a great place to bring your littles! The facility includes climbing structures, ball pits, slides, ride-on toys, a baby/toddler area, kid-friendly restrooms, and plenty of hand sanitizer available to help keep things clean... it's small enough to not be overwhelming and it's easy to keep track of the kiddos. We had our daughter's birthday party here. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Lots of fun! Will be coming back.

Review: I took my son here for the first time today, and he absolutely LOVED it. I originally paid for an hour but since he still wanted to have more fun, I paid an additional half hour for him to keep enjoying himself. This option is fantastic, because an extra hour would’ve been too long for myself to handle. The pricing is well within reason, the piano smelled of stinky feet but other than that everything seemed cleaned. I’m 7 1/2 months pregnant and was able to help my 2 year old get around fairly easy. He of course has way more energy than I do, so I’m more exhausted than he is. I highly recommend this for any family with young children from infant to 5 years. There is a bathroom specifically for little kids, and a separate one for adults, and concession for snacks and drinks, as well as a water fountain in case your child gets thirsty while playing. Even better, there are step stools for your littles to use. I have nothing but good things to say about this place, don’t miss out on this little gem.

I would recommend anyone who wants to celebrate their children's birthday at soft play. Seriously, Macie definitely made sure she was always making sure we were good and the end as most birthday parties was a little bit of a mess and she insisted that we were to okay to leave even though we tried to do it ourselves. Thanks so much soft play for such a wonderful experience.

Review: We went to try this place out for the first time today, my daughter was playing up in the jungle gym area, and slipped off of the balance beam and her leg fell through the netting and she got stuck. I ran to try and pull her out she was screaming I tried to pull her out but she was still stuck. We were both screaming for help, not a single staff was to be found. Luckily a grandma and another lady came running over trying to help, she was too stuck we couldn't get her leg to budge. So we ended up having to cut the net finally after 10 minutes of my daughter being stuck a staff who was only a teenager come over but instead of helping she just stood there despite us asking multiple time for her to get scissors. Finally the other mom came running with the scissors and cut my daughter out. Staff never once apologized or even approached me. An older staff what I would assume was a manager was called and when she arrived she also did not even approach me or say anything instead they were just freaking out about having to now repaired the netting. My daughters leg is extremely bruised.

So many age appropriate toys for her to play with, I was nervous going in alone with my daughter because I wasn’t sure what to expect. But we were immediately greeted and helped right away so that put me at ease, and even the community in there, everyone was so nice. I was just so happy to get my girl out and socializing with kids her age. And the drinks were an added bonus for this momma! I can tell the owner is passionate about her business and we can’t wait to visit again this week! 🤍

My son actually cries every time its time to leave cause he just wants to keep playing, he loves it so much
And it's a perfect place for parents too since they have a cafe you can get your caffeine fix that most parents desperately need to be able to keep up with their little ones and you can enjoy your coffee and relax knowing that your little one is safe in an enclosed space and that you can watch them play from all sides
So parents can get the small break that they so desperately need lol
Highly recommend other parents to try this place out for their little ones
And all the staff is super friendly 10/10 customer service

One of the workers was acting like this is a museum where things are for display only and not a play area for children picking up toys every 5 minutes after the kids. We also walked into the play area with shoes on a few times to check on our kids and she would run in after us mopping and sanitizing. Don’t get me wrong we are clean people and love a clean tidy area but this was next level making us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. I did not like the atmosphere or the customer service and will definitely not be back.

We got there early (9:30 Saturday) when there was only two other children and when there were about 20 others (11am), it got a bit crowded but it was our nap time anyway anyways. In the almost 2 hours we were there, staff cleaned up several times, which was reassuring. Drinks were great and I’m excited to try some food next time. Definitely coming back and getting a five pack of play passes!

Review: 5 stars due to a few factors :
- We’re a member and our 2 year daughter loves it!!! They keep brining new toys so it’s not boring
- someone keeps sanitizing and cleaning up the places, so the place is definitely neater for the number of kids you see
- this is the only place I’ve seen where their cafe aspect and the play aspect is great. We parents have a place to sit down and enjoy their bomb drinks like falooda and Dubai chocolate latte while the kiddos have fun
- I particularly liked that they have a dedicated space for kids <2 so it’s safer
- we hosted my daughters birthday party during the weekend (VIP BASH) and couldn’t have been happier. While the venue charge is slightly higher than what you see other places,I would say it’s 100% worth it because - you get the entire place to yourself and your party, we had kiddos from 2-8 everyone enjoyed equally, it’s athletically pleasing place so decors fit very well, kids get free ice cream tickets and they loved it!! Also most guests tried their Falooda and left great reviews
Overall, worth it!!

My only feedback is that they conduct events (like Blueey and Easter) and I wish it would be free of charge for members. If not, we tend to double pay. Otherwise, this place is awesome!! Recommend it for frequent use as well as parties!

It makes zero sense to pay that amount when I could buy something permanent at home for far less.

I was in need of some caffeine and found this spot nearby but I’ll be back with my daughter again. They’ve got a good amount of options for their cafe menu and I really enjoyed my drink which was a special option that day.
While I drank my iced coffee, I watched the kids play while their parents drank and watched. The place is clean and has plenty of options for the kids to enjoy for some time. Also, they have made it safe for the kids too, so you don’t have to be with the kids at all times. I’ll definitely be back for another drink and snack, but with my family next time.

Review: Visited for the first time today. Cute place! Can definitely see the owners put a lot of effort into this place. Cute cafe with lots of snack options. My only complaint is OTHER PARENTS. Alot of non english speaking families not watching their kids, had my 1 year old punched by a much larger boy with no parent in sight. Kids hoarding toys or not letting smaller children access to certain areas and parents just ignoring their kids all together. 2 and under area not enforced so no safe space for babies. Wont be back.

Review: It’s alright — cute, but small play area for littles. $14 per kid is too much imo for an indoor playground like McDonalds. They even charge for infant 6mo and older.

Also, the owner uses a couple of tables for herself and it made us feel a little awkward. Seemed like a lot of paying customers had to stand around. Owner seemed to be caught up chit chatting w her friend and baby while the barista was obviously swamped. Not a good look.

Maybe if the owner was helpful, the barista would’ve had time to clean the play area.

Review: As a mom of two little girls ages 3 & 4, I know how impossible it is to find a clean & “young kid” friendly place where my girls can go play without me having to follow them around like a helicopter to make sure they are safe. The high top tables at Little Pandas lets me keep an eye on them while still enjoying a tasty drink. They entertain themselves and always find another kiddo to play with.

Now for the more important part of this review; I have read through some of these other reviews and I am shocked at what I have read!

-The owners (husband and wife) both introduced themselves to us when we first checked this spot out and we have had multiple great interactions with them since! They are a huge reason I decided to grab the membership because I truly feel that this is a safe environment for my girls and I.
Even my daughters love looking for them when we arrive.

-the owners should NOT be policing your children! Watch your kids, make sure they are playing nicely and if they are stealing toys from kids or running and being wild, HANDLE THAT YOURSELF! This is not a daycare!

-If anyone going to this place has children, you know how hard it is to keep a play room clean and organized when there are multiple kids running around and dumping toys out. How many of your kids actually put things back where they found it at this age?! I have seen their employees walk the play area cleaning and organizing which I think is great. But then 3 seconds later, I see kids dumping toys back out.

-I am a business owner myself and can appreciate that this couple is trying to provide for their kids and still get work done while their NEWBORN baby sleeps in the stroller right next to them. They don’t need to talk with you or focus all on you. Enjoy their space and let them be business owners/ parents!

-If you hate crowds or going when it’s busy, then don’t go during their peak hours! It’s as simple as that. Same thing with going to the Everett’s children museum! Don’t go to a kid place on a weekend and then be shocked that it is busy. You learn what times are the busiest or most crowded and you avoid it. The building is only so big! Use common sense. They literally offer cheaper play during their slower day and times.

-They even go above and beyond to provide FREE diapers and wipes in their bathrooms because they are also parents and know that sometimes we forget and need those extras! Those small touches in my eyes are amazing.

-this isn’t a restaurant! They offer the usual toddler snacks and some tasty pastries plus fun drinks. Bring your own snacks if this isn’t enough for you. Or hit one of the many restaurants located on the same street.

- People will always find something to complain about or use hurtful statements when they are jealous of something. This family created a  beautiful place that most moms are just wishing to find when they need a minute without having their kids climb all over them and their kids can go burn off energy while interacting nicely with other kids. This is that place 🐼🖤

The drinks and snacks are great and I’ve always experienced great customer service even when the cafe is busy. I love that I can supervise my daughter and do some reading or listen to an audiobook. The owners have been very accommodating and have asked for feedback. Even while trying to care for their own family, they keep the place clean and safe. I appreciate having this place when it’s cold or rainy or even on days where I don’t have the energy to go somewhere like the Children’s Museum or trampoline park. It’s perfect for getting out of the house and not being completely drained after.

Review: We’ve visited Little Pandas Play Cafe a number of times and our kids have absolutely love it! The space is clean, the owners are welcoming, and the staff is super friendly. The delicious drinks are an added bonus!

We also decided to host our little one’s first birthday party at the cafe and it was an amazing time! Azka and Kishaan worked closely with us to make sure every detail was taken care of. Their attention to detail and desire to help ensure things were going smoothly (while planning and during the party) really helped me execute everything as planned. We opted for the “open bar” and our friends were raving about the drinks all evening. All of the kids who attended could not get enough of the play area. I am so glad we chose Little Pandas Play Cafe to host our event. It was a wonderful experience working with the whole team and we would absolutely consider them for future parties.

Review: This place is really cute. I wish I could give it more stars but really would recommend the owners putting a limit on the amount of kids able to play at a time! I also wish there was a younger age limit. My almost 2 year old had a great time but I had to really watch out for the larger kids that were more aggressive. (I guess parents should do a better job of watching their kids play too). Otherwise great spot for toddlers!

Update ok I see on the website the space can hold 33 kids….ummmm no way! Also the age limit is 6.

Review: I can’t say enough good things about this place. From the drinks, to the cleanliness, the amount of fun my three year old has, and the owners. Do yourself a favor and spend the day at little pandas, such a clean and safe environment for kids. I love that they have so much to choose from! The big play structure is my sons favorite he will run around and go down the slide for the longest and when he’s ready to slow down a bit there’s still so much fun to be had with the imaginative play area, such a good balance for littles. I have also noticed the staff going in the play area pretty often to maintain the stations and wipe toys down and that’s something you don’t see too often at kids places! This is our favorite spot in our rotation of places we go.

Review: Poor time management and not the cleanest place to take kids. Have been to this cafe twice and the first time was by myself and was one of the 5 people there and noticed all of the staff were all using their phones while the owners were on there computer/ phone unaware of the two servers taking forever to complete orders because they were both chatting and giggling.
The second time I went was with my two daughters and was surprised how both owners were even less interactive with customers and staff. When I went to play with my girls on the toys noticed how there was either like or food on the slide and the small toys weren't the cleanest. While I played on the slide and play toys with my one daughter noticed the man/ owner staring at my daughter like a creep. Not paying attention to his own baby who they always kept covered up in a stroller. When I started to clean up the toys noticed the same man standing next to his child still in the stroller as he or she was the entire time I went both times. And he was staring at me while I walked around and occasionally leaned over to pick things up. Made me so uncomfortable and aside from them not having many options to chose from on their food menu I would say they had verry poor customer service. The owner was kind of a creep always staring at me or my girls over his glasses mostly when I had my back turned. Honestly not sure why this is considered a cafe and in particular wouldn't recommend bringing your kids here.

Review: My catchphrase is: Google doesn't lie! Most review apps/sites (looking at you, Yelp) are rife with ridiculous reviewers complaining about unrealistic or down right insulting criticisms...

But the parents at this cafe have given mostly stellar reviews and I agree - it's organized, has a clean bathroom very close by, the cafe has tasty chicken empanadas and other goodies, plenty of seating, and a wonderful play area for kids mostly 3 and under. I brought my toddler and he LOVED it here.

It's nice that there's a variety of play: toys, make believe structures, a playground structure, and area for infants.

There's tons of moms and parents that fill up the place. That's something the cafe can't control other than the max occupancy but honestly it's a good sign that it's so popular. It can get crowded and a bit loud, but for a weekday morning the kids can still run around and I thought it was honestly not bad noise level wise.

It's very affordable. I've been to many places that you need to either pay hourly or for an unlimited day pass but it's usually kind of dirty. Here, they have an affordable price (check their site) and we ended up staying for almost 3 hours! Now that's a deal.

When we sat down for lunch, my kid looked out the big windows and kept pointing at the cars/vehicles passing down the road! It was the reason why we ended up buying a 5-Day pass!

The part that made me appreciate this cafe was the customer service. Two ladies at the front were amazing and always so welcoming - they communicated everything about our order from how long it would take to even offering to reheat it (my toddler needed a diaper change). We can't wait to come back!

PS: There's a Goodwill across the parking lot so that's a bonus. More reasons to stop by here.

Review: This place was so much fun! My kids had a blast and the coffee was tasty. However, what really impressed me was the front desk cashier / manager (I’m not sure) helping us find my daughter’s lost toy. She was crying so hard over her lost dinosaur and he personally went into the play area to search for it, and he found it! He didn’t have to do that, and we really appreciated it - most play places just take your number or tell you to come back and check later.  Great place, highly recommend.

A little smaller than expected but enough for little ones to see and do to keep them busy for an hour or so. Id say it’s best for kids 3 and under based on the size and activities. Floor is extremely slippery, even with grip socks. I saw multiple kids slip and almost slipped myself. More padded mats or rugs in the space could help.
A fun rainy day activity for my 3 year old, but not somewhere I’d rush back to.

the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: Place is kind of underwhelming for the way they make it look on the website, customer service wasn’t good at all.     there is an arcade, but  only half the games work, and the claw machines are rigged to let go of the prize on the way up,   And there is only like 6 things to do in the play room, and one of the workers kids were pushing other kids away from half of the stuff.  My kid got bored really quick.   If you’re close with nothing else to do it might  be worth it but definitely not worth more than a  15 to 20 min drive     We drove over an hour and was sorely disappointed.

Review: I love Liggle Land, been coming for two years now! My kid has so much fun and plays for hours and the staff is very kind and friendly. We always get the chicken strips and the yakisoba, delicious. There is a monitor in the sitting area where you can view the play area, and I can sit and work on my computer. We had my daughter's birthday party here last year and she said its her favorite birthday yet. And it doesn't smell weird like most indoor play places. The remodel looks great

Review: I used to take my son here. He had very extreme autism and before it was remodeled he loved it a lot. It was a big slightly liminal play area he could explore. He simply loved it and best thing was he didn’t need a lot of supervision and could just roam and be a kid. Now after the remodel most of the areas he needs heavy supervision and some of the areas he cannot even do because he is not mentally able to do them. The old play area he loved has been condensed and shoved to the side and is much smaller. The place is now extremely chaotic and there are a lot more bigger kids there that would push him around. It’s really too bad. This place used to be a good place to bring your kids with special needs. Kind of like the discovery zone. Now it’s something for older kids activities. Don’t eat the pizza. It is a bit pricey as well and beware using the bathrooms.

Review: I'm very disappointed in the last experience at liggle land on Friday. I've given recommendations before, but this last visit will be our last. My husband took our 5 year old son. This was one of the few places he would get super excited to visit, and request. Having fries in the general allocated food area is also part of the trip. When my husband and son sat at a table, not in the reserved area to eat and enjoy the fries. They were asked to move to another area to accommodate what seemed like a planned group. There are separate rooms that can be reserved, so not sure why either they didn't have signs on the table, or put the group in an reserved area. Why an open area that paying customers were already eating and sitting. Putting signs, closing the facility for a private event makes more sense than moving paying customers. My son felt uncomfortable with the situation and they left early. We will not return.

Review: Liggle Land is an awesome place for kids — tons of fun and perfect for birthday parties! We’ve been here twice, and the kids had an absolute blast both times. The only downside? The pizza… yikes. Probably the worst I’ve ever tasted. The coin games are also a bit too pricey. Honestly, I almost gave it 2 stars just for those reasons, but it’s hard to knock a place where the kids are grinning from ear to ear. If they ever fix the food and maybe adjust the game prices, it’d be a total win. Not sure I’d book another party here, but never say never.

All but two of the VR games were broken. Which was all the more annoying because the person manning the counter let us buy tokens knowing almost none of the games worked. Place was pretty dirty too. Recommend skipping and visiting Next Level Pinball in Hillsboro.

Review: We have been going to Liggle Land for years and have spent many hours here. We visited today and I have to say the quality has gone down immensely especially since the interior was remodeled. The place was so packed today you could barely move. The bathrooms were so filthy and hadn't been maintained what seemed like all day with pee all over the toilets and in front of them with soaked toilet paper. Maybe they need to consider a reservation system as it seemed like a fire hazard with how many people were packed into that place. My daughter and her friend insisted on leaving within an hour of being there.

We paid $20 and when we got to the play area a worker informed us that they’d be closing at 4:30 for 30 minutes to sanitize. I understand the need but I definitely was disappointed that it wasn’t disclosed to us before we paid.

I was also surprised there weren’t benches for kids to sit down for putting on/taking off shoes. The area outside of the play structure was so small and crowded, wasn’t very friendly for parents to be supervising. I’ve been to much better indoor playgrounds

Review: The place is very entertaining for my children, I join the opinions that this place has a lot of potential but is definitely neglected. Today I have been in this place and I have been disappointed. Many ADULTS without socks and others with shoes, in the play area... it really bothers me that they do not obey the rules, since those who are playing are even their own children, they put their hands everywhere... imagine a barefoot person (in my opinion that is disgusting) I do not know if your feet are clean, without fungus, etc... Little staff to attend such a big place, they simply do not comply with the safety and hygiene standards... They close for 30 minutes at certain times, supposedly to clean... and I really wonder... Cleaning of what? Where?? because when you enter at the end it is ""cleaning"" and everything remains the same...

Review: The floors here are so gross. Everywhere you look is hair, dirt, FINGER NAILS, leaves, etc. they must sweep like once a month? The place was nearly empty, just us and 3 other families yet nobody was cleaning anything. Most of the machines don’t work either. Just a bad experience and crazy that previous reviews have talked about how dirty it is and nothing has been done to fix it. Not a good place for young kids to play.

Wanted to add, when we were leaving, a female employee tried to get us to stay by giving us a free claw machine game. She was very nice and you can tell she cared but ultimately it is just way too dirty.

Review: My child had a blast! From a parent’s perspective, it felt a bit chaotic and loud. Our time session was from 5-8pm. Sitting around the play structures is very limited, which made it hard to constantly keep eyes on the kiddos. Personally, we didn’t buy any food or drinks. I do suggest to eat beforehand or bring some snacks since it’s bit overpriced. Overall I do appreciate that they clean in between sessions, but I wish they had a limit on capacity. It felt very overcrowded around the play structures.

Huge facility.  I’m thankful a place like this open BUT Needs a lot of cleaning and things need fixing.  Fair pricing.  I agree with others that the owner/manager is neglecting this business.
Kids having great time.  Other side is Bar and food and Virtual Reality Arcade.

They have American and Korean food.  I ordered the Buffalo flavored Wings,  the wings should have been cooked a few minutes longer for more Crisp and crunch.  They put my buffalo sauce on the side, in which I had never told them to do so.  That was inconvenient for me as I had to dip the wings in the sauce.
If they can’t get wings right, then how is the other food?

Don't forget the bar, so you can have a parent drink while the kids play.  Wifi for parents to work while the kids play too, even in the outdoor patio.

Review: The place was nice, quite entertaining, and my daughters really enjoyed it. But from a parent's perspective, I'm quite disappointed with the cleanliness. The first level of the playground is clean, but the lower levels are disgusting. There's a lot of dust, and it's obvious they haven't cleaned the tarps in several months. My girls' clothes came out just as dirty as they do when you go to a park. As other parents mention, the place has good potential, but perhaps the staff needs to be better trained since the person who greets you is only on their cell phone and there's no one keeping an eye on what's happening in the playground. Although parents are responsible for their children, the company's reputation is also at stake. We will definitely return, but I hope the cleanliness issue is resolved.

Review: This place was a huge disappointment. I took my five-year-old twins and about 20 minutes into their play my son got his head stuck in an area where the air blow ball gun area was. That is not visible to the parents but my daughter came running down hysterically crying and screaming that my son had his head stuck and I went to the staff and said how do I get up there?! they just kinda looked at me without telling me and I said can I try to get up there his head is stuck and again the untrained Teenage staff didn’t know what to say or do so I went up and squeezed my way through the small ladder and I’m at smaller frame barely was able to get thru and my sons head was difficult to get out And very traumatizing for us all. we were all crying and when we all came down to get something to drink and calm down not one staff member asked how my son was or what happened or anything. They didn’t seem to care and many didn’t speak good English. I was also not informed of what all was included since it was our first time and the walkabout obstacle area said closed on it then I saw some kids on it and my daughter wanted to do it so she did it and had fun but then by the time she was done my son wanted to do it but the guy was nowhere to be found. we were only about an hour and a half into the 3 hours of playtime and  they said it was closed. My son was heartbroken. I asked them what time they closed and they never gave me a straight answer except the guy said he’s not tall enough anyway and actually he was 3 inches under the height requirement but my son and daughter are twins and the same height maybe half an inch apart at most so why did you let my daughter in but not my son? lastly the whole place was dirty and not sanitary at all and there was no good seating area for adults to see their kids play. So loud and chaotic compared to other places with even more kids. I Witnessed 2 adults arguing loudly about balls being thrown and getting hit but it’s specifically the game that is set up for them to hit the wall with them and they are the lightest balls ever- so be playful and occasionally take a soft touch of a ball or move away from the ball pit. Set an example for your kids to see how you can rationally handle a situation with a stranger not angry aggression in a ball pit! not much to be said for the staff that was nearby witnessing even after the woman demanded to be heard that she was being hit by the soft balls repeatedly. The food was also terrible - we had the pizza and it was barely touched by my hungry kids and I had a bite of it-it was really gross. my son also got hurt by another kid jumping on him in the ball pit huge ball pit and my son was the only one in it. No parents around to direct the 2-3 year old in their rough play. although my kids mostly had fun I will not be taking them again- it does not meet safety standards at all in my opinion.

Review: I live 40 min away and decided to go check it out with my brother and our kids. I was unfortunately very disappointed. When I first walked in I noticed a smell, that didn’t go away ( It smelled musty). Next, the food was not it. I ordered tater tot and mozzarella sticks. The tots were bland, and needed a little seasoning and the mozzarella sticks were served with sweet chili sauce. I was shocked and it was an awful combo. The sodas were flat and tasted weird. I thought maybe it was just the coke but the spirit was the same. Moving into the kids play area, things were ripped and seems like they were falling apart a bit. What was also unfortunate is that there is no where for parents to sit and watch the kids. The set up was a bit weird. Also, floors were very dirty. Even inside the play area where they require no shoes. They also say you have to wear socks but k saw parents and kids barefoot in there. So they don’t seem to uphold rules very well. Lastly, the bathrooms they were disgusting to say the least.

I wouldn’t and won’t be coming back.

I understand it’s a parents job to supervise their own children however they don’t so staff need to be more aware. The establishment was dirty, restrooms had pee on the toilet seats.
Also if your paying full price to play all area should be opened, tell me why the area with the climibing rope course structure area was closed? Which kind left very little for bigger kids to do. Not going back!!!! I will say the one star I left is for the restaurant staff they were great!!!

Like other reviewers stated, it’s quite frankly falling apart, many areas were held together by duct tape or zip ties. Balls from the pit everywhere. Big kids in the toddler area. There was nowhere for parents to sit and be able to see their kids. Management was mainly non-existent or pre-occupied by their iPad - booking trips on TripAdvisor.

Hopefully this review saves someone from wasting $20 (for one kid/adult!) like we did.

Review: This place is filthy. We are spending our spring break going to local arcades and play places. So far, this is the worst. We came just for the VR arcade. On the south entry (where the arcade is) there are no signs, no staff and no direction. Nothing that says “Hey! Buy tokens for VR over here!” We finally spotted an employee who immediately directed us down the hall to check in without asking what we needed. Well, the people down the hall said, no go back to the VR area. SMH.

Tips for this employee and establishment:
1) Greet everyone who enters
2) Ask if they have been in before and if you can help them
3) Assist appropriately
4) If you don’t have staff for this, make a giant sign that indicates how things work.

After buying our tokens & dealing with more incompetence that I wont go into, our kids played on 4 of the 6 working VR games in the 12 game arcade. Ridiculous. Instructions are out of date (they use coins now and there are no seat belts) and terribly written. Every single game was filthy. It looks as though it’s never been dusted or sanitized. Cost will run you $1 a coin, 4-7 coins per game. Each game is 1-4 minutes on average. However I would never recommend coming here. But you were warned.

Their cleaning could be better. They also barely have any seating near the play area. There’s also lots of exits all around which can be unsafe. You can’t see the back of the playing areas up top & some adults were sitting up at the top on their phones which is very concerning..

Review: I'm trying not to hurt their rating too much but this place has sooooo many problems! I was fooled by the play sessions setting, thought they were going to clean things up every couple of hours. No no no.  People work there were either playing games or watching games. No one cares about cleaning.  You can see black dirt balls and food crumbles on the discolored mat.  These dirts are not something can be built up in a couple of days. It must takes weeks or months!
Balls from the ball pit are everywhere.
The mat is uneven and many kids tripped over it(first thing happened to my daughter).
The main play area is pretty worn-out. Screws are detached, net is broken. Many safety issues. The spoong block pit is disgusting, has so much dirt and hair.
The final straw of the day was seeing a parent walking barefoot in the toddler area and no one care to enforce the socks requirement.

Review: It definitely has some unique and interesting play structures. However it is not well cleaned. A kid peed going down the slide. The parent told the teen working the desk about but I decided to take my kid home and had toer the manager know on my way out. I felt gross and not worth the $12.

Review: We had a birthday party here today. We arrive in advance to set up and the room we requested 2 months ago but it was issued to different people's party. The biggest issue we had was an elderly woman was in the children play area with a child and yelling at that kid and other children. Saying horrible things to small children. The children were upset and several of our friends children's came to the room fearful of this woman who was still in the play area of the facility. I spoke with the manager and she said she would not ask the person to leave even though the woman was being completely inappropriate around children. We will not be recommending.

As below the owerner has no ownership over the situation. I paid a deposit for the jungle room. I have a 5 year old an we are very anti gun so clearly a room near fire arms was never an option (they also don't put the room on the recipes or didn't on mine) .

Also the inappropriate woman got into an argument with a different latina woman. Not all latinas are the same. When I felt that my children were unsafe I did go closer to them on the play area to make sure they were safe. Yes. I will call the cops if an adult threatens my child or verbally assaults them. Luckily this didn't happen. Completely offensive that the owner again not only made a  blind accusations and then lying. Shame on you.

Review: They have an amazing indoor area for kids, which is great for when it is raining. I have 3 children 4,6,9. We have been 15 plus times and have never needed to worry about them getting hurt or wandering off. My children get lots of exercise and are exhausted when we leave.

The staff, especially Jason and his family, are incredibly friendly and helpful. The food is very good. My kids always get pizza, but I would also recommend the noodles and other items. Overall this is a great place to take the family for an afternoon of fun.

I was constantly trying to find my grandchild  in the maze of tunnels and netting. The one in called dizzy castle in Vancouver has a metal lock on the gate so they can’t leave and it’s cheaper!

Review: Gosh we use to love this place. The last two times have just killed it. Last time the staff member was in the playground rolling around with the kids and acting as their care giver. I was clearly watching her every move. It felt super inappropriate. She was all up in my kids and someone else’s kids face and it felt ick. We left after that went on for about 30 minutes. The second bad experience was a lady came in hacking up a lung and her poor kid had the worst flemy cough you can imagine. Couldn’t hardly breathe between coughs.  Not covering her mouth at all ( she was like 4 so that’s to be expected) her nose is was running all down her face. I approached the staff and asked if they typically allow super sick individuals to come in to play? She just shrugged her shoulders and said “yep” and here we are a week later and my entire household is sick. Sadly we won’t be going back there. This place needs to get their staffing and rules figured out. It’s a mess.

Review: Hosted our 4 year olds birthday party here and would 10/10 recommend. We had around 15 kids ages 6 months-8years old and about 20 adults. Everyone fit wonderfully and the kids had a blast, we rented the entire place out and the price was very reasonable (around $350 for 2 hours plus pizza). Our party host on Sunday 5/7 was awesome to work with and dealt with the kids amazingly, she was stern but friendly with their rules to the kiddos preventing me from having to yell at anyone and was helpful and friendly to all of the adults. My only gripe was I wish our rental could have been a  bit longer without having to book an entire extra 2 hours for double the price. I loved getting to decorate and make it special for my daughter without having to deal with a ton of cleanup prep and post party mess. Thank you!

Review: Such an awful experience solely due to the staff member (bigger lady with dark complexion), which is really unfortunate. We’ve always enjoyed taking our kids here, even have had a birthday party previously. But this time was just so terrible that we will never return or support this business.
I booked a party several weeks prior to our event, including paying a deposit, with this particular staff member. She explained the details of what was included…though NEVER informed us about additional fees for extra kids, not even how many kids they allowed before they would start charging, didn’t say the cost of each additional pizza, and didn’t say the kids weren’t allowed to play during pizza time.
The day before the event, I called to order extra pizza…to learn the woman never actually scheduled my event, despite the deposit I had made. Luckily they were still able to schedule it, but they never took accountability for THEIR mistake and just said “sorry about the confusion” (Ummmm there’s no confusion, YOUR staff member didn’t schedule our party).
During the event, the same woman was so rude to our attendees including the kids. She then ended up charging us about $100 OVER than what she initially quoted. When my husband expressed his disappointment, the woman LAUGHED at him and said “sorry you feel that way”.
This woman should find another job that isn’t in the customer service field or anything that has to do with children. So because of her, we will never return to this business. As other reviewers have stated, book your party elsewhere.

Review: I've been coming here since my baby was maybe 6 months. It's been so fun to see her return each time and pay attention to new things as she gets older. Love that there is a separate baby area and crawler area. I love that I can but here since everything is safe and well-designed for babies and toddlers. I can stop redirecting all the time and just enjoy my kid. It is too pricy for us to come as often as I'd like, but it's still worth it.

Easy entrance pay and also let customers know more clearly that they need to pay before coming. Otherwise fun stuff for the kids!

Review: This place was really clean and well maintained for not having a staff on site. A day pass is a bit pricy especially if you are just there for a little bit, but if you lived nearby it seems like a great place to let your toddler burn energy with a monthly pass. Parking can be hard depending on the time / day of the week since the lot is small and there are many businesses in the same building.

Review: Came in today w my 1 yr old & 3 y/o twins for something to do in the -temps. We had a blast. My baby learned how to climb & go down slides & my toddlers found a new love for swinging/spinning (egg swing is what we called it).

If you're looking for a safe space for your kiddos to play where parents are tentative to their children, this is it. We didn't have to worry about any unsupervised kids. Door is heavy enough to where if a kiddo did run off, they wouldn't be able to exit. & the place isn't big to where you feel overwhelmed. You can see your child from any location in the room.

The place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well, no odors or messes. Bonus points for the rubber flooring that makes falls easier to handle. & the couches placed throughout so parents have somewhere to sit. Offially our favorite local indoor place for the littles. Safe. Fun. Friendly.

Review: This is the best indoor baby/toddler play place in the north metro by far. I'd recommend this for ages 3 and under. It's designed for parents who also have an infant to care for, as there a whole corner just for tinies that includes a rocking/nursing chair!! There's a little area for crawlers so that they don't get trampled. There are FOUR big, comfy couches around for the adults, flooring is totally padded except for the kitchen area. THEY STOCK THE BATHROOMS WITH DIAPERS AND WIPES. That's unheard of. Decent vending machine, sink, coffee machine, drinking fountains, cubbies for shoes and coats. $14 for one kid, good for the whole day.

Very nice place for my 18-month-old baby, clean and nice, although very cold, it is important to be in socks to keep clean, but my feet froze. From that I brought extra clothes and wrap my little one. It would definitely be more comfortable at a temperature more suited to the climate.
Otherwise I really liked it.

All of the play structures seem very clean and sturdy. There are many different types of toys that will keep toddlers/young kids engaged for a while. Nice couches & seating for adults. Bathrooms are clean and have an assortment of supplies and changing tables (in both mens and womens restrooms). The facility seems secure with the keypad entry. We will be going again!

Also, he wears special orthotic braces that need to go with shoes- I sent a message on the website about them and got a prompt response. They were happy to allow him to keep his shoes on (I cleaned them well!) I really appreciated that accommodation! My little guy had so much fun playing here. We'll certainly be back :)

Review: Fun place for little ones. Both 2.5yr olds were able to keep themselves entertained for 2+ hours playing, exploring, climbing, and making friends. Nice atmosphere for moms also; you can choose to socialize or to do your own thing. You are able to bring in food or buy their snacks and drinks which can be convenient. There were only two tables so when both were occupied with other parents working/reading, or storing their food and stuff, we unfortunately resorted to sitting on the floor to eat until a table opened up. Overall, this is a quality place I would return to in the future for my little ones.

Review: It was okay. Fun idea but I think more thought should have gone into it. Very haphazard.  Way too expensive.  Lights were off and we couldn’t figure out where the switch was.  Lots of dangerous things such as the back door could very easily be opened, no bumpers on doors for finger protection, the metal grates in the doors are sharp and fingers could get stuck in them. We found toys with small pieces that young ones could choke on. The thing that I noticed was how toxic everything is. The chemical smell from the plastic is obviously not safe for children to be exposed to.
I probably wouldn’t pay to come back.

There were about 10 families in the playground at the same time. We all had a lot of room to spread out and more than enough toys to play with. The honeycomb slide is a personal favorite for our son. He had a ton of fun climbing through each area up and down.

Review: My son absolutely loves Ahoy Kitsap Playland, and it's become one of our favorite go-to spots in Kitsap! We visit often, and every time, he has a blast — especially with the slides. The whole place is incredibly kid-friendly and safe, which gives me peace of mind as a parent.
The atmosphere is bright, clean, and welcoming. It's clear the staff cares about maintaining a fun and safe environment. One of the best things is that parents can actually sit back and relax while the kids play. There’s plenty of comfortable seating, good visibility of the play areas, and free Wi-Fi — a rare and much-appreciated combination for any indoor play space.
Ahoy Kitsap Playland strikes a great balance between active fun for kids and a laid-back vibe for parents. I highly recommend it to any families looking for a safe, fun, and clean place to let their little ones burn off some energy!

Review: My kids and I genuinely love this place. My kids play non-stop and it gives me an opportunity to sit back, relax, and watch them safely play from a nearby table. There is an area for smaller children that has open ended toy play, as well as the main playground. It’s clean and the staff are very friendly. The only downside is that you can’t bring in your own food/snacks. My kids have fallen in love with the snack bar, which is extensive. They also have hot and cold food options, a coffee menu, milk shakes, ice cream, drinks for kids and adults, etc. I have nothing had to say about this place. We come back and back, over and over again, especially on not so nice days. We drive over from Gig Harbor.

Review: I would have given a better rating if they were more accommodating to kids with severe food allergies. My son cannot eat a single snack option they sell inside but they refuse to allow ANY outside snacks even for babies/toddlers who they do not offer safe food options for. This is severely disappointing considering they sell a TON of food and drinks inside so it’s not about not allowing any food or drinks you just cannot bring your own even with anaphylactic allergies even though they don’t sell fully allergy safe snacks. Seems like discrimination to me.

Not sure if I will be back considering this limitation. For the price of $16 a kid you want to stay more than an hour to get your money worth but can’t bring safe snacks for your kids.

Review: Place is clean and nice. Smaller children's playground is easily good for children 8mo+. The larger playground for children 3yr+ is great as well. Kids easily run around for 2-3hrs.

Snacks are decent, mostly sugar treats and not terribly prices. They now ""serve"" alcohol buts it's not worth buying. It's easily not only marked up 5-7x the price (so $7 for a rainer beer) but it's also their ""policy"" that you have to buy a snack with any alcohol purchase so now it's even more expensive. What a joke lmaoo. If they lowered their beer to $5 and no stupid snack they'd actually sell some.

Review: Hard to find b/c the sign is fairly small on the highway; turn in to the United Rentals road and then go up the hill. Lots of parking. The indoor play area is huge (think of several McDonald’s indoor gyms put together). They have two small birthday rooms with tables and chairs and a sink (up a staircase) but not accessible as far as I could tell. I’m not sure if there is an elevator to get up there or not so folks should ask about that if needed. The kids had a wonderful time though…the family brought food and gifts and the kids played for hours!

Review: Fun place. A lot of climbing, jumping, sliding and places to hide BUT kids always ended up with severe lower GI issues. I ended up with Covid over Christmas after seeing Santa. Do not think it's food related as most items are prepackaged. Other grandmas have agreed about illnesses after visiting when we are arranging play dates.  Need better and more effective cleaning practices I'm guessing.

Review: This place is a nice alternative to the park when it’s rainy/cold, but there’s really not a whole lot for little ones and the area dedicated to them doesn’t have a very secure door, toddlers can just push it open and escape into the bigger area. They also changed the rules so you can’t bring in your own food, which I kind of understand for allergy reasons. The virtual reality area is pretty cool but I’m not sure if the price overall is really worth it to go all the time. I spent a good amount of time trying to keep my busy toddler inside the toddler area and then chasing him around to make sure he doesn’t get hurt by the bigger kids, so we both got some cardio in at least!

Review: I DO NOT recommend booking your birthday party here.

Room was small, hot (even with a portable ac that hardly worked), and smelled like wet dog and chemicals. Decorations wouldn’t stick to the walls and kept falling down. They gave us a mop to hold up the piñata by hand on the end of the stick handle. Play area looked packed beyond capacity. Standing room only, parents looked miserable. We were rushed in and out. Bathroom was filthy. Owner was rude and condescending. Spent over $400

Review: Fun and safe place to take the little ones. Is a well-disguised and entertaining prison, (one child-accessible exit) which means that us parents can mostly relax despite not being able to see them at ALL times in the large play area.
Went to a birthday party here which was reasonably priced with a private room.
Would go here again.
They get 4 stars here when it really should be five because they require you to purchase a food item with an adult beverage even after spending at least a few hundred dollars on a party that includes food purchased from the venue.

As an African American women I felt as though they was racist and made feel like my family and I was not welcomed. The bathrooms stink and it is sticky. If you have to leave your shoes in the front why the floors so sticky? The slides and tower is dirty, There is kids sliding down with the cars and the workers do nothing about it. I even complained about older kids trampling me and my child over!!!! They do nothing!!!! The food is nasty. I even saw a worker she had purple hair  dig in her nose and continued to make food. This is the worst establishment. Kitsap ahoy you will never get my money again $!!!!!!!!

The kids act like wild animals (shoving each other, playing on equipment incorrectly, screaming constantly), parents sit at tables on their phones and ignore their own responsibilities, and the staff makes no attempt at enforcing rules. One of our kids was pushed down a slide, we reported it (as the sign posted says to do) and the lady just walked over and told my husband that the kid wasn’t doing anything that very moment so they did nothing, then why is there a sign to report it? I don’t understand why there a multiple signs posted with rules but yet not one is enforced.

Review: Avoid this place and if you do go DO NOT buy a membership or use a card, only use cash. It’s small and extremely overpriced. Membership is expensive and if you decide you don’t want it anymore they require a months notice and if you are even 24 hours past what they consider the month mark they will refuse your request to cancel and charge your card anyway. Even if you’ve moved and will no longer be using their establishment, which I did make clear to them. They will charge your card without your permission even after removing your card from their system they keep it and use it anyways. It’s absolutely disgusting how administration treats people. They also do not enforce rules and safety. Older kids often trample through the toddler area and at times hurt smaller children. They also run up the slides causing crashes and safety issues. One of the times we were there a child fell through a broken area in the upper level and my husband and I had to climb the big slide and push her up to get her to safety as she was just hanging half way through stuck and her mom couldn’t reach her. And lastly they do allow sick children in which creates an unsafe medical environment as well. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: My 1.5 year old and I came for the first time today and we had a blast. We got there just after 9am and it was already pretty busy but there was more than enough room for my guy to run around and play. We will definitely be coming back and so happy that Bonkerz is serving Wenatchee Valley!

Review: My son absolutely loves Bonkerz!
I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: Love how this business supports the community of Kalispell and is a safe place for children from all backgrounds to have fun. I used their drop in service for my 2 children and they both had fun, were most importantly kept safe, and both look forward to coming to play again in the future. The manager responded immediately to my texts and even sent me a picture update, which I truly appreciated! Thank you!

My boys have the best time there they go to the after school program there and any school breaks and soon Summer break! I highly recommend them! When your kids don’t want to leave because they are having too much fun that is a great sign! Plus they have parents night out sometimes and nerf nights for kids! Fun night activities again for ALL ages! The valley is SO Lucky to have them!! Thank you for all you do for us!

The owner had 15 kids, they are were very well behaved, listened and were a pleasant to have on the mats! That in its self speaks highly of how they conduct business. I was very impressed on handling that many kids in a public place! I would recommend them, great job Clarke’s Cubs.

Review: My son was so excited to attend 'Nerf Night' at Clarke's Cubs for the first time. Everything seemed fine until the end when things took a bad turn. The adults weren’t paying attention, and a group of boys ganged up on him, shooting him at close range to hurt him. They even ran into him, leaving a bruise, and he came home with welts from the Nerf guns. Worst of all, none of the adults noticed he was crying or upset. It’s heartbreaking because he was so eager to join this activity, but he ended up in pain and tears instead.

Review: *** TRIGGER WARNING SA ASSAULT HAPPENED HERE***
They somehow deleted lots of complaints from google..

December 2024 Assault happened here!!

I don't usually repost things but as a parent, I can't not warn / notify other parents
We had our daughter's birthday here after this horrific incident and had no idea until this vague post by Jungle Playland posted today...we would not have rescheduled her party here or supported this business another day after this incident or how they horribly and unprofessionally handled the whole situation.. we are sick about this..
Just a heads up in case others parents here have taken their children here or plan to..
Heartbroken and prayers for the affected children and families💔

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: Bummed to give this a 3 star. While the play space itself is so wonderful, clean and loads of fun…. The environment is NOT! The “concession area” is not locked, separate or out of reach of littles. Thus toddlers are constantly taking items because why not? However then the employees are forced to tell the parent because they “touched” it you must buy it. 1-3yr olds do NOT understand this concept and are a major amount of the kids I see there on weekdays when everyone else is in school. I’ve given feedback several times and emailed then owner. The responses seem genuine yet nothing has been done.

The young lady on staff said they were closed already I asked if there was notice given and she said “unfortunately no today” my kids were sobbing crying since they wanted to play. Being that the weather outside is not very nice right now.

As a mom, being turned away with my kids is so frustrating.
It would be very appreciated if you update the hours on the days you decide to close early that way you don’t ruin someone’s day..

We appreciate it when they do that!

Review: I recently visited Ocean Play on Monday afternoon and found that it might not be the best fit for younger children. The facilities seem more geared towards older kids, with activities and equipment that may be too advanced for toddlers or very young children.

While the space is very small it is well-maintained and has some fun features, the experience didn’t quite justify the price. Weekday price ($11 for 1-3 yr & $13 for 4-12 yr Socks not included extra cost) Given the cost, I expected more in terms of variety and engagement for younger age groups.

Review: We have been playing at Ocean Play for more than half a year now. This is my kids' favorite indoor playground in the Hillsboro area.

Location:
Ocean Play is conveniently located in a plaza, making it easy to go shopping after playtime. It also has plenty of parking space, so I never worry about finding a spot.

Service:
The service at Ocean Play is excellent. The place is always clean, and I feel very safe when my kids are running around. They also offer some snacks to eat and free Wi-Fi service. The restrooms are very clean as well. If they have a party event, they always post the latest schedule on Google beforehand.

Cost:
It is cheaper to play during weekdays. However, the best money-saving tip is to buy their punch card (if you live close by and your kids like the place).

The playground has lots of attractions that my kids enjoy. As the saying goes, ""a picture is worth a thousand words.""

Review: This is a fun spot for a 2 year old. My boy loves running and playing here.

Definitely supervise your child, some parents don't as much, and it can get a little wild. It's not super busy during the week. There's plenty of seating for the adults. You can mostly see into the play structure, but there is some blindspots. It's a very casual atmosphere.

Overall cleanliness could be a little better. The bathroom door often gets left open, some murals peeling off the walls, and some play structure pieces havent been replaced yet since we've been a few times.

But we still love it and will be back!

Review: Their website is not up to date!  Just showed up at the venue and they are now saying there is a private party.  I literally looked yesterday online to confirm the open time and see if there were any private parties.  They re updating the website as I type.  Saw another family get denied too. Poor kids!

A month ago I learned that they have a special section on the website to double check if there is a private party since we showed up and were denied.  So it’s really a shame to check yesterday to make sure there aren’t any private parties and then show up to see that there is a private party.

Done with this place until they figure how to run a business.

Review: By far the cleanest indoor play structure in the Portland metro area. The kids loved it and it was easy to keep an eye on them. Parking is easy. It would be great if there was more seating but I'm not sure how they could fit that.

I took off one star because the food situation was a little misleading, we didn't realize that the food menu was for a different restaurant that would deliver the food so there would be a long wait plus high minimum order size. No biggie though, we'll just bring our own lunch next time but we left with some pretty hangry kids today.

Review: I love this place, been coming since they opened. I miss the old punch card but other than that it's a great place for the kids to blow off some steam and make friends. It would be nice to have a punch card again that made sense $ wise. The newer/current pricing only saves you a couple dollars and we have been coming here less because of it... it's a little spendy for the hour or less we usually stay there. Overall tho, still a cute place to bring your kids to play, 10/10 recommend!

Review: Update: I really like this place but it is quite frustrating that they charge the same amount for babies and young toddlers. My little one is just starting to walk and loves the place but can only last an hour or so and cannot use the whole place like older children can but they still charge the same amount. I wish they had a reduced price for the little ones. Also my first experience here was great. The worker was so kind. But since then it has been different people and they have been very short and unwelcoming.

Ocean Plays is a lovely little indoor park for young children. It was my first time there today and my infant loved it! It’s a small space but there are tons to do. The staff there today was wonderful (Bri) and she showed us the playground, gave us a lot of information, answered all our questions, and was extremely kind and welcoming. All around great experience!

Review: My 6 year old son was invited for a birthday party 3/25/23 and the place was PACKED. Children running into each other and getting hurt left and right. My son ended up landing on some of the hard play equipment and heavily bruised his chest to the point we almost went urgent care as the pain was that intense. 20 minutes after taking a break he still couldn’t apply any pressure to either arm as he would cry in pain. So we left. We were there only an hour. There were only two employees at the front desk chatting it up with each other not watching the door as kids were just walking in and out- great safety measures! I left with my son and they didn’t even notice so don’t leave your children there for a birthday party (so glad I didn’t) as the staff won’t watch your kids to make sure the right child is leaving with the right adult.They ask you to sign in but I don’t see why.  No supervision on the floor as there were only two employees for about 70 plus people in this very small space and the front area was so full of shoes you could barely walk without tripping because it was obvious they were over capacity even for fire code. Great concept- awful staffing and not safe for your children. We won’t ever be going back.

When there isn't a party, they let me take work calls from their party room where it's quieter if needed.

Pros:
Safe & friendly atmosphere.
The place is cleaned prior to the party.
They provide utensils/plates/cups/napkins

You can bring any food (just no crockpots).
They do clean-up afterwards.

Review: I can't let another day go by without thanking you. sincerely for your prompt and attentive service while my Baby-Girl playing.
Service like yours is rare in business these days, and I do not want my appreciation to go unstated.
I can honestly say that’s the best place to take your child to have a blast while you rest and enjoy a cup of coffee.
You can be certain that I will continue to drive from Sherwood to your place.

Review: We had an amazing experience here. 7th birthday party was perfect. I arrived early to decorate and they were absolutely accommodating. The staff were friendly and helpful. Many times after I said a need out loud to my cohost, the item appeared with a smile. The play structure is a goodt size and the varying items for play were great for our 7 year olds and our 3 year olds. Since we were the only people there, even my 13 year old got in on the fun but he says his back hurts from hunching over 🤣

The price is great for everything you get and the customer service was STELLAR! They really wanted to make sure it was going smoothly and that all the party guests were having a great time.

My toddler keeps asking if we can go back. We definitely will.

Disclaimer: we were there yesterday, on the first really nice day this season, so we were spoiled with being the only people for the entire 2 hour time block. I can imagine this place is busy on rainy days

Review: We did a private rental of Ocean Plays for our child’s birthday party over the weekend. Don’t be fooled by the humble exterior: the facility is fantastic, but first I need to rave about the staff. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time to find the facility closed and two staff members, Rayna and another wonderful lady (sorry I missed your name!) cleaning, sanitizing, and tidying up the entire place. When we went in, they were beyond helpful—asking what they could do and making suggestions as to how we could most efficiently use the space. They offered to carry in supplies from our car, set up the decor and party signs, brought tape and scissors for things we needed, everything. They never once were bossy or restrictive, and instead were the most gracious and helpful people. They even popped on masks without being asked as they noticed our party was wearing them. Nothing was too big of an ask for them, and they coordinated things I hadn’t even thought of, such as when to do cake, rounding up the children for dinner, cleaning up spills, offering bootie covers for parents who didn’t wish to remove their shoes, everything. I just can’t get over how extremely helpful they were. The facility was perfect for our party of approximately fifty people with still more room to spare. The kids in attendance ranged from 1.5 to 10 years old and everyone had an awesome time. There were slides, a ball pit, climbing things, and shooting cannons (which were not loud or startling at all for our group, which included some sensitive kids). Everything looked new—no rips or duct taped patches, crushed balls, or dirty floors. For the adults there were lovely couches with electrical socket plugs and massage chairs. They also offer snacks and drinks for a reasonable fee, and there are two individual restrooms. There is a huge emphasis on cleanliness and hand sanitizer was placed everywhere. The main area alongside the play area had the couches and tables that held everyone comfortably, and there was also a smaller side room that had two tables and a long table running the length of the wall, perfect for our pizza bar. We brought in outside food—huge plus to be able to do that, though they do offer delivery of pizza schmizza. At the end of the party we did no cleanup—it was so stress-free. For all of this service and private rental of the full space, where you don’t have to worry about strangers or kids wandering off, the price was beyond reasonable. I highly recommend a party at Ocean Plays.

Review: This place is cute and my toddler likes it. I wish weekends had better hours. Especially since they stop letting people come inside eventually. My toddler's heart was broken today. We went to play at 2 and despite people leaving we were told it was at capacity and couldn't come play. Maybe reservations or being able to mark closed or something on Google or something once people can't come anymore would be helpful. We left with her screaming and crying that she couldn't play and we drove 35 minutes just for this. Very sad to see her so upset. Had to go to another play place and may just stick to another one we know when we can come to play for sure.

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: This place was recommended to us by a friend. I have a 3 year old. We went on a Tuesday morning. Great concept, poor execution. It was entirely too crowded, to the point where it felt unsafe. I’m not sure what their capacity is but it sure seemed to exceed what was safe. Way too many kids and at least half of the parents and caregivers were having social hour or had their faces buried in their phones. So many unsupervised kids, many of them bigger kids who were running and jumping all over the place with no regard for the littles. I lost count of the number of times I saw a toddler almost get hurt by a big kid. And you have to sign a waiver saying if your kid gets hurt it’s not the responsibility of the business. If you’re looking for something similar, stick to Play Street Museum. We won’t be back here.

Review: **update**

The owner called me and apologized for what happened and said she will be talking with this employee and wants us to come back in to have a better experience. She was super nice and genuinely sorry. We will be going back to give them another shot.

Today was our 2nd time going and I was so disappointed. It was so busy which made it a bit overwhelming. The lady that was working today had her 2 daughters there. They were running around all over the place like banshees and climbing on top of all of the furniture (standing on top of the bakery area, climbing the playset in the middle like a rock wall, etc). There were a few times where they almost ran into my son while they were running around crazy. The whole time this was happening, their mom was sitting up front on her phone. I don't care if you have your children there while you're working. But if all parents are required to supervise their children, then employees should be required too. Or don't bring your kids to work if they don't know how to behave in public. And on top of all of that, they were playing songs with swear words. How is that appropriate for a children's play place? My 1st time here, I loved it. Which is why I came back for a 2nd time. But after today, I'm not sure if I will come back. Not trying to deal with my son listening to inappropriate music while having to make sure he doesn't get hurt by older kids acting crazy.

We have been to many different indoor playgrounds, children’s museums, etc. and this is my favorite place so far. The atmosphere is very relaxed, much less chaotic than other places we’ve been. I love that you can basically see the whole play area at once. My three year old had a blast, plus the baby area was perfect for my little one. The little seating area was perfect for lunch. We will definitely be back and I would highly recommend to anyone with young kids!

Review: We have been here twice and have been really impressed both times. I loved that adults don’t have to pay for admission here. That’s a barrier for checking out similar places for us. Although some reviews took away a star for the reservation needs, I would say this is a positive thing. We have a membership to the children’s museum downtown and it always feels so chaotic. This space is designed with littles in mind and the cap makes it feel less overwhelming.
It was great to see the staff sanitizing toys while the kids were playing and they kept things organized. We loved the range of things to do, including the glow in the dark room, the sand area, the water room, and the ball pit.
My only critique for this business would be to remove the dinosaur bones from the sand pit. My toddler really wanted to dig in the sand but kept slipping on the dinosaur and falling. It didn’t feel as aligned with the age demographic as well as the other play areas.
Overall would definitely recommend!

The music is low, you can hear over it which is a huge plus! The baby area was a lot of fun for my youngest who loves the car and stacking toys. It's gated but the gate is low enough to still feel a part of the bigger room while safely tucked to the side. My oldest enjoyed the large play room and the ball pit. It was busy but it didn't feel overcrowded at all! Everyone was so polite from the owner to the other parents visiting. Highly highly recommend and we'll for sure be back!

Review: We LOVE this place! What you need to know:
1. It's clean! And safe.
2. It's not overstimulating - for most kids AND parents.
3. It's a reasonable size (you can actually have a conversation with another parent while keeping a close on your toddler).
4. The owners *truly* care. This is a small business, and the cost is worth it!

We tried Kids Wonder and other indoor play places, and really struggled with bigger kids (5+) running full speed, slick concrete floors, and spending too much money on maybe 2 hours of playtime.
This SUPER cute play place is toddler friendly, regulated, clean, and SO MUCH FUN! There is so much to do. My tiny two year old loves playing here, she'd spend literally the entire day here if she could. I really appreciate how much care, attention, and love the owners (who are lovely people) put into creating and maintaining this place. Now we just all have to do our parts to keep it this way 😉 through respect, care, and support.

Review: My son and I absolutely love this place. But Today we didn’t feel so welcome. My son is only a year and a half. He went to go play in the kitchen area where there was a lady with strawberry blonde hair in a ponytail and a sage green shirt. I think she was an owner or manager. My son went into The kitchen area where she was picking up. And of course he wanted to play. That is what this facility is made for right? Unfortunately, she got incredibly frustrated stormed out of the kitchen. Looked at male at front desk, spouted off that every time she tries to go pick up a kid destroys it. Then she snapped her fingers aggressively and says “like that”. She storms off. But my kid looked at her, the whole entire time. Remember he is only a year and a half old thinking he did something wrong by playing in a place where he was supposed to play. It breaks my heart because he does not see that behavior at home. We would like to come back, but we want to know it is a safe and welcoming environment for kids of all ages.

Review: Leaving a second review since my first review was deleted. This is a legit experience review. This was a disappointing experience. The place was way too crowded, not clean and unattended. Inappropriate loud club music. The glow in the dark didn’t have any chalk, the air tunnel was broke. I read in another review from 10 months ago that this was broke so either it wasn’t fixed or it breaks often.
The attendant/owner did not have gift cards, he said his wife knows more about that. The WiFi password didn’t work and he was gone for over 30 minutes and never showed up. I called the phone number but it went to vm asking to text an out of state phone number.
Is this locally owned???
There was absolutely so cleaning or sanitizing done that we could tell.
We were by the register several times to pay for a $2 package of cookies but after my phone call and several attempts to pay, my daughter and granddaughter walked out. That’s when the attendant ran out of nowhere. I asked for the WiFi password but his response was: “I’m more concerned with you paying for the cookies” I got the message loud and clear, you want my money but I shouldn’t expect anything from you. He then ran after my daughter and granddaughter and asked them: “is the cookies all you got?” This is very unprofessional behavior and insulting. I will not return and will make sure none one I know wastes their money here or get humiliated. Their competition is a much better choice, play street museum. See pic of unattended counter.

Post the vide where it shows my group left. How many in “my group” that left.
I never left or I would not have paid for the cookies. I didn’t steal anything I PAID FOR THE COOKIES!!!
Post the video of your attendant chasing after my 3 yr old granddaughter.
The “attendant” is your husband, that’s what he said.
Post videos of the “cleaning” never happened while we were there.
How do I “find” the attendant??? Post the videos of all the times I went to the counter and he never came out. If that’s not an indication that someone needs assistance, I don’t know what is.

Review: My 3 and 6 year old daughters enjoyed their time at Spark the Senses. The glow room is a fun new idea - and the water room too. My 3 year old loved the dinosaur dig sand box.
My only complaint is … let the parents have their coffee! We have been to many similar places and I have never been told I couldn’t drink my coffee (in a covered cup/mug) while my kids play. There was a lot of grumbling from other moms as I walked to put my coffee near the cubbies, so I know I’m not alone. Moms and dads are very careful not to spill our precious coffee!

Review: What can I say?!  This place is the BEST.  We had my daughter's birthday party there, we did the Premium Package, and it was worth every penny.  The staff is incredible, the attention to detail for her party was beyond anything I've ever seen (think professional party planner) and the facility itself was so clean and FUN!  We had 24 kids there (ages 2-6) and not a single one wanted to leave. We could easily spend a whole day there, and we will. We now have a membership.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!

Review: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4.75 stars. I took my 11 month old to Spark the Senses today, and I was a little nervous it would be super crowded with the holiday but it wasn't. My son had a blast. I appreciated the toy selection and it felt very clean. He did not want to leave and I ended up buying a 10 pack of visits. We didn't even get to play with everything yet we were there for 1.5 hrs. It was aesthetic and had a variety of Montessori toys. I loved the coffee and snack section too. The only slight downfall were the big kids in the baby area. I understand the kids who are there for siblings and parents in the baby area and in general it was fine. It just makes the small safe space feel a little stressful, but we just took those moments to leave that specific area and explore something new. The woman working was also so sweet and attentive. She was always cleaning and interacting with my son. He even started following her around  Im happy this place exists and I can't wait to be back!!

Review: We booked a private party for my son’s 3rd birthday at Spark the Senses and had an absolute amazing time! There were about 20 kiddos running around, ranging in ages from 1-5, and every single one of them had a blast! All the parents commented about how great the space was as well. There are tons of interactive toys, spaces to climb and run around, a water table area, a sand box, and even a glow room! Everything about this space is wonderful—and the best thing about it is how reasonable their pricing is!! Compared to other kids spaces I looked at booking for my son’s bday, STS had the BEST pricing packages for fully private parties! Karli was wonderful as well and super accommodating. 10/10 recommend.

Review: Oh my gosh, this place is an absolute gem! I was so thankful a weekend opened up so my little and I could come by. (Please open on the weekends more often). I find it way more enjoyable compared to another place that is twice as expensive and way too crowded. My little absolutely loved the black light room, along with playing kitchen. It was a slight fight to get her to leave. I felt like it wasn't too crowded at all. I choose the 930 time slot which worked out perfectly for us and our nap schedule.

As a millennial, I loved the music choice (pop), but I do recommend playing something more kid friendly and at a lower volume. Hearing ""Womanizer"" by Britney  Spears and ""TikTok"" by Kesha with lyrics ""brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack"" blasting was a little surprising. I'm definitely not offended, but others might be. I think the kids would enjoy Disney themed music or kidbop.

Review: This place fills a definite need for indoor play areas for toddlers and babies and my 3 year old enjoyed her time there. I think it's best suited for ages 4 and under. All of the exhibits were well thought out and kept clean, and we definitely didn't have the crowding issues reported in some of the reviews here. However, we went on a weekend where they designate certain time slots to open play in-between private events, and the slots were limited on the website when signing up, so they seem to have a good system in place for the weekends at least to limit crowding.

This might seem silly, but I have to dock a star for the two straight hours of pretty loud country music playing throughout our entire visit. I get that the owners can play whatever music they'd like, but that's definitely a specific choice/genre to play for the entire duration and I found it extremely grating and would've appreciated a bigger variety of music at a slightly lesser volume.

Review: This place was cute and fun but small for the amount of families that were there. My 13 month old did enjoy herself but it was just too crowded. When I was there, the glow room had so many parents in there chatting, it was hard to move around and enjoy it with my baby. It’s nice that they have a 2 and under area but this area should be monitored - so many big kids coming in and running around. It’s dangerous for the babies, especially the crawlers. We didn’t make it to the two hour mark because it was just overwhelming.

Review: My little guy (9 months) really enjoyed himself here. It was our first time checking this place out and the associate (possibly the owner?) was very friendly and did a relatively nice job of keeping the place clean. The water station was a bit dirty and did have an odor, suggesting it hadn't been cleaned out recently and I do think a policy about older kids being in the baby area should be in place. We had quite a few older kids come into the baby area to play and, given they have the majority of the playground's square footage already, there was no reason for them to be playing in there. And of course parents aren't going to parent and tell them to stay in their bigger kid section to let the babies play. The babies get such a small section as it is and it was pretty annoying to have older, non age-appropriate kids playing in there.

Our table was set and decorated before we got there with everything we needed and a welcome sign. We got to pick the color of plates and table cloth- they thought of all the small details like including wet wipes, hand sanitizers and even a lighter for the candles. Along with pizza, chips and water bottles were included for each child.
All the kids had a blast—they didn’t want to leave! The staff was super friendly and helpful the whole time. Check-in was fast and easy, I made sure to remind everyone to sign the waiver ahead of time. I definitely recommend WePlay for birthday parties or just a fun day out with the kids!

Very bad customer service, we never come back since then even though i keep receiving their messages about some discounts.

Review: We attended a birthday party at this facility, my 5 year old daughter went down the slide and landed in another child’s puke that had not been cleaned up. She was not the first nor last kid to get this puke on her. She was soaked through all her clothes in someone else’s bodily fluids and crying. All up and down her side, so soaked through her tights and sleeve of her dress.  When I asked if they by any chance had a lost and found or anything I could throw on her really quick so she wasn’t sitting in this, they let me know I could “purchase a shirt.” But that they would give us new socks for free.  This is not my definition of the cleanliness they tote, nor good protocol if a situation like this arises. I sent an email informing them of the situation and got no response. Maybe more staff so puke isn’t left sitting around? And complementary t shirts if a child is sitting in someone else’s fluids that were left unattended long enough for at least 5 kids to have the same outcome?

Review: We have celebrated 5 birthday parties here as well as a number of play dates! Our 5th party celebration was just yesterday! We love everything about We Play! Staff is always so amazing, friendly and genuinely care about you, your child and the experience you have, it is so much cleaner and well taken care of compared to any other child play place i have been to, pricing is so much more reasonable and affordable compared to other places, communication is always top tier, the fact it is also completely enclosed and you and your child are stamped the same to ensure complete safety within their establishment is a huge relief! Even when enforcing the rules to ensure everyone in the establishment is enjoying themselves in a safe environment, they are always kind. Every party/interaction we have had here has been nothing short of amazing. I consider the staff here my friends and I truly enjoy bringing my kids here for any reason and celebrating their birthdays! Personal shout out to Cassi, the manager, for always being so kind, genuine, understanding and amazing when scheduling all our parties. I always enjoy talking to her. Another shout out to each of our party hosts we have had for always being so accommodating and caring to all our needs. I also recently had the pleasure of meeting the owner, who was also extremely friendly, kind, caring and another genuinely amazing person running this establishment. They really go above and beyond to ensure you have the best experience possible.

Review: Sock police!!!! Some days they enforce the rules and some days they don’t.  Depends on who you get I guess.  It takes away from the overall experience, and puts everyone in a bad mood when all management is focusing on is the right foot attire.  This place has gotten more & more strict for what it is.

Review: ⭐ 0/5
We had a terrible experience at We Play on a rainy day with our 20-month-old. To start, the pricing is ridiculous. It cost us $17 for our child, $7 for one adult (the other was free), and then $2.99 each for “full grip socks” that we were forced to buy, even though my child already had grip socks that were deemed “not full grip.” Meanwhile, parents who were part of a birthday party were clearly wearing regular shoes without issue. When my husband mentioned he wouldn’t even enter the playground, they still insisted he purchase socks.

Once we got inside, it was utter chaos. There’s no structure or staff oversight. In the toddler section, my son tried to interact with another child while playing with a toy ice cream stand, only to be pushed repeatedly by the other child. This happened three times before the other parent finally intervened—after we called out for them. Most parents were sitting on the sidelines glued to their phones, oblivious to their kids’ behavior.

The worst part was in the “4 and under” section, where older kids were spinning dangerously fast on a toy, hanging off the sides and running recklessly around it. My son was simply walking nearby when they knocked him over. There was no staff monitoring this area, no one enforcing age limits, and no one available to address safety concerns.

This place is a disaster. If you’re looking for a safe, structured, and enjoyable environment for your child, do not come here. It’s overpriced, poorly managed, and unsafe. We will not be returning.

Review: We purchased the Summer Pass and came 4 days a week for 3 months! We came during busy times, slow times and birthday parties. The staff was always kind, the facility was always extremely clean and my kids enjoyed the playground & toys each and every time while improving their coordination. I have an almost 2 year old and a 4 year old but even our 12 year old niece loves this place. They have plenty of seating, allow you to access the internet and allow food. My only “complaint” would be that I wish the baby changing area had pull curtains for privacy but since the bathrooms for the mall are right across, it’s truly not a big deal.

Review: This place is way too overpriced and I had to pay $17 for my 1 year old child to enter in order for my older daughter to play. $43 for two hours of play and 1 pair of grippy socks is insane. Then I couldn’t help my 1 year old in the toddler section because I didn’t have grippy socks but my son was fine without them? My son could hardly do anything in the toddler area anyways and there was no infant friendly toys. I will stick with Jump for Joy down the street.

Mission accomplished for tiring out the kids 😜 you have to buy their socks but get to keep them so we will just bring them back with us. It was perfect for all ages honestly. I saw a lot of parents playing in it with their kids. There is also a four and under section for little kids. The food court is right next door if you want to bring something in with you while your kids play. We will definitely be back.

Review: We typically love coming here so much so that we have a membership. However, the last few times we have gone, there have been multiple sick children, which in return have caused my child to get sick. The kids are coughing up a lung and are allowed to just run around. The last time we were in there was a very apparently sick child she was coughing such a deep mucas sounding cough, and one of the employees knew them and didn't say anything, she knew not only the kid by name bht the parents as well. This makes me really not want to bring my child in anymore because we are always seeing the sick kids being allowed to be in there and playing. I guess since covid isn't as big of a deal anymore, the post covid rules for coming in sick don't apply anymore. It's very disappointing.

This is an entire racket. Overpriced and no bathrooms inside. If you're there with multiple kids while your wife shops you're expected to put everyone's shoes back on, and tote them to the bathroom located in the outer mall.  They don't offer much more than the city park. 2 stars because the staff were friendly and attentive.

Review: At first I was excited to see kids under 1 year old are free, and I totally understand the need to pay for special socks. However why is there a charge for a 2nd adult (who will just be standing there watching my baby play)? I just feel like that's quite unnecessary. I didn't end up going here after all because I just don't feel it's right to only let one parent come in for free.

We stayed for about 30mins, the rude employee made us feel unwelcomed and targeted so we opted to leave. Unfortunately, souring the experience so it wasn't worth the cost for us which is really too bad. Didn't even get to fully explore the area.

Seems like it's great for 2 and older kids. Fun idea for a birthday parties, and a great option during the winter months. Love the concept, just not the one staff member.

The arcade portion was nifty as well. The arcade portion was a lot more money than I expected.

The kids had fun though, so that's really all that matters in the end.

Thankfully it was an easy online purchase of the 2 kids tickets.

I did not purchase any food from their ""kitchen"", so I can't speak to that. However I did see quite a few people bring their own ""sack lunch"".

They had two ""party rooms"", which looked nice. I'm not sure what they supply for parties but at least you get a ""private"" room with a door for your gathering.

Review: Respectfully, please read.
1. This business is not a daycare, meaning; you as a parent are responsible for watching your children. The staff is assigned with other duties; attending to kids is not one of them. Yet, you are highly encouraged to advise the manger-on-site or a staff member if you notice any misdemeanor. There's a mic at the stage that the manager can use to pull the parents' attention towards their kids or announce emergencies, etc.
2. If you have a birthday party and you purchase a package with only 50 plates & forks, the party planners will set your order based off of the order sheet - Example: If your guests throw their plates or forks away after food and not have any left for cake, it's not the staff's fault. Please plan ahead or ask to purchase the additional items if you need more and they should be provided accordingly.
3. Everything should be accounted for. The staff are employees and cannot make financial decisions on behalf of the business, kindly do not ask for items without payment if they were not included on your party package.
4. Don't leave your shoes or your kid shoes laying around on the ground - there are cubbies for a reason.
Kids are free to run in this place and therefore it should be safe place and clear of any obstacle, including shoes.
6. If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to ask for the manager at site while you're there and they'll do their best to assist.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I hope it helps everyone have a better experience :)

The day we threw our party it seemed like they were understaffed my hosts were spread way too thin.  We were supposed to be out of our room by 4 PM, which we were but because the hosts did not start cleaning until 3:50 PM they did not have the room ready by 4. They automatically charged my card without even saying anything to me. They made up various lies that I was told we would be charged and warned to clean up 3 times. This NEVER happened. We started cleaning up on our own and had our first warning (which they claimed was the third) by the manager Judy.

About 4:10 PM my host asked if I wanted to take the ballons provided by the venue and I stepped in the room to grab them. They claim since I was briefly in the room at this time, I was over my party time. This is extremely unsettling because it seems like they are trying to trick their clients in order to charge them more for the overall party. The whole experience was unfortunately very negative. I spoke with Amy regarding the matter and even though she admitted the staff made some mistakes and warnings were never given there was no solution to my problem due to the above photo. I just don't think client should be charged for overage if this ensued due to their staffing delays.

Response from company reply:

I would never try and smear your name because I have only had great experiences until this point. I never resisted cleaning up and this is why I wrote this review.  To be accused of this, is very upsetting because it never happened. I was literally cleaning up when she came in the room.

After talking with the staff, Amy apologized to me that in fact that hosts never did ask me to clean and up and my first and only warning was by Judy. We were already cleaning when Judy came in but moved very quickly after this. I was recovering from surgery at the time so I moved as quickly as I could, but I had help from family as well. You also recognized that Judy never did okay this additional charge with me so the initial information you have was in fact false. I appreciate you owning these mistakes, but to still be charged for stepping into a room to grab ballons offered to me is ridiculous.

Review: My daughter really enjoyed her birthday party!! She was a Mal character fan, but now she’s a super fan. Mal (Grace) made the day!! The kids really enjoyed the character experience. We did the confetti , face painting , piñata , balloons and dance party with Grace !! Decorations were great. They were even able to accommodate for a dairy allergy!! Worth the price . I actually didn’t have to do anything except for book it. Which made things very easy for me.

We really enjoyed 'toddler Tuesdays' and can't wait for them to come back this fall. My son loves meeting all the new characters and the balloons he gets after the character visits. This is such a great place to have in the area and so useful on rainy days, really hot days, and the long winter months. We got the membership and found that it is pricey, but completely worth it if you'll be visiting more then 2x a month. We are so thankful we have this gem in Clarkston!

Review: This is a really nice place!  Cleaner and newer than your average fun place; everything is in good condition and looks nice and clean. The play structure is big enough, and there's a toddler area.  There is a bar that even has non-alcoholic Corona, plus the usual fun-food at fun-food prices. I paid $5.50 for a cup of fruit for my daughter and $3.50 for my coffee. $20 to load the game card for 10-15 games at the arcade. There is a play-until-you-win grabber game.  The birthday rooms on the side are combinable for large parties.  TV showing parent (dad) shows (Euro cup, Germany vs. Denmark).  Men/women/family restrooms were clean.  Disney music plays and a low volume so you can hear your children talk to you. I have not yet seen the live performance, I think that happens during the day when I'm at work. Mom takes the girls here during the day sometimes and that's when they saw the live Disney singing.

There aren’t enough words to convey how happy our entire party was . It was the perfect birthday party !!! Stephanie communicated  well and was prompt .

Review: Kudos to the manager on shift tonight! There was an incident involving my daughter and another child. My daughter repeatedly asked this child to remove his hands off of her leg as he was holding onto her and shaking her on the rope. She was scared. The child refused to stop! Once the child was identified, the manager was made aware of the situation because by this time the child had now now only grabbed my daughter and held onto her by the foot while shaking her he had also placed his hands on at least 3 other children.

The child's ""guardian"" was made aware that at this institution, we keep our hands to ourselves! Come to find out
1. The child did have disabilities (ok I get this and he has a difficult time understanding to keep his hands to himself) but now we ask! Where are the parents!?!
2. Said child was with a BABYSITTER!
3. After manager speaks to child and babysitter the parents of child call and scream at the manager.

Let's get things straight, if I were in your shoes and my daughter had disabilities and needed DIRECT SUPERVISION so I could intervene if she was placing her hands on others id make sure I was SUPERVISING MY CHILD!  I would not blame the manager for addressing my child for placing hands on others. That's her job! Keep kids safe and having fun in a safe environment!

I would also be questioning who is babysitting my child because while your babysitter was sitting on her a$$ your child was hitting a 2 year old!

Again. Kudos to the manager for addressing the situation as soon as it was brought to her attention. Thank you for helping my daughter feel safe and welcome. And just thank you for being you. I'm horrible with names and I cannot remember if she said it was Julie or Judy. But either way. Your an amazing manager. You have the patience of a saint and I appreciate you.

To the parents of the child who needs to be taught to keep their hands to their selves because regardless of a disability or not, this does not give your child the right to place his hands on my daughter. No means no. I hope you find a babysitter who actually watches your children instead of sitting on one of those comfy chairs and plays on her phone the entire time.

The staff is all super friendly, the snacks we got were yummy, and we felt like we got our money’s worth. My only feedback is that it might be fun to have a disco light and a dance floor where the character stage is when there aren’t any characters during that time. It was a bit difficult to keep the toddlers out of the roped off area when not in use.

Review: This is not the place to go to just play in an indoor playground if it's crowded. It's not on the grand scale of like a Chuck E Cheese that can be busy and yet still seem like there's room and you're not tripping over each other or trying to find your child through the crowd. Being a smaller place, when it's crowded and kids are all on the same thing, trying to go down the same slide, waiting to play one of the arcade games, etc, then what was going to be a fun time turns into chaos. I spent more time trying to see them thru the crowd and keep them off of other kids, to not take cuts, to be careful, or telling them they had to be patient to wait for this game and with younger kids that's just becomes a headache. I think it's great for a birthday party, again, try and set that party up for when it's not crowded/busy. Where it shines is the stage and special events it hosts. I've talked to many friends who have went there for the special events and have just loved it. The pizza bar & food prices are typical of this type of place but it does have a coffee and drinking bar for the adults which is nice. Overall I think it's great for the special events and birthday parties if you can get them at a down time. IMO I just don't think it's a place you can decide to just jump in the car and go. Because of its size, w/ younger kids it's too small for ""anytime I want to go"" play.

Review: Umm well where do I start.  The place had a lot of potential.  According to its name you would think the place would be themed with wall to wall princess themed everything.  Unfortunately the building was lack luster at best.  The playscape was your typical McDonald's playscape maybe twice its size.  They had a teeny tiny infant/toddler area.  They had video games.  They had a princess who came out for the birthday party and played with the kids and made balloon animals and painted the kids faces.  The building/walls/carpet/food needs to be modified into a more princess themed decor

Review: Remember those McDonald’s play places in the 90’s where you’d dive into the ball pit and come out with a dirty bandaid stuck in your hair? This place is not that, thankfully! It seemed very clean and also a lot of netting so you don’t really lose sight of your kids. Spider-Man was there and my son loved it. My daughter has been to a princess one as well with her cousin. Could be a good option for a parent who works from home, as they have a seating area with tables where you could camp out, watch your kid, and yet still get stuff done as they are burning energy.
I also like that they seem to be on top of things for safety. My daughter removed her wrist band in the bathroom before we left because she got it wet washing her hands, and I didn’t know we needed to keep them on for leaving. The woman at the counter stopped us and asked about the lack of wristband, and asked to see pictures of her with me and made sure that she was my daughter. Good to know they aren’t letting anyone walk out with kids.
Worth the price and would go back.

Review: Super disappointed in our experience today. We took our three year old today and lasted about 20 minutes before having to leave. In the toddler area there were multiple kids without parents. One parent was at the bar section the entire time while her kids were causing problems in the toddler play area. Another little boy told my three year old daughter to take her clothes off so they could have some real fun. Kids were biting and everything. We told the lady working the front desk (which I get it isn’t her fault) and she said parents are irresponsible and she can’t help it because they aren’t her kids. There wasn’t a single worker watching the play area. The idea is super fun but with zero supervision from employees and no supervision requirement for parents, I would avoid this place at all costs.

We loved this place when we first discovered it because it's so hard to find a place to just safely release a 2-year-old to let them discover.

They seem to have given up entirely about putting a gate securely around the area, so it's too stressful going here and having a constantly hover and corral a toddler back into the area.

Review: I did not think the Easter Egg hunt went well. It was supposed to start at 10, they kept holding up and delaying starting because people kept walking in. You’re late, we all shouldn’t be held up because of that. And the entrance getting in was a cluster! There has got to be a better check in process so there’s not a huge overwhelming crowd at the door.

Our daughter was in the toddler section and due to the cluster of kids and their parents (which parents were picking up eggs for their kids) she only got a couple eggs. It was way too crowded in that little area. Either limit tickets sold or the parents need to stay out of the area. It was chaotic!

I don’t want to hold this one event against them though. They had the Easter bunny and Spider-Man which was a huge hit with all of the kids. I do look forward to going back on a non event day. The space is clean and the bar and snack bar are a nice touch. Just trying to offer some constructive feedback!

Review: When we arrived we were asked if we had socks. The adults did not. They said no big deal you can purchase them. Great. They rang us up - the kids ran off and then we were told they were out of adult socks and we can’t cross the orange line. Um ok the kids already ran off and now I can’t even go sit and watch them… are you kidding me? So I proceed to stand next to the orange line the best I can while my husband runs to target - thank goodness it’s close. Meanwhile - lady walks in with her dirty wet snow boots - crosses the orange line AND walked onto the play floor. Are you kidding me? I was livid. I didn’t have socks but at least I wasn’t tracking nasty water through the play area.

Despite my better judgement, we went back 5 months later. We brought socks this time 😬. The front staff was beyond rude. There was two people on their phones playing games and couldn’t even be bothered to put them down while ringing us up. I’m not even sure what I paid for as it was never explained to me. I had two kids and one hour free play card and it still cost me $35. Pretty pricey since we were only staying an hour anyways.

Review: Edit: I’m giving 2 more stars, because despite my child’s boredom, she has mentioned it a few times asking to go back (with another child) so clearly more fun than she let on.

My 5 year old was so bored here we had to leave after 20 mins. This place is only slightly more engaging than a free chick fila play area, and definitely not as engaging as a real playground. I was very disappointed. Maybe if you bring more than one kid it might be better. They also don’t have water or food to purchase (or at least not on the day we visited). I would say this might be ideal for 3 year olds, but not the cutoff age of 6. Also the party prices were way too high for this venue.

Review: Staff is friendly and structure is fine, it would be nice if they changed up some of the options or at least made sure the options available were fully functioning (plane simulator). I get that they are a small business but to charge almost $20 for 1 child and not even giving a discount for walking in an hour before they close is unfortunate. Also their toy machine is ""sleeping on the weekends"" is also ridiculous, stop being cheap and you might get more repeat business.

Perfect middle ground to me.

The plane simulator should consider screen recording some Microsoft flight sim footage of our area but other than that I have no notes lol.

Review: I want to love this place, but the swing in the middle of the playroom is a major issue. When a child swings, they hit others, and since many of the kids are toddlers without much awareness, I saw numerous children getting struck (my own included) and parents having to pull them out of the way. The swing is positioned directly in the middle of the playroom, blocking the entrance to the play structure, so kids have to dodge it to get in. My one-year-old can’t walk and play freely because she’s at risk of being hit. I hoped the swing would be addressed on my recent visit, but it hasn’t been changed. The lack of staff oversight makes me hesitant to return

Review: We joined this play space about 7-8 months ago, it was so fun. The staff were friendly and whilst being strict, they let kids be kids and play.
We haven’t been in a long time and it’s like they don’t want kids to play anymore. I’m a very strict mom as I have 4 kids and I am very much Type A, but after today, I’m thinking I’m a softy!
If they’re not allowed to spin on the silk swing, then maybe don’t put it up. In the same breath, other kids used the swing exactly the same way as mine and didn’t once get told off.
It’s summer - I get it, everyone’s a bit frustrated with noisy boisterous kids, but this is an indoor kids play space where maybe 8 other kids were playing alongside mine. They were all completely fine - no need to be so snappy.

Review: Overall my kids love the place and the gals running  the front desk are great.   The reason for the 4-star and not 5 is the new sock policy where they charge you $3 for 25 cent disposable socks.   At least the rec center provides quality socks for the same price.   It’s a bummer to see good businesses trying to make money on minuscule things like this.   A better business model would be to provide these cheap socks free of charge until everyone is aware of the new policy.  Or at least provide something of better quality.

As others have said, the simulator is just a video on loop. The thing I didn't enjoy the most was how loud the music was on top of all the children being loud/screaming - very overstimulating.

Review: This place is NOT disability friendly. My daughter wears AFOS (ankle braces) to be able to get around. The safest way for her to wear them is with shoes on. I always alert staff at places like this when we arrive and this is the first time a toddler play place treated us like second class citizens. I explained to the staff working that her AFOS are medical devices and they looked back and forth at each other. They did let her wear her shoes, but subjected me to a 2 minute lecture on safety. Essentially mom shaming me for even requesting my kid have an accommodation to play with her peers. Absolutely disgusted with the staff.

Besides the staff being ridiculously rude when it comes to disabilities it’s a great place to play for a 2 year old.

Review: I wish I could give them more than 5 stars! We had my son's 5th birthday here and it was just the best! Since there were no parties scheduled before or after ours they let us into the private room early and let us stay as long as we wanted at no extra change. They helped with anything and everything that we asked about. They were so friendly and it was such a cool setup.

The party room has a window so you can watch your kids while they play. The play equipment is great for a large age range. The flight theme is fun and different. The place is large enough that it's fun, but small enough that it's easy to keep track of your kids.

They also had family restrooms and a nursing room. It is so family friendly.

The kids are all given wristbands and they get unlimited play for as long as they want  (even after the party is over).

Finally, it's a family owned business and they make it feel that way. They even cleaned the room at then end. They just went above and beyond!

Review: Update: we purchased a 3 month membership and are very happy with the value. Also, a single visit here is more affordable than the MAC for younger kids. The MAC charges for adults too so total ends up being $32 vs $18 here.

Fun, bright place to let your toddlers/kids burn some energy. Most kids places charge for the day. This place is pretty pricey ($18) for not letting you re-enter later in the afternoon. I hope they change that, but the membership is appealing... And they've improved some of the play stuff since opening.

I drove 30+ minutes down there to see a sign on the door that they closed early. I called today to ask for my money back and they told me that the pass doesn’t expire, I can use it any time, but they cannot give me a refund. I explained I don’t live close, was disappointed with my experience, but still, no refund. I’m sure it’s a cool place and will come back to use the pass I paid for in the future, but I’m not satisfied with the customer service I received with the business at this time.

Review: It's great for toddlers and young kids. My kids had a lot of fun and for that reason, I might consider coming back. We checked it out on a Saturday which I know probably isn't the best time to go. I was surprised at how many adults and kids they allowed in at once. It was overcrowded in the play area and the sitting area. Pricing is also on the higher side. Not only for single admission but membership too. For your money, there are plenty of better options with more to offer for play and learning, more space, and less crowded. I'm not opposed to coming back when it's less busy but the price alone makes me willing to look elsewhere.

Review: I’m all about supporting small business, and if I can do that while keeping my two kids entertained — awesome!
Unfortunately, Kids Landing was less than ideal.
$30+ for two kids to try to play in a very small area that was overcrowded. I’d say the best thing Kids Landing could offer is a limit of how many kids at once, or time slots? We were there for about an hour before a private party also accompanied the already 18 kids there, which added another 12 kids. This place simply cannot handle crowds of this size, nor does it have enough to do to occupy that many.
Great idea for Castle Rock, but not a great location, along with everything inside feeling lackluster.

Review: I was super excited to take my little one to the Kids Landing. Unfortunately I cannot recommend it and will not be coming back. It is $18 for one child! That is more expensive than children's museum and it's definitely not worth it. It is literally one play structure which was hard for my 3 year old to navigate by himself and questionable safety-wise as there are open holes. There was maybe 7 other children playing while we were there and it was so loud (again, one room). The ""flight simulator"" had like one button for children to push and didn't even do anything - so like the other reviewer mentioned, to advertise this as a feature is quite the stretch. Castle Rock needs an indoor playground for young children but as it stands, this isn't it.

This isn't just for big kids, my 1.5 year old was able to climb inside and up the entire structure.  Once she slid down one of the slides, she was hooked.  I really like the idea of a membership and that they control how many kids are in the play area at one time.   We can't wait to host a birthday party in the banquet room.  Overall 10/10 for fun.

Review: What a wonderful new addition to Castle Rock! We attended the grand opening with my 8 year old and 13 month old and both enjoyed their time so much! My youngest enjoyed playing at the tables with blocks and my oldest absolutely loved the play structure. I appreciate the attention to detail for kiddos as well as parents, everything here has been so well thought out. So much room for kids to run and play, and a nice seating area for parents to relax while keeping a close eye on the kids. The party room is bright and spacious!  I will definitely be back to enjoy this indoor play space with all three of my daughters (the middle one was bummed she missed out on all the fun)!

Review: This is one of the best things that has ever come to castle rock! Based on the overwhelming attendance to the grand opening, shows how much this was needed and welcomed. The owners being locals and already involved in the community shows they know what castle rock needed. If you are looking for a safe, clean, welcoming place for your kiddos to learn and enjoy aviation you will not be disappointed!

Review: The Kids Landing is such a necessary need for Castle Rock and boy does it deliver BIG!! I swear they have thought of everything- from a toddler play area to a flight simulator section to the play structure even being parent friendly! Wow!! As a mom of 2 under 2 I am limited with where I can take my kids and it be somewhere affordable, small kid friendly, easy access for parents to play or supervise their kids, and not have to drive 20+ minutes to. My daughter is 21 months and she LOVED it! The toddler area was perfect for containment and getting her comfortable before wanting to venture to the play structure. She wasn’t brave enough to go on her own, so my husband (who is 6 feet tall) went with her. He was able to navigate through the entire play structure with ease (which is SUPER impressive since most structures are small, cramped, and definitely only for kids which IMO isn’t great for the small ones who still need mom or dad’s help). After she went through the structure and down the slides one time we couldn’t pry her away. My husband and I took turns going through with her (I’m 5’3” and had no issues going through which is no surprise since my husband-again 6 feet tall- was able to run around with my daughter as well). She LOVED our time there and we will definitely become members. Perfect timing since winter is right around the corner and we need all the great indoor ideas and places. Will definitely be frequenting here and adding to our weekly routine. My daughter’s birthday is in January and it’s so hard to find things to do indoors that isn’t at our house. We will be renting the event room for sure!! It’s the perfect size and the glass walls allow parents to enjoy themselves and watch their kids. I am SO thankful for a safe, locally run and owned indoor play place for our kiddos. The owners are also such wonderful people. I love that they live here and want to invest in making Castle Rock better. The prices are more than reasonable and honestly could probably be higher so myself (and bank account) are thankful it’s more than affordable. Such an amazing addition to our community! Support local and enjoy your new favorite place to take your kiddos!!

Side note- I am not a fan of snacks with the first ingredient being high fructose corn syrup or that have massive amounts of added sugar. It’s refreshing to see an establishment that provides healthy snacks kids still love. Dried apples (or fruits) are favorites in my house and I haven’t met a kid that doesn’t like them. & thinking of the parents with protein bars, genius!! We need fuel too and rarely do I remember to pack snacks for me so THANK YOU!!
I also appreciate the no alcohol policy-  as a parent who expects other parents to “parent” their children instead of using play areas for babysitting while they drink, this is the type of place I want to support.

Lastly- I’m sorry for the previous review. It was distasteful and not a truthful representation of your facility. I personally know you’re local and native to Colorado . Plus, no one should make public comments about your marriage when they do not know you or your financial/marital situation.

It was wonderful being able to sit down and watch them the entire time and not have to run after them wondering where they disappeared to. We had to leave after an hour and a half and neither kid was ready. I’ll plan to go for at least two hours next time! This will certainly be a place we frequent especially in the colder months to get the wiggles out and have fun. Thank you for building a play place for kids in Castle Rock!

Review: Attended the open house and saw dozens of kids having the time of their lives, in a bright, colorful, well thought-out play place  This is such an essential venue for this growing, family-centric, community. As a bonus, the owners are Castle Rock residents...with small children of their own...and have been for years. They are following an age-old business maxim, ""find a consumer need, and fill it.""  Wishing much success to this venture.

My 4 year old son played on the play structure, slid down the slide, played with the lights and soft blocks and even the little blocks on the table and didn’t come up to me the entire hour+ we were there-not even to ask for a snack-that’s a win!!! The owners were very sweet and friendly. We will definitely be back to check it out!

Our 5 year old loved the play gym, and our 2 year old had a blast in the soft play area. The venue is clean, well thought, and would be a great place to host a children's birthday party as the event room is wisely placed in the center with large windows to watch your little ones enjoy the amenities. We’re so happy for this new addition and will be visiting again soon! Definitely recommend.

Review: Cute boutique play club for young children. Ideal 6mo-5yr age ranges. There's a little separate area for babies and the rest of the space is free play for other young children. It is kept very clean and organized throughout the day. I appreciate that there is something like this in walla walla to allow kids to play when it's too cold or too hot outside, which is seemingly 10 months out of the year. They offer various membership options to fit any preference of frequency of facility use and there are options for renting out for parties and other events are hosted by owners here for members. Overall a great small business that I hope thrives in our town!

Review: We’ve tried our fair share of indoor play places and this is my favorite indoor play place by far. The owners are so kind and do such a great job keeping the place tidy even when it’s packed with kiddos. Another thing I like is they are always changing the layout, so while the larger items may be the same, it always looks new when we come into a new layout. Some places we have been to can be so large that I lose sight of my kid if I’m not watching too carefully, but here it’s the perfect size I never lose track of him if I’m in a conversation and he walks away. They even have a room in the back for arts and crafts, dress up and eating if you want to feed your little one here. 10/10 recommend!

It had a great densely laid out soft play area for young kids. The kids had fun and it appeared clean, but 10 minutes in I was asked to wait outside since it was too busy. 1. Don’t over admit if it’s too crowded. 2. There were several other parents with 1 kid, but i was the only one asked to wait outside.

I don't usually repost things but as a parent, I can't not warn / notify other parents
We had our daughter's birthday here after this horrific incident and had no idea until this vague post by Jungle Playland posted today...we would not have rescheduled her party here or supported this business another day after this incident or how they horribly and unprofessionally handled the whole situation.. we are sick about this..
Just a heads up in case others parents here have taken their children here or plan to..
Heartbroken and prayers for the affected children and families💔

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: As a restaurant owner, I am not typically one to leave bad reviews—but I absolutely have to address something that happened today. I purchased a $16 cheese and fruit plate that was full of old/bruised fruit. I kindly asked if they could remake the plate because my children have sensory issues and wouldn’t eat the fruit. When they remade it, they gave us less than HALF the food that was on the original plate. When I asked them where the rest of the cheese was, they said “the cheese assortment is at random, that’s just how we do it.” It was insanely busy and I didn’t want to cause any delays for other families, but I am SO disappointed. They served me slivers of apple peels on the second plate, FOUR crackers, and a small pile of Swiss cheese that my children obviously wouldn’t eat. I feel like they did this deliberately, as the employees looked annoyed I even brought the plate to their attention. For $16, food should be fresh and stored properly to avoid bruising and spoiling. They would not give me a refund. Though my kids love this place, I don’t think we’ll be visiting again because of the blatant disrespect. I spend hundreds of dollars here a month, so I expected a little more kindness and care. The first photo is what they initially served me, and the second photo is what the replacement plate had on it.

Review: This place is a great place for parents to hang out with other parents, and kids to hang out with other kids. Reminds me of old McDonald's play pits, just big enough for adults to climb in with their younger children to help them down bigger slides. They have really cheap coffee. Not so cheap beer and junk food snacks which are okay. Honestly, the best part about this place is how tired it makes my kid so that he goes to bed easy at night.

The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in months, the toilet seat cover holder was pulled off the wall and laying on the floor, toilets were stained with urine, trash and filth everywhere, no trash bag in the trash can! The health department needs to be called. I would not allow my child to use this restroom. We left immediately. Get your shit together and hire enough staff to clean! Bathrooms should be checked every 30 mins. Wish I had taken a photo but I could not get out of there fast enough. Gross.

Review: This place was so much fun! The price was quite fair, I  spent two hours playing with my kiddo in the tower. There were other adults playing with their kids in there too. A good time was had by all. The staff do their best to maintain it, and we overheard some of them complain they didn’t have the right dusters to get some of the tops of the slides despite their best efforts. They did their best to keep it clean and tidy. The lattes were good, and staff were friendly and courteous.

One bizarre thing in a play center for kids under 3: no changing table or bin in men's toilets. Guess changing diapers is something only women do

Review: This place is ideal for playdates, but the cement floor by the tables is a concern. Children tend to slip and fall while walking or running to get a drink, particularly since they often don't wear shoes when quickly grabbing water. I've witnessed numerous slips and falls. It would be great if they installed a floor more suitable for kids. The staff is extremely friendly.

Review: They treat customers differently. We were told 15 min set up prior, then at 1:45 they were rushing us out of the room, saying it was booked, no one showed for 2 hours after, the next door room was in  30 min early setting up, and was still in 20 min after our time were supposed to be out buy. They charged us for graffiti balloons and never said anything about it, they gave us flack as kids didnt go in the play area as most of them were under 3 yrs old. Customer services was bad. Grandson 1st bday, the guy didn't even know how to cut a cake, as we were not allowed to touch knifes. Then he left it on the table.

Review: The staff was friendly enough but it’s super dirty in the play structure, piles of trash between the climbing areas and exposed sharp zip ties all over the places where kids slide and play. It’s VERY dark inside the structure which makes it hard to see when kids are coming and going- an accident waiting to happen.

Be warned- in the toddler area, the netting above is connected to the big kids play area- when they run overhead the netting sags and can super easily lead to a kids full weight slamming down onto your head.

This place is not worth breaking your neck over

That said- my little one had fun

Review: The indoor play place is great for kids, a little pricey for what it is.
However, the food... The food is GROSS. I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar wrap. Brown lettuce, squishy wilted tomatoes, and the chicken was clearly precooked and bought that way. They're going to make someone sick!
The pizza was ok, very greasy. My kids did not eat very much.
I would go back for the play area but I won't eat there again.

Update: We booked a birthday party here and it went great. They had run of out invites when we stopped by and I don't think anyone reached out to us about the food order like the email said but I might've just missed the call. It wasn't a big deal. I was able to place the food order a few days before and we didn't run into any problems with that. The host was very friendly and attentive. All of the kids had a blast. We will probably do a birthday party here again next year if that's what our kid wants to do.

Review: This is a good place for kids, I guess. My child is autistic and he is tempted to play there. Never plays longer than 10 min. Minimum pay stated on the card $10.50. Counter is closed and you have to walk to their cafeteria to pay. My request to pay for 30 minutes rejected. Been asked to pay $11.42 with explanation that price is raised. Weird amount. Always paid rounded number before. I assumed that caused by my ""stupid"" request. Of course I will go again and pay $15, 20, 30 so on because my son wants to play 5-10 minutes and it is some fun gor him.  Five stars for a good idea and place minus two stars for suspicious pricing and ""rude"" redirection on the empty counter.

Review: No WIFI. When I messaged them asking why, no response. Seems silly for a place like this not to have some connectivity for parents who are hanging out while kids play.

Otherwise, they have laser tag every last Friday of the month - unless a private party reserves that laser tag session, then everyone else is out of luck. Problem is, there's no way to know until you get there.

This happened to us last week (kiddo was heartbroken), at which time we were lied to and told there will be another laser tag session the following week. I mean, why lie?

Food is mediocre at best. Staff isn't all that friendly (though I wouldn't expect teenagers working in that environment would be).

Definitely won't be going back.

I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: It's fun for kids, however I wish they restricted by age, not height. My son is only 5 and he's in the 97% for height so he is right at the top of the ruler for measuring. Seems a little unfair, especially since his cousin is 7 and very very short and is no where near the top of the measurement ruler.

Playground equipment, kitchen toy, kids tables, book & carpet area, big blocks and 2 bouncy houses. Table and chairs along the wall for easy supervision.
No food or beverage allowed in the playroom.

You can rent a room in front of the playroom for a birthday party etc. $50/h, minimum 2 hours. The playroom remains open to everybody even if you rent the room for a party.

It's free with a military ID but I've heard people complaining about the fact that food isn't supposed to be brought in (because allergies are a thing!!)

My wish is that they open during hours I can take my son during the week. I believe they close at 11am or 12pm during the week and I'm at work during that time. That said, my son can only enjoy the benefits of Sounders on the weekends. No place can be perfect but Sounders is pretty close. Add a grill and soft drinks and we'd never leave, lol.

Prices were good, especially with the summer kids bowl free program.

The same machine did the same thing to my wife's ball and my friend's. Terrible bowling alley. Only good thing about it is the workers in the food area. They are super cool and provide excellent service every time.

Review: We love coming here. It is a great space for our 2 year old to play with other kids while we have a coffee. The only suggestion is that we wish they would get new toys in occasionally. We have been coming for almost a year now (about 2x a month) and it seems to be the same toys. I think it would really keep people coming in and kids more interested if they would rotate new toys every now and then.

** Upated review 2 weeks later.  Thank you for listening to my review! We came back last week and saw many new toys, and our son loved it and had a great time. We appreciate you being on top of it and listening to your customers, I updated the review to 5 stars, and will continue to come enjoy the café!

Coffee was good, I ordered a chicken pesto Panini and although I thought $9 was a tiny bit much, it was delicious. We will definitely be back. They have a great party room and packages too.

Review: Good except:  The toys are strewn everywhere, no longer giving each station a theme.  I cleaned up the kitchen and laundry area so my grandaughter could play.   Both employees were busy making food and cashiering.  The focus needs to be shifted to the child's experience, not the adult's food and beverages.  Hire an employee dedicated to walk around and put back scattered toys.

Review: I recently visited PlayCafe with my two young children, and I have to say, it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. Owners Matt and Michelle have truly created a haven that perfectly caters to both children and their parents.

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that Matt and Michelle understand the unique needs of young families. The play area is incredibly well-designed, with a variety of safe, engaging activities that kept my kids entertained for hours. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully arranged to spark imagination and encourage active play, from the colorful climbing structures to the creative play stations.

What truly sets PlayCafe apart, though, is how well they accommodate parents. The seating area is comfortable and strategically placed so that you can keep an eye on your little ones while enjoying a well-deserved break. The café offers a great selection of refreshments, from freshly brewed coffee to healthy snacks, making it easy to relax and refuel.

Moreover, the entire facility is impeccably clean and well-maintained, which is a testament to the care and dedication Matt and Michelle put into their business. They are always on hand to greet you with a warm smile and are genuinely invested in ensuring that every family has a positive experience.

In a world where finding a place that both children and parents can enjoy equally is rare, PlayCafe stands out as a true gem. It's clear that Matt and Michelle have poured their hearts into creating a space that understands and meets the needs of families. I highly recommend PlayCafe to anyone looking for an all-around great place for kids to play and parents to relax. We will definitely be returning soon!

Review: My little guy was a member here for a few months this winter, and he looks forward to going every time. Toys and play structures are thoughtful and high quality. The staff are kind, and they do a good job cleaning and tidying despite the chaos of many many kiddos.

My only complaint is that their food options for kids are really dairy-heavy and light on whole foods, and they don't allow outside food. My son doesn't really eat anything they offer, which limits the amount of time and money we spend when we visit.

Review: I’ve been here a few times and things were great at first. My daughter loved it. But I took my daughter there last week and there seemed to be a lot of toys missing compared to what was there before. There was also broken toys and the biggest thing was that there was an outlet to plug things in that was right in the middle of the whole play area which was uncovered. What a hazard for the kids. Won’t be taking my daughter here again.

Review: We did the DIY party package for my daughters birthday. We arrive 30min before the party to set up the decorations. We weren’t allowed to really help any (for liability reason) but this also put a restraint on the party starting at 4. Only the birthday girl was allowed in the play area until everyone could get checked in. Other kids weren’t allowed in until maybe 15 or 20 minutes past 4 (my paid time) due to decorations needing to be put up first. If this was the case I would say 2 workers should have been available rather than 1. I feel it took away from my paid time from the party, especially since the play area closes 30min before the due time (4-6) for clean up. That’s understandable, but not allowing other kids in until check in past the party start time was my only complaint. Other than that, the kids had a blast.

The drop-in pricing is fair, and there are several membership or punchcard options for even more savings.
We homeschool and I’m very excited to be able to bring my older son and work one-on-one with him while the younger kiddos are engaged in play close by.
Also, they are testing out staying open until 8pm on Friday nights. We popped back in with dad in the evening for a local beer and some more play time, did not disappoint!

My kids played safely for 2 hours while I typed reports and sipped a fantastic wine.  Lots of moms were in the play area and I noticed no fights over toys or bullying.  The owner stays were he can easily view all the kids as well, so this place is really safe.

Review: Loved the playground but I would suggest this business reconsider their policy on bringing food in. We came so that our son can play not to eat off of a super limited menu mostly consisting of basic sandwiches and children’s food. There are 8 restaurants within walking distance and we would’ve happily stayed longer had I been able to go get food and bring it in. In other words eat before you arrive but they do have lots of options for young children

Review: Highly recommend Play/Cafe to friends with small kids! Such a sweet set up, perfect for those encouraging imaginative play with montessori toys or just wanting their children to have more social interaction with others.

Basically a mini kids museum in Yakima❣

My 13 month old & his 2 year old cousin had a blast! We will certainly be visiting again soon.

We ended up doing our child’s birthday party at the We Play in the Spokane Valley Mall, and it was probably the smoothest birthday party we’ve ever done! They did all the set up and cleanup, all we had to do was bring cupcakes and a present. They took care of the pizza order and handled everything extremely professionally and well. Highly recommended! You won’t be disappointed.

Review: We had our child’s birthday party at WePlay and it was awesome! The whole place was super clean and well maintained, especially the big play structure!! There was even a special area just for younger kids, which was great for our little ones and made it easy to keep track of them.
Our table was set and decorated before we got there with everything we needed and a welcome sign. We got to pick the color of plates and table cloth- they thought of all the small details like including wet wipes, hand sanitizers and even a lighter for the candles. Along with pizza, chips and water bottles were included for each child.
All the kids had a blast—they didn’t want to leave! The staff was super friendly and helpful the whole time. Check-in was fast and easy, I made sure to remind everyone to sign the waiver ahead of time. I definitely recommend WePlay for birthday parties or just a fun day out with the kids!

Review: 0 star if i could. They refused to let me sit in the waiting area (it was empty) even though i was very pregnant. They said only one parent is allowed to come inside to watch the kid. Then they forced my husband to buy socks even though he had his own socks and he was not going into the structure. We left after my son playing for only 5 minutes. Very bad customer service, we never come back since then even though i keep receiving their messages about some discounts.

Review: We attended a birthday party at this facility, my 5 year old daughter went down the slide and landed in another child’s puke that had not been cleaned up. She was not the first nor last kid to get this puke on her. She was soaked through all her clothes in someone else’s bodily fluids and crying. All up and down her side, so soaked through her tights and sleeve of her dress.  When I asked if they by any chance had a lost and found or anything I could throw on her really quick so she wasn’t sitting in this, they let me know I could “purchase a shirt.” But that they would give us new socks for free.  This is not my definition of the cleanliness they tote, nor good protocol if a situation like this arises. I sent an email informing them of the situation and got no response. Maybe more staff so puke isn’t left sitting around? And complementary t shirts if a child is sitting in someone else’s fluids that were left unattended long enough for at least 5 kids to have the same outcome?

Review: We have celebrated 5 birthday parties here as well as a number of play dates! Our 5th party celebration was just yesterday! We love everything about We Play! Staff is always so amazing, friendly and genuinely care about you, your child and the experience you have, it is so much cleaner and well taken care of compared to any other child play place i have been to, pricing is so much more reasonable and affordable compared to other places, communication is always top tier, the fact it is also completely enclosed and you and your child are stamped the same to ensure complete safety within their establishment is a huge relief! Even when enforcing the rules to ensure everyone in the establishment is enjoying themselves in a safe environment, they are always kind. Every party/interaction we have had here has been nothing short of amazing. I consider the staff here my friends and I truly enjoy bringing my kids here for any reason and celebrating their birthdays! Personal shout out to Cassi, the manager, for always being so kind, genuine, understanding and amazing when scheduling all our parties. I always enjoy talking to her. Another shout out to each of our party hosts we have had for always being so accommodating and caring to all our needs. I also recently had the pleasure of meeting the owner, who was also extremely friendly, kind, caring and another genuinely amazing person running this establishment. They really go above and beyond to ensure you have the best experience possible.

Review: ⭐ 0/5
We had a terrible experience at We Play on a rainy day with our 20-month-old. To start, the pricing is ridiculous. It cost us $17 for our child, $7 for one adult (the other was free), and then $2.99 each for “full grip socks” that we were forced to buy, even though my child already had grip socks that were deemed “not full grip.” Meanwhile, parents who were part of a birthday party were clearly wearing regular shoes without issue. When my husband mentioned he wouldn’t even enter the playground, they still insisted he purchase socks.

Once we got inside, it was utter chaos. There’s no structure or staff oversight. In the toddler section, my son tried to interact with another child while playing with a toy ice cream stand, only to be pushed repeatedly by the other child. This happened three times before the other parent finally intervened—after we called out for them. Most parents were sitting on the sidelines glued to their phones, oblivious to their kids’ behavior.

The worst part was in the “4 and under” section, where older kids were spinning dangerously fast on a toy, hanging off the sides and running recklessly around it. My son was simply walking nearby when they knocked him over. There was no staff monitoring this area, no one enforcing age limits, and no one available to address safety concerns.

This place is a disaster. If you’re looking for a safe, structured, and enjoyable environment for your child, do not come here. It’s overpriced, poorly managed, and unsafe. We will not be returning.

The staff was always kind, the facility was always extremely clean and my kids enjoyed the playground & toys each and every time while improving their coordination. I have an almost 2 year old and a 4 year old but even our 12 year old niece loves this place. They have plenty of seating, allow you to access the internet and allow food. My only “complaint” would be that I wish the baby changing area had pull curtains for privacy but since the bathrooms for the mall are right across, it’s truly not a big deal.

Review: This place is way too overpriced and I had to pay $17 for my 1 year old child to enter in order for my older daughter to play. $43 for two hours of play and 1 pair of grippy socks is insane. Then I couldn’t help my 1 year old in the toddler section because I didn’t have grippy socks but my son was fine without them? My son could hardly do anything in the toddler area anyways and there was no infant friendly toys. I will stick with Jump for Joy down the street.

Review: We typically love coming here so much so that we have a membership. However, the last few times we have gone, there have been multiple sick children, which in return have caused my child to get sick. The kids are coughing up a lung and are allowed to just run around. The last time we were in there was a very apparently sick child she was coughing such a deep mucas sounding cough, and one of the employees knew them and didn't say anything, she knew not only the kid by name bht the parents as well. This makes me really not want to bring my child in anymore because we are always seeing the sick kids being allowed to be in there and playing. I guess since covid isn't as big of a deal anymore, the post covid rules for coming in sick don't apply anymore. It's very disappointing.

Review: ""If it wasn't for the kids""
This is an entire racket. Overpriced and no bathrooms inside. If you're there with multiple kids while your wife shops you're expected to put everyone's shoes back on, and tote them to the bathroom located in the outer mall.  They don't offer much more than the city park. 2 stars because the staff were friendly and attentive.

Review: At first I was excited to see kids under 1 year old are free, and I totally understand the need to pay for special socks. However why is there a charge for a 2nd adult (who will just be standing there watching my baby play)? I just feel like that's quite unnecessary. I didn't end up going here after all because I just don't feel it's right to only let one parent come in for free.

Review: I have taken my two toddlers here several times, and have always been pretty satisfied. My suggestion would be to call ahead of time in case there's too many birthday parties going on at the same time, otherwise there might be a short wait time. The only downside is that you'll need to buy their socks for a few bucks

Review: Didn't get her name but a staff member was incredibly rude to a friend and I on multiple occasions. Not entirely sure what she had against us or if she was just having a really bad day. Gave off the ""I hate everything and everyone vibe.""

We stayed for about 30mins, the rude employee made us feel unwelcomed and targeted so we opted to leave. Unfortunately, souring the experience so it wasn't worth the cost for us which is really too bad. Didn't even get to fully explore the area.

Seems like it's great for 2 and older kids. Fun idea for a birthday parties, and a great option during the winter months. Love the concept, just not the one staff member.

Review: Overall we had a positive experience letting our kids play at Junebug, but a few things I noticed that seemed different than what I expected. Other than a giant ballpit, there were no other play structures or spaces that seemed to be designed for more active play. There were so many wonderful spaces for imaginative and creative play, which my daughter loved. But I know my son was looking for more opportunities to get his energy out.
They have a small more baby friendly corner, but it is not closed off from the rest of the play space. And the rest of the space has several non-baby friendly toys that present choking hazards.
The creative play spaces are all closed off in mini cubicles. So if you have multiple children, it is impossible to keep eyes on all of them at once, making the small toys an extra choking concern.
If you have older toddlers or young kiddos, this space would be great for you! (The kiddo potty and sink in the restroom were a big hit with our toddlers!)
But I wouldn’t recommend it for mamas with babies or younger toddlers who still put small items in their mouths. And it’s not ideal when looking for a place to let your kids run and play to get their energy out.

Review: Junebug is a wonderful indoor play space on rainy or sunny days. The space is clean and inviting! Many different play areas to keep the little ones busy and engaged. I am extremely impressed with the simple idea of having a high chair in the restroom for infants/toddlers so caretakers can use the restroom without fear of the little ones touching the restroom floor. Delaney is a wonderful asset to Junebug with an inviting smile and helpful attitude!!  Thank you Delaney for assisting in us having a wonderful experience. I wish I lived closer to the area so my family and I could come more often.

It was so nice to let the kids run around and play while the staff tidy up allowing parents to relax. I was impressed with the attention to detail. They’ve thought of everything. Even the restrooms have a miniature toilet, sink, feminine products, and hair ties! The nursing room was so relaxing and had a changing table with diapers of all sizes. There is an infant section and a section with desks and craft supplies for older kids.  They also have cute apparel and a little shop area in the front. We will definitely be back! So happy we have a play place in Ridgefield!

I could tell they put a lot of thought, planning and time into putting together their vision and bringing it to life. There was plenty for my kids to do and the space feels spacious for people to spread out and play. You can bring your own snacks and food which is awesome. We will definitely be back! 2 hours was plenty of time for my kids to play and enjoy their time. They even give stickers to your kids on the way out as they leave to make saying goodbye a little easier.

Playground equipment, kitchen toy, kids tables, book & carpet area, big blocks and 2 bouncy houses. Table and chairs along the wall for easy supervision.
No food or beverage allowed in the playroom.

You can rent a room in front of the playroom for a birthday party etc. $50/h, minimum 2 hours. The playroom remains open to everybody even if you rent the room for a party.

My wish is that they open during hours I can take my son during the week. I believe they close at 11am or 12pm during the week and I'm at work during that time. That said, my son can only enjoy the benefits of Sounders on the weekends. No place can be perfect but Sounders is pretty close. Add a grill and soft drinks and we'd never leave, lol.

Review: The food was a huge pleasant surprise. Absolutely amazing menu and quality for a bowling alley. Probably the best place to eat on base.

Cosmic bowling needed music and less white light, but we still had fun. Equipment was in good shape and plenty of small kid size shoes and balls.

Prices were good, especially with the summer kids bowl free program.

Thanks guys!

Review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We had such a fantastic time at Wild Child inside Valley View Mall in La Crosse! This indoor playground is an absolute gem for families with little ones. There’s such a wide variety of toys and play structures that kept our almost 23 month old boy happily entertained the entire visit. From imaginative play to climbing and crawling, there’s truly something for every age and interest.

One feature we especially loved was the separate, sectioned-off area for children 2 and under. While younger kiddos can absolutely enjoy the entire play area, it’s really thoughtful and comforting to have a space just for them to explore more safely and at their own pace.

Everything was very clean, well-maintained, and clearly cared for—which makes a big difference in a space like this! The snack and drink vending machine was also a much-appreciated bonus for parents and kiddos who need a quick break and refreshment without having to leave the space.

Highly recommend Wild Child to anyone with young kids looking for indoor fun in La Crosse! We’ll definitely be back.

Review: Wildchild Indoor Playground is an absolute blast for kids of all ages! From the moment we walked in, the vibrant colors and exciting energy were contagious. My children, ages 3 and 7, were immediately captivated by the variety of play structures. The multi-level climbing area kept my older one engaged, while the dedicated toddler zone provided a safe and stimulating environment for my youngest.
What truly impressed me was the cleanliness and the attentive staff. The entire facility was spotless, and the staff members were friendly, helpful, and clearly focused on ensuring everyone's safety and enjoyment. It's such a relief to find a place where kids can burn off energy in a secure and well-maintained setting.
Wildchild offers more than just climbing and sliding; the interactive games and obstacle courses added an extra layer of fun and challenge. It's the perfect spot for a rainy day adventure or just a fun outing to get the wiggles out. We left with two happy, tired kids and can't wait to visit Wildchild again soon! Highly recommend!! Live your best life!

Review: It's fun for kids, however I wish they restricted by age, not height. My son is only 5 and he's in the 97% for height so he is right at the top of the ruler for measuring. Seems a little unfair, especially since his cousin is 7 and very very short and is no where near the top of the measurement ruler.

Review: Compact FREE indoor playground for toddlers to Kindergarten children. Just need to scan ID at the front. No age limit although parent supervision is required all the time.

Playground equipment, kitchen toy, kids tables, book & carpet area, big blocks and 2 bouncy houses. Table and chairs along the wall for easy supervision.
No food or beverage allowed in the playroom.

You can rent a room in front of the playroom for a birthday party etc. $50/h, minimum 2 hours. The playroom remains open to everybody even if you rent the room for a party.

At 2024 Jan bowling alley is not in operation.

I feel bad for her having to put up with some of the entitled parents who come here though. It's free with a military ID but I've heard people complaining about the fact that food isn't supposed to be brought in (because allergies are a thing!!) And last time I was there someone was complaining that she wasn't watching the kids. That's not her job!!! Parents are supposed to be watching their kids. I mean honestly!!

Review: Sounders is an amazing place for children. Especially, in a state that is cold and rainy a few months out of the year. My son absolutely loves Sounders.
My wish is that they open during hours I can take my son during the week. I believe they close at 11am or 12pm during the week and I'm at work during that time. That said, my son can only enjoy the benefits of Sounders on the weekends. No place can be perfect but Sounders is pretty close. Add a grill and soft drinks and we'd never leave, lol.

Review: It's fun for kids, however I wish they restricted by age, not height. My son is only 5 and he's in the 97% for height so he is right at the top of the ruler for measuring. Seems a little unfair, especially since his cousin is 7 and very very short and is no where near the top of the measurement ruler.

Place was warm and dry. Which you would expect from an indoor play area. But that's the draw. Let the kids play and stay dry which is not easy here in Washington State. My boys had fun. Even had giant Legos for the kids to play with.

Review: Compact FREE indoor playground for toddlers to Kindergarten children. Just need to scan ID at the front. No age limit although parent supervision is required all the time.

Playground equipment, kitchen toy, kids tables, book & carpet area, big blocks and 2 bouncy houses. Table and chairs along the wall for easy supervision.
No food or beverage allowed in the playroom.

You can rent a room in front of the playroom for a birthday party etc. $50/h, minimum 2 hours. The playroom remains open to everybody even if you rent the room for a party.

At 2024 Jan bowling alley is not in operation.

Review: I love bringing my kiddos here. Safe, enclosed environment with wide variety of toys and several inflatables. The lady who works there is so nice and keeps the place very clean and tidy. I feel bad for her having to put up with some of the entitled parents who come here though. It's free with a military ID but I've heard people complaining about the fact that food isn't supposed to be brought in (because allergies are a thing!!) And last time I was there someone was complaining that she wasn't watching the kids. That's not her job!!! Parents are supposed to be watching their kids. I mean honestly!!

Review: Sounders is an amazing place for children. Especially, in a state that is cold and rainy a few months out of the year. My son absolutely loves Sounders.
My wish is that they open during hours I can take my son during the week. I believe they close at 11am or 12pm during the week and I'm at work during that time. That said, my son can only enjoy the benefits of Sounders on the weekends. No place can be perfect but Sounders is pretty close. Add a grill and soft drinks and we'd never leave, lol.

Cosmic bowling needed music and less white light, but we still had fun. Equipment was in good shape and plenty of small kid size shoes and balls.

Prices were good, especially with the summer kids bowl free program.

Thanks guys!

Review: My son absolutely loves Ahoy Kitsap Playland, and it's become one of our favorite go-to spots in Kitsap! We visit often, and every time, he has a blast — especially with the slides. The whole place is incredibly kid-friendly and safe, which gives me peace of mind as a parent.
The atmosphere is bright, clean, and welcoming. It's clear the staff cares about maintaining a fun and safe environment. One of the best things is that parents can actually sit back and relax while the kids play. There’s plenty of comfortable seating, good visibility of the play areas, and free Wi-Fi — a rare and much-appreciated combination for any indoor play space.
Ahoy Kitsap Playland strikes a great balance between active fun for kids and a laid-back vibe for parents. I highly recommend it to any families looking for a safe, fun, and clean place to let their little ones burn off some energy!

Review: My kids and I genuinely love this place. My kids play non-stop and it gives me an opportunity to sit back, relax, and watch them safely play from a nearby table. There is an area for smaller children that has open ended toy play, as well as the main playground. It’s clean and the staff are very friendly. The only downside is that you can’t bring in your own food/snacks. My kids have fallen in love with the snack bar, which is extensive. They also have hot and cold food options, a coffee menu, milk shakes, ice cream, drinks for kids and adults, etc. I have nothing had to say about this place. We come back and back, over and over again, especially on not so nice days. We drive over from Gig Harbor.

Review: I would have given a better rating if they were more accommodating to kids with severe food allergies. My son cannot eat a single snack option they sell inside but they refuse to allow ANY outside snacks even for babies/toddlers who they do not offer safe food options for. This is severely disappointing considering they sell a TON of food and drinks inside so it’s not about not allowing any food or drinks you just cannot bring your own even with anaphylactic allergies even though they don’t sell fully allergy safe snacks. Seems like discrimination to me.

Not sure if I will be back considering this limitation. For the price of $16 a kid you want to stay more than an hour to get your money worth but can’t bring safe snacks for your kids.

Review: Place is clean and nice. Smaller children's playground is easily good for children 8mo+. The larger playground for children 3yr+ is great as well. Kids easily run around for 2-3hrs.

Snacks are decent, mostly sugar treats and not terribly prices. They now ""serve"" alcohol buts it's not worth buying. It's easily not only marked up 5-7x the price (so $7 for a rainer beer) but it's also their ""policy"" that you have to buy a snack with any alcohol purchase so now it's even more expensive. What a joke lmaoo. If they lowered their beer to $5 and no stupid snack they'd actually sell some.

Review: Hard to find b/c the sign is fairly small on the highway; turn in to the United Rentals road and then go up the hill. Lots of parking. The indoor play area is huge (think of several McDonald’s indoor gyms put together). They have two small birthday rooms with tables and chairs and a sink (up a staircase) but not accessible as far as I could tell. I’m not sure if there is an elevator to get up there or not so folks should ask about that if needed. The kids had a wonderful time though…the family brought food and gifts and the kids played for hours!

Review: Fun place. A lot of climbing, jumping, sliding and places to hide BUT kids always ended up with severe lower GI issues. I ended up with Covid over Christmas after seeing Santa. Do not think it's food related as most items are prepackaged. Other grandmas have agreed about illnesses after visiting when we are arranging play dates.  Need better and more effective cleaning practices I'm guessing.

Review: This place is a nice alternative to the park when it’s rainy/cold, but there’s really not a whole lot for little ones and the area dedicated to them doesn’t have a very secure door, toddlers can just push it open and escape into the bigger area. They also changed the rules so you can’t bring in your own food, which I kind of understand for allergy reasons. The virtual reality area is pretty cool but I’m not sure if the price overall is really worth it to go all the time. I spent a good amount of time trying to keep my busy toddler inside the toddler area and then chasing him around to make sure he doesn’t get hurt by the bigger kids, so we both got some cardio in at least!

Room was small, hot (even with a portable ac that hardly worked), and smelled like wet dog and chemicals. Decorations wouldn’t stick to the walls and kept falling down. They gave us a mop to hold up the piñata by hand on the end of the stick handle. Play area looked packed beyond capacity. Standing room only, parents looked miserable. We were rushed in and out. Bathroom was filthy. Owner was rude and condescending. Spent over $400

Review: Fun and safe place to take the little ones. Is a well-disguised and entertaining prison, (one child-accessible exit) which means that us parents can mostly relax despite not being able to see them at ALL times in the large play area.
Went to a birthday party here which was reasonably priced with a private room.
Would go here again.
They get 4 stars here when it really should be five because they require you to purchase a food item with an adult beverage even after spending at least a few hundred dollars on a party that includes food purchased from the venue.

As an African American women I felt as though they was racist and made feel like my family and I was not welcomed. The bathrooms stink and it is sticky. If you have to leave your shoes in the front why the floors so sticky? The slides and tower is dirty, There is kids sliding down with the cars and the workers do nothing about it. I even complained about older kids trampling me and my child over!!!! They do nothing!!!! The food is nasty. I even saw a worker she had purple hair  dig in her nose and continued to make food. This is the worst establishment. Kitsap ahoy you will never get my money again $!!!!!!!!

One of our kids was pushed down a slide, we reported it (as the sign posted says to do) and the lady just walked over and told my husband that the kid wasn’t doing anything that very moment so they did nothing, then why is there a sign to report it? I don’t understand why there a multiple signs posted with rules but yet not one is enforced.

Review: Avoid this place and if you do go DO NOT buy a membership or use a card, only use cash. It’s small and extremely overpriced. Membership is expensive and if you decide you don’t want it anymore they require a months notice and if you are even 24 hours past what they consider the month mark they will refuse your request to cancel and charge your card anyway. Even if you’ve moved and will no longer be using their establishment, which I did make clear to them. They will charge your card without your permission even after removing your card from their system they keep it and use it anyways. It’s absolutely disgusting how administration treats people. They also do not enforce rules and safety. Older kids often trample through the toddler area and at times hurt smaller children. They also run up the slides causing crashes and safety issues. One of the times we were there a child fell through a broken area in the upper level and my husband and I had to climb the big slide and push her up to get her to safety as she was just hanging half way through stuck and her mom couldn’t reach her. And lastly they do allow sick children in which creates an unsafe medical environment as well. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: Relatively new place with a decent size playground going overhead and all across the area inside the building. They also have some arcade games but fairly limited on that. They have some packaged snacks at the front and they are ok with you bringing your own food. There is a Starbucks next door. Beware that they don’t allow re-entry even with an intact wrist band. Otherwise it is a fun, clean and safe place for kids to play.

Review: Came here for the first time and my daughter got her foot stuck through one of the nets, it took a while to get her foot out. If you have little one’s be adviced that the holes on the net are quite big. My friend bought 7 waters and the young lady working in the front had an attitude about it. My friend obviously paid for it but definitely felt like the lady didn’t want to sell her waters. On the other hand the guy working there was very nice and helpful. Overall great experience, young lady there needs better customer service.

Review: Lack luster at best. Our son got to go here today with a family friend. He is 8 and was very disappointed.  He said the play place is very small and the arcade is not included in the cost of the admission, which led him to feel bad because the play place was only entertaining for about 15 minutes.  Admission was $15! He also had a bad interaction with another child who was bullying. All around not worth it. Definitely will not be returning.

Review: We went there on the weekend and the party room door was open and the door leading to outside was left open. My 2 year old bolted and I ran after him but he is fast and actually got outside the door and fell and got wet from the rain on the ground and cried.. I shut the door leading to the party room after that. But the place was clean and it's nice to have something new for kids to burn off energy at the beach.

Our son who is 11 had the best time playing there and we have already booked a party.  The owners also have Game over Arcade across the road which is another good option for kids and everyone.

Review: Great location, right before Sumas border. Good stop for a restroom and a coffee, or a quick (but not necessary ) bite. A very good indoor playground for younger kids, to stretch their legs.

Well, in our case our small ordering of coffee and a shake were ""in progress"" for more than 10 minutes, since they were serving the drive through first. The guy that waited with me to be served, asked for the money back, dir to a long wait . After I alerted the crew about the long wait, my order was served within a minute. If you want things to be really quick: stop for the restrooms and than drive through for food.

When this place 1st opened it was during the covid 19 pandemic an it gave our youngest daughter an outlet to get her energy, an excitement out. Our youngest cj, absolutely loves wild flower, she calls it ""the play place"" an would spend every waking moment here if she could. Overall wild flower has given parents like myself an my wife a safe, secure, private place to take our children to an be able to watch, an let our children learn, an have a amazing time an not have a worry!! One year during the heat wave we had, we were able to take cj to the ""play place"" an she was able to play with other kids during the hear wave in a cool an safe atmosphere. Overall the board an the people who have worked tirelessly to keep, an maintain Wildflower are amazing an I  want to say THANK YOU!! SOOO! MUCH!! YOU GUYS!! ROCK!! themembership, an key fob males it a safe an secure establishment, an the chores/cleaning we as parents volunteer to do help keep wild flower clean an fantastic. I whole heartdly an with deep concern hope that wild flower remains open for many decades to come!!

The owners are super friendly and welcoming, and their kids (who are often around) are just as sweet my son loves playing with them. The space is always really clean, which I appreciate as a parent.

Review: New to Puyallup! I’ve been looking for indoor spaces to take my toddler. I found this place via Instagram! Our experience was just ok. I felt as if everything at that place I have at home already. It wasn’t busy but we came in the afternoon on a Thursday.

The pros:
• Super Clean and Tidy
• Nice selection of toys
• Owner is friendly
• One time waver upon registration
• Nice activity for a rainy day
• Great for smaller aged children

The Cons:
• There were renovations actively happening during visit. Ladders, tools, etc.,
• Back office door remained open.
• Loose bolts on some of the equipment. (Saw some children walking around with bolts. Were taken away.)
• No clearly marked area to nurse as an option.
• No music

I truly felt welcomed and this place is pretty new so I’m sure there will be more additions and improvements a year from now. Those are just my initial observations.

Review: Very cool place with a lot of neat toys, staff told me this was the third week they’ve been open. It’s very clean and the price is good. I personally think the themed rooms need a bit more work on the toys they offer. Like the car room has this neat Mario electric race track, but doesn’t quite work right all the time. My kiddo got bored of it pretty quick but still went back to it. It’d be nice to have more open ended toys. Maybe some small wooden blocks to build with and the wooden classic train tracks in the car room. It’d be nice to see some picture labels on walls and buckets where the toys are supposed to go to encourage clean up skills.

But that’s my opinion, overall I like the different rooms. There’s a lot to do to keep kids occupied. I will come back again

Review: If I could give more stars I would. It was a unique experience, and there is truly something for everyone. The price was extremely affordable, especially considering there is no time limit imposed. The kids can just go back and play until they're done, and there is plenty to do. We played Legos, arcade, puzzles, race cars, Barbies, and even Power Wheels. The owner was super friendly and accommodating, and it was just an overall lovely experience. So glad we decided to pop in, and we will be coming back!

Review: I love how close this place is for kids without needing to go the mall or downtown Puyallup!
Reasonablely priced at $13.50 w/card or $13 cash for 2 hours of playtime your baby/toddler/young child can play in their themed rooms. Great place for the kiddos to socialize and explore. You can bring your own snacks or pay for what they have there, the place looks and is consistently kept clean. The playspace after you check in is a no-shoes zone, so socks are a must. Will absolutely come back with my little ones, they had a great time

Review: We brought our 2 girls here earlier today, and they had a great time! There were different activities that they could do, ranging from a kids kitchen area, a princess room, a dinosaur area and more! They had some electric toys that they could ride around on, and when the batteries died they inflated a bouncy house. Just a great time for the kids. We were thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness as well. One room would be empty, and the staff would be right behind sanitizing every toy and touchable surface. I could not recommend this place more. Please support small business, this place rocks!

The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: This place is not Disneyland. It’s about $12 for an all day pass, and the equipment is weathered, HOWEVER this is an AMAZING place to bring a little kid. The bathrooms are clean and part of the reason for the weathered look is the staff is committed to keeping the surfaces sanitary. I’ve brought my 5 year old here since he was 2, and soon he’ll probably outgrow it, but the entire point is either my wife or I can stay here while he burns off his energy and the other can shop at the mall in peace.

Review: This place is D I R T Y. The pictures looked cute so we took our 2 year old and 10 month old. The concept was there but this place heavily misses the mark. The structures are falling apart, corners fraying, toys are broken and it’s so dirty. I’m not sure if it’s mold on the ceiling or just dark dust, but this place needs some serious upkeep. After we took our kids here, our 10 month old got very sick, throwing up for days. They have a ton of signage everywhere threatening fines for children disobeying rules, but when we were there, a birthday party was going on and the family had multiple older children the bulldozed my 2 year old off of the spinning balls and were absolutely destructive, with no repercussions. This place needs HELP. Avoid at all costs until some much needed TLC is invested 🤢

Review: My daughter is 3 now, we have been bringing her to WW since she was about 9 months old. It is still her #1 place to ask to go. I like that it is simple, closed in space, and has play structures that provide different levels of challenges (i.e. my daughter worked up to going down the baby slide, and then eventually graduated to the big slide.) Your experience here will depend heavily on 1. Time of day and 2. Which staff are working 3. How busy it is.  If you want to book a party I'd recommend an after hours one so your party goers are the only ones there unless it is going to be a small party.
I have to agree with the other reviews that say that it is kind of getting to that point where they are going to need to temporarily shut down and revamp. At first glance it looks pretty clean but like the other say if you look closely, the tape is wearing off and foam tiles are coming apart, etc. But gotta say of all the play places, it is the lowest stimulus and I feel safe letting my 3 year old run about without having to be right on top of her.

Review: We were there 20-30 mins max today. The male working at the front was friendly and pleasant. There were many people there with kids of all ages.
We are a AFRO LATINO family and noticed quickly that we were not very welcome
By some of the other customers. There a family that was (CLEARLY Middle eastern because of headdresses) . It was a  husband , wife and infant (10-15 month) old baby.

This family constantly rolled eyes, stared our
Kids down with the “evil eye look” and made angry faces towards us simply by coming in,

We have an 8yr old , 6 yr old 2 yr old and 1 year old. Our 2 year old happened to be walking backwards in the play area and their baby happened to be crawling directly
Behind her , the middle Eastern mother rolled her eyes and stared my two year old down simply because she took two steps backwards in front of her baby.

My two year old had no idea that the infant was behind her. She didn’t fall on him
Or Anything, i was able to call her towards me to prevent any incidents.

Point is: wiggleworks should create a sign or billboard that states that this is an inclusive environment that accepts all families regardless of race, gender or etc…. This is america. Kids play with kids from all backgrounds. We don’t roll eyes and stare other peoples children down.. that can cause arguments and fights…they are clearly racist and everything else.

We never said anything to the staff. Again yes they were some sort of middle Eastern but still, This is America , even if my daughter would’ve walked into the baby , generally we dust them off and get them back to playing…

The power went out and that was our cue to leave….the power shut back on maybe 15 mins later but i wouldn’t return until i see something noted that shows they support all people…
These folks made us feel so uncomfortable… 39 dollars wasted. My kids loveeeddddd the establishment but how can you enjoy it if adults are being ignorant and mean simply because you’re there. My kids just wanted to have fun. They weren’t running or being loud. They walked to each piece of equipment because they were mindful of the smaller kids there.

Please wiggleworks , post a sign stating that you’re inclusive and welcoming to all because clearly not all customers understand that . I was so close
To addressing that family but i chose not too because id rather post this.

Review: Play area is great for small children.  Upkeep is to minimum, but I believe that is due to business model and staffing.  The lady staff member on duty seemed to not prioritize opening on time or getting assistance as she had lost her debit card and left the front desk during her shift.  During this time customers came and some left after waiting 10+ min and others came in and dealt with the payment details when she came back ~20min later.  Come care could be put into supporting the staff members here, which of course potentially elevates the business.

Dirt accumulated on most of the infant toys and structures. Stuff broken. Like zippers that keep the structures covered with foam. This will be the last time we come. Gave an extra star for the sweet girl working. She is so kind and good with the kiddos. She was doing her best to vacuum, pick up, etc but this needs a shut down-no guests level clean.

Review: Place is disgusting, duct tape holding everything together including light switches and outlets. We had our kids birthday party there and at 285 for 1.5 hours not worth it. One of my kids popped a balloon and a staff member told everyone in there that ""if your kid pops a balloon we'll charge you for it"". Then when our 1.5 hours was up in the party room same person came and stayed rushing us out. We stayed for another 45 minutes to let the kids play and no one went into the room at all. Took staff almost an hour to get us the balloons we paid for. Not well kept facility, rude staff, expensive, and only 2 bathrooms.

Review: My 16 month old loves this place! We usually go on Thursday afternoons and it’s never busy and the price is fair. He just plays and plays and gets interaction with kids around his age as most of the kids I’ve seen there are toddlers. They have a good array of toys and I feel like every time I’ve been, there has a been a new toy that my son loves to play with. I will continue to visit here to burn off some of my sons endless energy.

While we were outside packing our car the lady that works until closing on Sunday pulled up & threatened us stating “we don’t know who she knows” with a man about how we felt about her service. Her service was terrible & she should lose her job. The most unprofessional mess I’ve ever witnessed! And then to threaten a party after we paid is ridiculous.

Review: My toddler actually gets the most out of this place. We tried taking her to the children's museum in Olympia, and it didn't work out for us. We spent all that $$$ (more than $40 for 3 admissions), but we didn't really get to use all of the places in the museum because my toddler is way too young to understand what's going on to even apply her skills to those areas. The children's museum is a great place for a kid who wants to learn. My toddler just wants to jump around and be crazy.

I actually wanted to go to South Hill Mall for shopping, but my toddler led me to this place because she saw slides and balloons. All you have to do is to sign up for your phone to be registered with the place, which the internet at South Hill Mall sucks for my T-Mobile, so the attendant had to register it for me. Anyway, she advised me the registration would be valid for 3 years from today. It's basically $12 including tax on the weekends per kid, and you can stay there as long as you'd like. It isn't charged hourly.

My toddler has a blast at this place. She loves the area with the fan blowing the balloons around and the bouncy/ slide area. Lol ! I am definitely coming back here for my toddler to exert her crazy energy out!

Review: I took my 3 grandkids(6,4&3) to wiggleworks due to Jumping Zone being closed for sanitizing. I think there were several other kids that were here for the same reason. The only negative was  WiggleWorks being quite a bit smaller of an area than Jumping Zone. I was pleasantly surprised with the friendly service I got from the attendant , the entire area appeared clean & sanitary(included the restroom) & there was  sufficient climbing items/areas to keep the kids entertained for several hours. I felt the price for admission was also fair

They dont clean or wipe down anything, they had tape around things instead or replacing them. Blocks were sticky and the fans had alot of dust in them.

Review: If You’re Planning a Party Here, Read This First”

I had visited this place before for a playdate and had a good experience, so I decided to book my daughter’s birthday party here. The space itself is nice — there’s a big area for kids, a smaller section for toddlers, and the bathrooms were clean and modern.

But if you’re thinking of booking a party here, there are several things you should really be aware of — and some things the business seriously needs to improve.

1. Check-in/Check-out Process:
Their system is slow and outdated. They use a highlighter pen to write random letters on each person’s wrist when they arrive, then check the mark under a UV light when people leave. On a busy day, this creates a huge backup at the front, with long lines of people trying to get in and out. Some kids in my party didn’t even get their wrist marked properly, so the staff didn’t know who their parents were at pickup — I had to step in and confirm identities. It’s stressful, disorganized, and needs to be replaced with something more efficient.

2. No Help During the Party:
If you book a party, you’re basically on your own. I had over 20 kids, and they only gave me two small tables that barely seated 10. I asked for an extra table — no one brought it, so I ended up grabbing one myself from another room. There’s no assigned staff to help or check in on you. Anything you need (a lighter, garbage bags, etc.), you have to go downstairs and ask for it yourself — which takes up even more of your short 2-hour time slot.

3. No Party Announcements (This Was a Big Issue):
One of the most frustrating things was that they have no microphone or PA system to make announcements. You know how most places say things like, “Hey kids, come back to Mariana’s party table for cake!”? That doesn’t exist here. I had to physically search the whole (very large) play area to find all the kids in our group when it was time for food and cake. I even brought colored necklaces to identify the kids, and it still didn’t help much. When I asked staff if they could make an announcement, they said, “Oh, we don’t do that.” With only two hours for the entire party, I easily lost 20–30 minutes just trying to round everyone up. It was a mess. This is something they really need to fix — it’s a basic necessity for running organized parties.

4. Time Pressure and Rushed Cleanup:
Parties are booked back-to-back, so you have to be completely out by your end time — not just cleaning up, but out of the party room. At 4:15 sharp, I was still trying to clean up and get kids out, but the next group was already arriving. It felt rushed and chaotic, and staff didn’t offer any help.

Final Thoughts:
The place itself has potential. It’s clean, the space is fun, and the kids had a good time. But the lack of organization, no announcements, no support, and outdated check-in system made the experience way more stressful than it needed to be. If you’re booking here, come prepared with your own helpers and make sure to confirm every detail ahead of time.

I’m not writing this to bash the place — just sharing my honest experience so other parents know what to expect, and hopefully so the team can make improvements. A few small changes could make a big difference.

Review: Really nice indoor playground for kids at an affordable price! I love that they have a separate area just for younger toddlers. The main play area for older kids is fun and offers a great variety of activities.

I also noticed the staff actively cleaning surfaces throughout our visit, which gave me peace of mind. Not something you see at every playplace. The whole space felt clean, safe, and welcoming.

There’s plenty of seating for parents and good visibility to keep an eye on your kids. Overall, it’s a great place for little ones to burn off energy indoors.

One small suggestion I have is to play more child-friendly music throughout the space. It could help create a more fun and engaging atmosphere for the kids, making the environment feel even more cohesive and lively.

Review: It’s a great indoor playground—spacious and currently very clean, likely because it’s still new. However, if parents are allowed to wear their shoes everywhere inside, it may not stay that way for long. Rules are rules—why not enforce a shoe-free policy from the start? The staff mopped the floor, but with outdoor shoes stepping all over while it’s still wet, it feels pretty gross.

Review: My son's daycare went while school was closed, went to pick him up at the center vs waiting at his daycare facility (got off work early) and the workers were completely rude and not helpful at all, I simply asked if I could walk in to retrieve my son and the answer was no, okay they are in green tshirts can you let me know if they are still here.. no. Can you please just have a look if they are here before I drive back ... no.
Just no help whatsoever and could care less about my inquiries, not impressed at all.

Review: I visited Play Abby Langley for the first time on February 22, 2025, with my four kids. We arrived at 9:30 AM to avoid peak hours.

Overall, it's a great place for kids. In the morning, it was clean and well-maintained. However, by noon, it got significantly busier. There was a mix of people—some who had been there since the morning without shoes (as required), and new arrivals in the afternoon still wearing shoes. This led to a lot of mess.

The washrooms didn’t have garbage cans near the toilets, so unfortunately, some parents started leaving dirty diapers around. The staff worked hard, constantly cleaning both the playground floor and equipment, but they struggled to keep up with the growing crowd.

By 2 PM, the place was packed. I saw a child bleeding, parents arguing with staff, and long lineups both to enter and exit. It felt chaotic.

In the end, Play Abby Langley is like many other indoor playgrounds. Since it's new, it looks nice, but the experience can change drastically depending on the crowd.

Review: Was super excited to have a Play Abby in Langley I booked my daughters party there. I paid for the whole place for 2 hrs to be told I won't get to use the whole place. I asked before hand about decorating and set up as I see they had 3 tiny little ""rooms"" downstairs for parties. I asked about upstairs, to just be told ""Oh it's much easier if you do it downstairs so you don't have to do go up and down the stairs."" Come party day I was told I don't get the whole venue. I asked why couldnt i use upstairs and all they would tell me is ""its not part of your package."" When i literally paid for thr whole venue. I had almost 40 kids plus parents. It only made sense to set up upstairs with decorations and food but nope. They gave me 2 tiny tables that would've have barely fit 10 kids. Then I had to put my food in one of the tiny rooms downstairs, presents tossed into the other and told them to give me enough tables to fit all the kids. The tables were set up right in front of the slides making it all cramped. Basically no flat walls to put up decorations. I was not happy. Paid over $500 for the whole venue but I didn't get to use the whole venue. False advertisement!

Review: We came here to play, however they surround the entire play area with pay rides and TV screens so instead of getting physical activity, my kids just wanted to sit and watch video game previews.

If they want to make an extra $1 or 2 off parents they should just charge more for admission instead of luring children to their rides.

Review: Came here today for the first time and my daughter (19 months) had a amazing time!
The young child area, I believe, is better then the original Play Abby location as there is more things to do for crawling children while still having areas for those who need more challenge but aren't ready for the big area.
Everything was very clean, and when speaking to others who have been here before found this was to be expected which I love. I don't think I ever looked around and didn't see staff cleaning something.
For the entry fee this place is well worth it.
However there are two criticism I have to put out that takes this place from a 5 stars to 4. The first is that all the unused outlets were uncovered. I 100% agree that children should be supervised here at all times however it only takes a second for tragedy to strike and a pack of outlet covers aren't unreasonably expensive. Open outlets should definitely be covered ASAP.
The second is one myself and other parents found very off putting. The music playing was not appropriate for children. I don't think any child playing here should here the words ""Superman that hoe"". Someone said they asked the staff if the music could be changed and were told ""This is the playlist we play"" which I am curious if management knows about. I'm not saying they should play only kids bop and baby shark (good gods please don't). However the music should be void of explicit words and adult subject matter if you're playing it in a childrens indoor playground. If management wants one curated for them feel free to let me know, id be happy to make them one thats child appropriate that won't make the adults want to do their own head in.
Overall this place is wonderful and if those two things are tended too ill gladly update my review to 5 stars later.

Review: Love the space, very clean and welcoming, however with my slightly larger group of 6 parents with 4 seats/ table that wasn't a b day party they wouldn't allow me to push 2 tables together to socialize with my parent group. So we had to be 5' apart and yell to communicate, yes kids are expected to be loud, This felt like social distancing all over again which was the opposite of the reason for coming. Accommodate for groups please.

The structure itself was majority ""parent friendly"" tall enough for us to climb and chase our little ones. They even offer a diaper and wipes if you forget one for your baby.

Gated entry with checks to ensure the right parent is leaving with their children helps with peace of mind with safety.  You can walk around the whole structure too so you can easily spot your kids while their climbing.

Inexpensive compared to other places.

Review: Went to try out the new Play Abby Langley after school yesterday. I was very impressed with the space, ambiance and vibes. I love play Abby Abbotsford and play Abby Langley definitely has some similarities but so fun differences too.
The structure was easy for me, even as an older, larger person to navigate with my kiddos.  It was not hard on my feet, back or knees as I got to stand up through most of the play area.
They have a little sports court that allowed for some fun play and was a favorite for my kids. The slides were smooth.
The bathrooms were very clean and the accessible bathroom was especially impressive. So I know that Grandma will be in good shape if she met us there.
My absolute favorite thing about play! Abby Langley and Abbotsford is that you can bring in your own food and drinks. This meant that we from end of school until closing + we were able to eat snacks + partial dinner there while they played.
They have separate play spaces for older kids and for  toddlers.
Overall, this will be our go-to spot for meeting with friends and family for playdates in this area. They have loyalty cards with discounted admissions which makes going even more affordable.
Looking forward to going back.

Review: As a toddler mom I highly recommend the new Langley Play Abby.

The first thing I noticed was that the staff was constantly cleaning which was nice to see.

The toddler area was beautifully done and large. But even in the bigger kid area I didn't find I had to help her too much which was nice. So many play places I spend the entire time lifting her or trying to avoid the sudden floor cut outs.

Prewarning the top level is very warm and you're not able to stand. Wear a thin shirt. I was iffy if I'd be able to get thru the rollers. Some areas were tight but I was able to squeeze thru and I'm not a tiny person haha

We got the loyalty card which is $63 but gets her age (1.5) 10 times or it's $9 if you want to pay per visit. Being a stay home Mom on a budget I really appreciate this as I can take her there pretty much 4 times for free.

Bathrooms are spotless with a change table. Most of not all the ride on toys took cards. Plus some toy and candy machines that took coins.

They sell snacks, ice cream, plushies and bottled drinks - I didn't purchase so don't know the price but love the options. Lots of high chairs.

We will be a regular for sure

Review: Absolutely love Project Play!!!!

This place is a gem for families with young kids. The water table is a massive hit - my kid was glued to it for nearly the entire time! It's such a well-thought-out space with just the right kind of calm, stimulating environment that keeps kids engaged and happy.

There’s a fantastic variety of activity stations to suit every child’s interests; whether it's pretend play, climbing, hanging, sliding, magnetic tiles, or of course, water play. It’s the kind of place where kids can explore freely and safely.

We also hosted a birthday party upstairs, and it couldn’t have gone better. The party area is spacious and perfectly set up, and the staff is incredibly accommodating. I like that the party area is separate from play area. A special shoutout to Jyoti, who assisted us throughout. She was not only helpful and kind but also very attentive around the children. She proactively kept wiping the water table area to minimize and actually eliminate any slipping hazards, making it a truly carefree and safe experience for both kids and parents.

We loved that there were no restrictions on food, piñatas, or confetti balloons - such a rare find! Best of all, there’s no cleanup stress after the party. Just grab all your belongings, and the wonderful team takes care of the rest.

Highly recommend Project Play to anyone looking for a creative, welcoming, and fun space for kids to play or celebrate a special day!

Review: We recently hosted my son's 2nd birthday there and had a great time. Although two hours went by fast, it was easy to manage with cake cutting/food/etc. I was in contact with Maria, who helped me understand the logistics of having a birthday there. A few things that could add value are whether the staff can serve the cake and help clean up. As the party hosts, it took us away from the party to have to clean up during the party ( within the two-hour window). All to say, I would recommend having a birthday there; communication from staff was great, the play area was a hit for young and older kids, and the separate room for food is a great bonus.

Review: This review has mixed feelings. I have read some of the other reviews and particularly one where the owner replies that $500/2hr party is within the norm of other business. While I agree with that, I don't agree with the service and the overall vibe of Project Play.

First and foremost, 30 minutes for someone to set up for a birthday party especially while also paying for a seperate decorator who also struggled with time is frustrating... I have never been so stressed out along with my wife when it came time for set up and clean up. The fact that we were also rushed out is beyond unacceptable. There needs to be way more in the sense of help and leniency.

We have thrown the last 3 birthday parties for my son at PlayAbby in Abbotsford and they provide simple decor, provide amazing help with set up and clean up. Our next birthday party will be at the PlayAbby location that is brand new in Langley. For those considering birthday parties for their children I would strongly consider looking there for the same cost as they allow you to host private events for the exact same price.

Review: We hosted our 3-year-old’s birthday party here, and it was fantastic. The time frame was perfect for play/family time. The separate upstairs area was great for a piñata play and cake cutting.

It feels like a mini version of Science World without the crowds. My 1.5-year-old loved the water and light tables, while my older child loved the slide. The space is thoughtfully designed for all ages.

The owners and staff are kind and accommodating. Project Play is such a gem in our community, and I highly recommend it for birthdays and fun outings.

Review: Great location and play centre. Good for variety of ages and less overwhelming than other kids play centres. There is a place for parents to sit which is nice. There was value with being able to book a time slot as it prevents over crowding for kids.

Review: First experience here was with my grand daughter and it was great! She enjoyed so much that I was going to purchase a gift card for her for Christmas. I drove out from Abbotsford on Saturday & was there at noon only to stand at the counter waiting. No staff, no bell to ring. As I stood waiting someone else arrived to check in and still nobody came.  So becoming frustrated and having other things to do with my day I left and purchased her a Rec center gift card. In the days of shop local, this was a missed opportunity. Disappointed

The slide was a bit intimidating for my toddler at first, but she enjoyed it after the first try! I just wish there was a bit more seating for parents. Overall, a good experience!

Review: We love this place!!

I find play centers to be overwhelming and kind of gross haha. This place is not that. I love that they only have 12 spots open at a time. I’ve actually made quite a few mom friends coming here. The space is clean and well maintained. It’s small enough that you can keep an eye on your kid without chasing them endlessly. You can bring snacks, have some coffee, and even relax?!  They play soft instrumental covers of pop songs which is such a cute touch. My absolute favorite part is the staff. They are so kind, welcoming and helpful. Always happy to hold my baby so I can go to the bathroom or help my son to a sticker to help transition him from playtime to the process of going home.

We got a pass during a holiday sale and it’s very much worth it.

Review: We had a great time hosting our son’s third birthday at Project Play! We paid for the extra time so we could clean up after the party vs during the party. We found 2 hours to be *plenty* of play time for the ages of the kids in our group. They were accommodating to let us setup early and we were cleaned up and out just before 6:30pm. Staff were helpful with music (though I’d recommend bringing your own sound system for upstairs). Space is beautiful, well maintained, and thoughtfully designed. We brought additional folding tables and definitely needed the space to accommodate our food and activities.

Puma was super easy to work with in advance of the party. Staff are there if you need something during the party, and otherwise very unobtrusive.

Review: I hosted a birthday party for my daughter at this facility. It is a really nice centre , clean and lots of interactive things for kids to do especially the water table - it was a hit! I was disappointed with how the business was managed. I picked a time slot (4-6) that was the last birthday of the day. Paid for the extra 30 minutes as 2 hours for set up/ clean up , play time and entertainment is quite limited. I also booked a princess character from 530-630pm which is til the very end of the party. I contacted the manager to express my concern with timing and if we could just have some extra time after 630pm to clear out the space and get people out. From the sounds of it the manager was okay with it as long as no one was using the downstairs play centre part after 630pm. Which no one was. As soon as it hit 630pm we were approached by staff to collect payment for overtime of $75. We were trying to pack up and get people out and then was approached with that …it was super off putting. I explained to the staff that I spoke to the manager on the phone the morning of the party and I explained it will take us time to clear out with the amount of stuff we had for the party but no one would actually be using the play centre downstairs after 630pm. Unfortunately how the business was managed was not very professional and seemed very much about money not the experience. The cost to rent the space for 2 hours is already highly priced. I would not host another birthday at this facility again or recommend it after the negative experience with the staff.

Review: Five out of five stars because my almost 3 yr old son loved it so much! At first glance it is a small space, but he easily spent over 2 hours here going from station to station. It’s different from the other indoor play centres that seem to be popping up all over the lower mainland because there is no food or beverage available, so pack a small snack for yourself and for your kids.

This place isn’t too colourful or loud, so it’s not overwhelming for anyone. And because it’s a small space it was quite easy to tend to my infant son while watching over my toddler. Great for moms who are adjusting to life with 2 kids.

The slide is steep and fast.
Parking is limited.
Price is fair.

I didn’t see much space to park a stroller.

Review: Pricey for birthday parties, around 500 for 2 hrs. The thing that prompted me to leave this review was the rudeness of the girl who answered the phone. Zero social skills and I felt like she was rushing to get off the phone. She sounded young and when I was in the middle of saying ""thank you very much, I'll talk to my wife about it..."" she hung up on me mid sentence! Rude.

Review: This place is very well- thought of. It’s clean, it’s safe. It’s not overwhelming: no loud music, or distracting lights. Kids can really focus on playing.

My toddler had so much fun. The water table is great: it has jigsaw puzzles, magnetic fish, plastic balls and detachable/ movable dividers. Smocks are available, but still bring a change of clothes.

The magnetic wall is good for working on their fine motor skills.

Their foam pit is perfect as I didn’t have to worry about corners. It has a small slide, sensory wall, peg board, and drop ball tower.

Their playground has a slide, trampoline and wall climbing area perfect for bigger kids.

There is a café for pretend play, complete with utensils.

They have a small area where kids and grownups can have their snacks.

There is something for everyone.

I think this is also a perfect party venue.

We will definitely come back.

Review: Project play activity center has been my go to place for me, my toddler, my sister and her kids. I haven't been too many kid café spots, but my sister has and she says this place has many things for toddlers and enough things for her kids who are a little older than my toddler. I really like how the activity center has a water station. I also appreciate how they have the toddler spot with the walls that seemed to have changed over time. I had to change my time/reservation because I got Covid, and when I emailed, their responses were prompt. I appreciated their quick responses and flexibility. We'll be back. My toddler loves this place. Just bring lots of change of clothes, snacks, water, and socks (for you and your kid).

Review: Activities: 4/5 Stars
The water table is a main attraction and really neat. Staff do a great job keeping the area mopped up to avoid slips.
The baby area is well padded. When we were there a wood piece fell off the busy board. I question the size of the pieces attached to it (choking hazards)
The slide is insane, very fast and steep.

Setting: 4/5
The small setting is nice, however you feel like you're in a library. If your kids are the remote bit on the louder side you'll definitely feel on display.

Price point: 1/5
I understand overheads and charging more for a smaller ratio of kids per play session. That being said their price point means project play is inaccessible to families with more than one child. $60-80 for two hours of play is not in large families spending interests.

The place has always been impeccable and the energy of it is unmatchable.
We happened to have our son’s birthday party here and we were blown away by how smooth and easy was to coordinate everything, the attitude was always “how can we help” .
They also offer great classes that we have been lucky enough to try and the kids couldn’t stop talking about them on the ride home.
Looking forward creating many memories ahead with this lovely place .

Our son was obsessed with the water table and loved playing the kitchen. My husband and I really liked the thought that went in to the height for the climbing structure... we didn't have to bend over as we climbed with our kiddo!

Review: Beautiful and clean play place. It definitely deserves 5 stars for the bigger kids so I'll give them that, but I will say I was slightly disappointed bringing my 11 months old (1 week from turning on). She LOVES water, but the water table was too high for her to even touch the water. There were only two stools, which the bigger kids were using to sit. We did manage to get one at one point, but then it was more me dangling her. I took her to the toddler area which was adorable and she had fun but I personally can't justify $20 for her to play with a busy board on the wall and a few foam blocks.

Would be nice to see a lower rate for the kids who can't use 90% of the center even if it's less time but that's my groups two cents. Sadly we won't be back for the reason for another year or so but we would love to use it when she's bigger.

Review: My son absolutely loves Bonkerz!
I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: We love this place! It’s always super clean, which is a huge win for a kids’ indoor play space. I really appreciate that they’re strict about keeping socks on—especially in the fall and winter when germs are everywhere. It always feels like a healthier, safer environment for little ones.

We recently took our 3-year-old to the Princess Ball, and it was such a magical experience! Meeting all the princesses was a dream come true for her. The event was so thoughtfully done—the snacks were great, the little details made it feel extra special, and best of all, it wasn’t overcrowded. That made a huge difference for our shy girl, who was able to enjoy everything at her own pace without being overwhelmed.

Highly recommend this place for both everyday play and their special events!

We live over an hour away and it was seriously worth the drive! We had a personal hostess who helped us plan the party, she met us early and helped with the decorating and coordinated everyone to make the set up go smoothly! It was great because the kids could play while all this was happening. They had a lot of the party things there already and it seemed like each time I mentioned something I had forgotten they had it! Once people started arriving the hostess greeted everyone and helped with drinks.  Everyone had a great time! And we had whole two hours not including set up to enjoy ourselves.  We have 4 kids and have done a lot of party rentals throughout Oregon and this one was worth every penny.

She helped me set up the food tables and helped unload/load the car. It was so nice to not have to worry about anything once the party was over.

There are many rooms with different themes and each room feels so intentional, clean, and beautiful. All of the children played easily, partially due to the fact that there was so much space to spread out. Many of the adults commented on how at ease they felt there. Employees there were very friendly, genuine, and helpful. We will be back!

Review: This is a great spot for babies and young toddlers. It’s not so great for kids 3-6. The capacity should be limited more because there aren’t enough toys or room for the amount of people allowed in at one time. We used to come when my son who is 4 was 2 and since then I haven’t seen any new toys. The snacks and drinks are kept at child level which I don’t love. Since adults are required to purchase snacks, then it would make more sense for them to be stored higher up where only adults can access them. They built an outdoor area which is nice but it is often closed.

The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean in my opinion. Perhaps changing the age range or providing more age appropriate toys for kids in the 3-6 range would help.

The play areas are clean and tidy- lots of things for the kiddos to do! They are very accommodating for our oldest who has special needs. Since everything there is based on imagination play and Montessori style there is nothing that is loud or overwhelming for kiddos with sensory issues. Tons of easy parking too!!!

Thank you Leka for another birthday celebration!!! See you all next time :)

Review: Definitely not returning.
Here’s my experience. We came with extra sandwiches in a bag for the kids to have in case they are hungry. We decided to ask our family friends to bring their kids and hang out with our daughter for an early birthday hangout. We were aware that the place does not allow birthday celebrations , balloons , cakes… etc, so we didn’t bring any of that.

As soon as i entered the place , the cranky lady immediately felt the need to say make sure this is not a celebration, we don’t allow it . No cakes, no balloons , no decorations.  Again, none of that was present.

As my daughter started playing, the cranky host decided to come right behind her and put away her toys and puzzles that she started building. We told her she’s still playing with them. She went to look for more puzzles . She ignores us and put the puzzles away and said “ they are here , she can play here” additionally, she took one of the boys car away as soon as he got up from the little car.  We were 8 adults and all felt uncomfortable about the attitude we received from the facility care taker. Kids could not enjoy their time because she would constantly take away the toys

Our favorite areas are the leather couch, the tables, the outdoor water play area, and the Montessori style kitchen. The dress-up closet is also adorable.

It’s kept meticulously clean and is by far our favorite amongst all the local indoor playgrounds. The only downside is they don’t allow kids over 5 years old at all, which may be hard on some families.

Review: My 14 month old enjoyed this place so much!  I'm planning on buying the 12 visit package for her so we can keep coming back.  This place has all their toys at the kid's level.  Great items in the baby room.  My daughter especially loved the play kitchen's doors and the water table.

Review: LEKA is a fantastic place to bring your young child. There is something for everyone, be it dress up, a play tent, a train set, or the big castle and slide. The outdoor area with water tables is also a huge hit and we appreciate the complimentary Crocs (for both kids and adults) to keep socks from getting soaked. Their special events are a huge hit and fill up fast, so make sure you are on the email list!

Review: Leka is the best of the best when it comes to fun outings with little kids. I have been coming for 2 years and never had a bad experience. My 2 year old and 4 year old both always have a great time and I do too! Love that there are plenty of tables for snacks and they even provide snacks for purchase (including ice cream in the summer.) The happy hour promo is amazing and I appreciate that we can go and come back. It’s never overly crowded and because it’s only younger kids, it always feels safe for my littles. Even the bathroom is well stocked for kids. I have tried pretty much every kid experience in town and this is the best one

Appropriate for infants and older kiddos with lots of different toy/play options. There is space to feed kiddos/clean bathrooms to change diapers. They even have a little snack area for parents with a Nespresso machine which is lovely. Very well executed, we plan on coming back often!

Review: This place was ok, I guess. The employees we interacted with were pleasant. No issue there. I personally didn't care for the separate rooms. I like an open room that I don't have to be up my child's shadow when it comes to an indoor play place. After that, the snack and drink area is open and accessible to the children. My kid wanted to open the drawers and I saw another getting into the little fridge they had. Beyond that, they have a room filled with beads (maybe dried chickpeas?). The room is segregated by a thick vinyl curtain like a car wash, but the beads still get out into the rest of the play area despite the best efforts of the staff to keep them in that area. So it ended up being a lot of following around looking out for hazards. I didn't have fun. The toys and structures were decent enough. I doubt I will be back to be honest. As a side note, I understand you can get alcohol everywhere 'round these parts but it seems odd to have it at a  child's play place. Especially when the children have access to the child size tables these drinks are placed on. Yeah. Definitely not coming back.

Review: Would definitely recommend LEKA playland for hosting a birthday party for your kiddo here [ages 1 through 5].

Pros:
- Ease of booking
- Great customer service
- get the entire LEKA for your event
- excellent hosts/volunteers who help with setup and pack up
- safe place for kids to play
- very clean and well maintained facility

Cons:
- The event booking fee is a bit pricy
- A bit far if you stay in Portland/Hillsboro
- The time duration for an event doesn't compliment the pricy booking fee. Time duration should be increased by 30 min.

Review: July 24th, 2023 was my daughter's FIRST BIRTHDAY! How exciting right?! On July 23rd, 2023 My family (My husband, 13 year old TEENAGER, 1 yr old daughter and myself) decided to take my daughter to LEKA Playland because we were told by a good friend to visit the boutique as they are amazing. Upon arrival, I was told that my TEENAGER couldn't go back with us. That she needed to sit in the lobby alone while her 1yr old sister played. We were even told take the TEENAGER to the local coffee shop AROUND THE CORNER!

The reason behind this was to ensure that my TEENAGER didn't play with the toys. WHY ON EARTH WOULD MY TEENAGER WANT TO PLAY WITH THE TODDLER TOYS? This was our FIRST outing attempting to allow my 1yr old daughter explore and it was RUINED.

They have spots for families to have a snack/lunch, massage chairs for the adults and LOTZ of bouncy castles and areas for the littlest to play. The newest edition is a cool area with a ball pit, slide, mini trampoline and areas to climb. The only thing is, the ball pit needs more balls bc its a hard landing from the slide. Hope you guys can fix this! Very nice staff and they encourage moms/dads to play too :)

Review: My family has been going to this place since it opened. This has always been a fun place until recently.  My 10 yo daughter and seven year old autistic son came to me upset and visibly shaken, when I asked what was wrong they said the worker yelled at them to get off a jumping item, I asked my kids why and they had no idea. So when I went to ask the worker she states my kids were not following the rules and stated she told them the rules. I looked at my kids and knew they had no clue. I then asked the worker to please explain the rules to me with my kids there so I knew the rules as well as my kids. ( most mothers do this so when later when  I can remind them before playing.)  instead she just repeated I already told them, over and over. I asked I want to know the rules so I can explain them to my son again later. She refused to and just argued. We decided to leave and will not be back. We will travel to Vancouver or Olympia for our jump houses. Sad the owners were so friendly and staff up until this last year. Keisha the worker needs to learn patience and grace when dealing with children. After a long talk with my kids they said she never said anything to them about rules only yelled at them to get off. Again thank you Keisha for giving my children a negative experience at one of their favorite places.

Response to owners comment

I asked what the rules were of the bounce house in question. Not at any moment did any of the three workers show me the posted rules or that they are online after being asked multiple times. I did not sign a waiver so I was not aware. As a mother that use to go frequently, I walked with my kids and supervised them. The younger girls that worked there before walked around were constantly cleaning the mats and items. I have never seen any of the current staff do this. Typically the gentleman is seen walking around,  the other two ladies are usually sitting talking or on their phones…the customer service has went down hill. They are the face of your company.

Went there today and I was really sad to see what's left of it. So many of the items that were there, are now gone... And what's left is getting pretty run down. My son was bored within 15 minutes and we left.
We really hope it doesn't continue this way... and we'd love to see some improvements, even if that means paying more to play there.

After a face first slide into the pit  worthy of wipeout, he was very determined to get all the way across. The staff is very nice and the room plenty large enough. The only downside was having to clean up, which all and all was much easier than cleaning the hostess' house twice.

Review: We had a planned party and learned something from the experience: We arrived early to set up and had to wait until after our alloted time to be allowed to enter the den. We had been told we were allowed 15 minutes to set up. We were late getting out as we had thought we were still allowed the 60 minutes. It resulted in just over $54.00 in charges. Ill save you some money on your party - do it elsewhere and just bring the kids in to play - you dont get the 60 minutes you pay over $200 for. Just some free advertising.

*Edit following owner response: Now I know why we got the car seat delivered to our party that belonged to the next one and had to deal with her complaints about us taking her stuff. I wish I could say that we were mad about what you believe we were. As local business owners ourselves - it wasnt on our radar until we were still sitting at the octagonal table after our party started. Cameras have time stamps. I acknowledged that we were in fact late departing, but your staff was unloading the following party after we had departed.

Wound up getting asked to leave on time which pissed both my husband and me off due to the fact we had no set up time and it ran into our party time. We got charged an additional amount because we took too long to tear down. Overall not happy with the experience. While my kids love this place I do not plan on booking it for birthdays anymore due to this experience.

Review: It was very clean and quiet since we got there early very good for toddler ages! Parents just need to make sure to be on watch with your toddlers/babies because there is older kids that don’t mind running and pushing the Todd’s and moms just being on their phones and not say anything. But it is very nice and clean! Our new favorite spot for my kid in Longview!

Review: IF YOUR KID LIKE TO PLAY THE “FLOR IS LAVE” THEY WILL LOVE IT. We liked this place as parents too. Found that it was somewhat affordable in comparison to say, Dizzy Castle in Vancouver. The kids enjoyed it, and stayed very active the entire time. Food offerings are limited, and there’s no beer or wine for the adults which is often overlooked at these okay places. More modern options elsewhere make
Sure there’s libations for parents who will be sitting there for hours as their kids play. The bouncy houses were surprisingly quite! I’ve been to other indoor bouncy house places that were unbearably loud. We will be back. Note: adults must be present and you can’t just drop your kid and walk the mall or go to Planet Fitness

Numerous bounce structures and slides

The whole floor is padded very well.

The atmosphere is fun and inviting.

Review: The place was great my kids were having A-blast. Then a little boy decided to assault my child. I asked him why he was picking on my kid. He started to cry his nasty dirty stinky dad said oh am I gonna have to shoot somebody for messing with my kid looking at me. So I got angry. His wife or sister or whoever was with him started screaming and causing a scene so I yelled back. Then all of a sudden the manager comes and asks me to leave.  He didn't ask any questions  Just took the guys side and asked me to leave definitely definitely won't be going back.

Review: Great location, right before Sumas border. Good stop for a restroom and a coffee, or a quick (but not necessary ) bite. A very good indoor playground for younger kids, to stretch their legs.

Well, in our case our small ordering of coffee and a shake were ""in progress"" for more than 10 minutes, since they were serving the drive through first. The guy that waited with me to be served, asked for the money back, dir to a long wait . After I alerted the crew about the long wait, my order was served within a minute. If you want things to be really quick: stop for the restrooms and than drive through for food.

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: Brought our 10, 8 and two 5 year olds here on a hot summer day. We are from out of town but had to come into work for my job for the day. Going swimming was more work that I wanted to manage for just a day trip, and we had planned to go to an out side playground to let off some steam before going home, but stumbled on this place after a Google search. So thankful we chose this instead!!  Love that it was fun for all ages, had lots of seating, and food options. Will totally come back if we're ever in town with our kiddos again!!

Absolutely Amazing – A Perfect Spot for All Ages!

Play Grounds of LaCrosse is hands-down one of the best indoor play facilities we’ve ever been to! From the moment you walk in, it’s clear that every detail has been thoughtfully designed with families in mind. There is something here for every age — from toddlers exploring soft play zones to older kids climbing, sliding, building, and bouncing their way through creative and engaging areas.

The space is immaculately clean — truly spotless — which is a huge plus when you have little ones crawling and climbing around. The bathrooms are modern, spacious, and sparkling clean, and the adorable party rooms are perfect for birthday celebrations or group get-togethers.

One of our favorite surprises was the café! It’s not just your typical snack bar — it has a great selection of food and drinks (including coffee for the grown-ups!) and plenty of options to keep kids happy and fueled for more play.

The pricing is also incredibly reasonable, especially considering it’s all-day play! You can come and go as needed, and I love that it feels very secure — only those who have purchased a ticket receive a personalized entry code, which gives so much peace of mind.

Play Grounds of LaCrosse has truly thought of everything. It’s fun, safe, clean, and welcoming — a total gem for families looking to burn off energy and make lasting memories. We’ll definitely be back again and again!

Review: Good place to wear out kiddos. Pros; the jump pad thing is a huge hit- main thing my 9 year old wanted to do and cheap entry price. Cons; lack of supervision, not very clean, basketball court will have balls flying into the jump pad & ninja course, and lack of seating for adults. My son was super disappointed when kids were just sitting on the ninja course for 10+ minutes not playing, when asked nicely if he could go through they ignored him. I wasn't a fan of almost being hit by basketballs multiple times when I wasn't even in the basketball court. Most of the issues could be easily solved if the areas were monitored better and whoever monitors the areas could do general cleaning.

Review: Feedback Regarding Party Room Booking Experience:

I’m writing to share some feedback regarding our recent experience hosting a party at your facility, which we booked from 6-8PM.

While the children had a wonderful time and we appreciated the timely arrival of the pizzas and the help provided by your on-site staff member, I did want to raise a few concerns that caused some confusion and disappointment.

According to the party room description, the booking includes “access to the facility for up to 10 kids for a total of three hours.” I scheduled our party room from 6-8PM (they have allotted time slots for you to select from) with the understanding that the children would have an hour of play after our reserved party room time (8-9PM). However, we were unaware that the facility itself closes at 8PM. This meant that we did not receive the full three hours of access that were advertised.

Are we advised to arrive early to make use of the extra hour of playtime? Additionally, no closing announcement was made to give us a heads-up before the facility shut down. We only became aware of the closing time when I asked to store the birthday cake (ice cream) around 7:45PM, which was also when we were scrambling to locate misplaced car keys while trying to clean up the party room.

While your staff member was kind and understanding in the moment, I left feeling disappointed that we unintentionally missed out on a full hour of what we paid for. A simple courtesy email ahead of time outlining the facility hours, or a reminder to arrive early for playtime, would have gone a long way toward clarifying expectations. As it stands, the experience felt misleading.

I’m sharing this in the hope that you might consider updating your communication process for future guests. I hope you’ll take this feedback into account for improving the overall experience.

They were SUPER responsive when I asked a lot of questions via Facebook since we had not been there and never made me feel that I was being an inconvenience.  Even up until the day of, I kept having more questions and without hesitation, they were very easy to connect with and very friendly.
Day of, staff was AMAZING!!!  Super accommodating and every single staff there was very friendly, approachable, and always had a smile. Staff was wonderfully helpful with the party room with getting cleaned up (garbage and boxes out) and kept offering to help in any way they could, which was very kind!!!
Our family and all our guests had an amazing time!  PLUS, those of us that tried their coffee, LOVED it!!
We will for sure be back!  And definitely would recommend!!

Three different climbing structures, a basketball court, a ropes course, and lots of bikes and small trikes for kids to ride on.  We had fun.  Best part is you can find a perch as a parent and watch almost the whole facility.  Great indoor play place, sorely needed for lower La Crosse.

Review: Our birthday party here was AMAZING! My friends have a wide age of kids (from 9 years to 3 weeks) and all of the kids had an absolute BLAST!! Theres a toddler area that is SUPER cute! The level of service and cleanliness was impeccable!
The biggest thing for me though was walking out the door to go there and only having to worry about bringing the cake and candle and 3 things of balloons that my 3 year old requested. So relieving that everything is literally there and decorations, plates, etc were all there for us. Even a lighter for the candle! This family truly thought of it all and made it so much fun to just hang out and have fun at the party! For anyone else who has winter birthdays, or just in general, this was a great place to party 🥳

Review: Great option for modern day families that don't have the same family help that people had 20 years ago. Lots of play option,  amazing hours. My only complaint is that I wish there were 2 completely different sides with the same stuff, one side for under 10 year Olds and one side for over 10 year Olds. It's not practical to have older kids bouncing next to 5 year Olds, it's not practical to have grown men throwing basket balls and accidentally having it hit 3 year Olds in the head.  There should be separate or clear plexiglass walls . I also wish the disabled parking spaces have actual signs because when it's just painted on the ground,  the snow covers it. So far they keep the place clean which must be quite a challenge.

Basketball hoops at multiple heights so kids can feel like champions even if they can’t hit a 10’ tall rim. Also a bunch of younger kids enjoying the younger themed areas. The staff at the coffee counter was helpful and polite. Great way to spend a rainy winter day.

Review: We went in opening weekend and understandably it was busy! I expected so much but my kids had a a great time and did not want to leave after playing for two hours! As with every new things the kinks will get figured out. The owners have read through reviews and comments and made adjustments which is awesome. I do think for continued use and respect of materials everyone should be expected to take off their shoes especially as we get into the season of wet snow and ice.

I would have liked a few more spaces to sit or a picnic table in and near the playgrounds. I saw some have mentioned dedicate time for youngers or sensory kiddos and I thought that could be nice as well!

Lastly, I expect older kids and parents to be looking out and making sure they are being safe and respectful! Overall, this is an awesome opportunity for our community for the long and cold winter months! Thank you!!

The monthly/yearly memberships are priced reasonably and we are looking forward to adding this to our winter fun rotation. Memberships would make a great Christmas gift! We also tried the cafe and enjoyed that too. My son loved ordering his capri sun and my iced latte was great and we got both for only $6. My one suggestion would be that it would be awesome if you had a couple of smaller youth basketballs to go with those lower hoops.

We stayed for just over 3 hours and they were upset we had to leave. Yes, there were parents who were not keeping an eye on their kids (like the ones ramming cars on the road towards the ninja course, highly recommend some sort of barrier here lol). But it didn't hinder our enjoyment of the area. Coffee was also yummy & well priced. We can't wait to come back! But also please bring one of these farther north, like Holmen area, so we don't have to drive as far ;)

The Cafe serves food and drinks, and is cleaner than any public playground. It's indoors, so in the winter when it's below 0 outside you can come here and let your kids tucker themselves out running and playing as if they were outside.

Would, and have, recommend to anyone with kids!

Review: Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that my child is 2 and it's not quite a suitable environment for her yet. It’s a cool facility, very friendly staff, and lots to do for children closer to 4 I would say. At 2 years old, my kid was too big for the toddler area, but then got steam rolled a bit as it got busier in the main space. That’s to be expected in any playground with “big kids”. Just a note
to parents for toddlers that it does require you to be pretty diligent. I will say it was much calmer and more manageable from like 8am-9am. We’ll be back, just not during “peak” times.

Just go online, buy your day pass or membership and get the code! If you go twice a month the membership pays for itself. Kids were completely entertained and had a blast while I enjoyed a coffee from the Cafe. Unlike jumpstart and like they say on their website, you are in charge of your kids. There is not staff walking around to enforce rules. Be responsible for your own kids and have a great time. This place is great!!!!

Review: Honestly quite disappointed. I took my two kiddos (1) and (5) there today. I do think this would be a good place to bring your kids if it was to be actively supervised and not remotely monitored. Leaving it up to parents to watch their own children lead to multiple disturbing instances I saw today. A kid literally laid on top of an infant because her mother was supposed to be watching and didn’t. For this reason alone I won’t be returning as often as I had planned! I truly hope they rethink the idea of having it up to the parents. Also the cafe staff is to sanitize on their down time and doesn’t seem to get down time so I’m a little concerned about everything only getting sanitized once a day at the end. The 3 and under is supposed to have no shoes but nobody is actively monitoring it so parents are wearing outside shoes where infants are playing. Also comparing it to an outside park is not the equivalent because you are to pick up after your self and clean up. I would never leave a place messy or not try to clean something up but to actively advertise clean it up yourself is sort of off putting. I do think the cafe prices seemed very reasonable however I was overcharged due to their system having different prices and had a long wait to get a refund for the difference. The website also says they have IPads to be able to buy tickets and that was false they have no iPads at the entrance. I do think if they had it being attended and changed the price discrepancy in the system, put iPads out like advertised it would be a lot better. However after today I wouldn’t be able to go and have peace of mind that a altercation wouldn’t arise. I also witnessed the owners kiddo running around yelling mom without her nearby that was also a little concerning she wasn’t watching her own child. Going to edit it to one star for the terrible response from the owner.

Review: My daughter had an amazing time in all sections of the playground!

From the moment we walked in, the space was clean, bright, and incredibly inviting. The variety of activities kept her entertained for hours – from 4 ft to 10 ft basketball hoops, to slides and multiple different types of jungle gyms, to a bounce thing, and a ninja course, there was something for every age group especially including the toddler area. The toddler area was very clean.

The café was a great bonus – I could grab a coffee and relax while she played happily. Additionally the cheese curds were great! I love how well-thought-out the layout is, allowing parents to supervise easily.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and we can’t wait to come back. Highly recommend for families looking for a safe, fun, and engaging place to spend time together! It will be perfect for us in the upcoming months and years!

Review: I love the concept and think the idea is very much needed in the area. I am concerned the current style of operation isn’t sustainable long term.
-The website clearly explains pricing, rules and how to buy tickets. Despite this it seemed many people either can’t read or felt entitled to disregard the rules.
- Entry was straightforward (clearly listed in the website)

-Pricing is fair and not having to charge adults for admission is a huge pro and draw to take my child here.

-I was anticipating a much more put together space that flowed and was professionally installed.(the 3 play scapes and ninja course were professional grade) The execution/construction was somewhat underwhelming for a commercial space,  particularly the floor in the ninja area with gaps and lips/taping that made it easy to trip.

-I fear this place will not be sustainable without some staff on site to supervise based on the lack of supervision by many parents. The website and signs clearly state no shoes and everyone must wear socks. Most adults were wearing shoes, but still in all the play areas where children were to be wearing socks. To me this does not make sense. Either everyone should be in socks or everyone should be in shoes.  Although my child had on grippy socks a lot of the equipment is plastic and slippery. The floor on the basketball court is very slick and I witnessed multiple wipe outs.
-There were multiple instances where I witnessed older children rough housing in the 3 and under area which made it unsafe for the toddlers. Examples include climbing on the plastic tree house roof, hanging on the chimney almost ripping it off and jumping off the roof, the door was also ripped off the hinges.
The car/bike area is cool but those toys were getting so abused by children outside the posted age rage slamming them into each other, exceeding size and weight limits and no parents redirecting to be found.
I hope the owners rethink having supervised hours or time blocks to make the experience more enjoyable and safe for all ages and not have all their equipment destroyed in the first week of being open.
I recognize that the responsibility should be on the individual parents to respect the rules in place to keep this a nice and safe space for all to enjoy, but based on what I witnessed today people can’t be left to their own devices.
I hope with a few small improvements and individual people being more respectful of the shared space this business becomes a staple in LaCrosse to be enjoyed by all.

Review: The concept of this playground is good. However many older children are running around with no supervision playing in areas that are meant for younger children. It is not a safe situation.  While here, I saw older children slamming the ride toys into other ride toys and the walls. Adults did not take their shoes off and are walking on places where children play on the floor. I saw 7 year olds in the toddler area climbing and standing on the roof of the plastic treehouse with younger children under him. Again, no adult to be seen. The wear and tear on this place is already evident with some doors coming off.
I think this could be a fun place for kids, but I feel that the owners need to spring for paid supervision to keep the equipment and space in good condition and help keep people safe. It should not be a free-for-all. Maybe there should be set playtimes for certain ages.  I’m not sure if I’d bring a toddler back.

Review: It's fun for kids, however I wish they restricted by age, not height. My son is only 5 and he's in the 97% for height so he is right at the top of the ruler for measuring. Seems a little unfair, especially since his cousin is 7 and very very short and is no where near the top of the measurement ruler.

Review: Compact FREE indoor playground for toddlers to Kindergarten children. Just need to scan ID at the front. No age limit although parent supervision is required all the time.

Playground equipment, kitchen toy, kids tables, book & carpet area, big blocks and 2 bouncy houses. Table and chairs along the wall for easy supervision.
No food or beverage allowed in the playroom.

You can rent a room in front of the playroom for a birthday party etc. $50/h, minimum 2 hours. The playroom remains open to everybody even if you rent the room for a party.

Review: I love bringing my kiddos here. Safe, enclosed environment with wide variety of toys and several inflatables. The lady who works there is so nice and keeps the place very clean and tidy. I feel bad for her having to put up with some of the entitled parents who come here though. It's free with a military ID but I've heard people complaining about the fact that food isn't supposed to be brought in (because allergies are a thing!!) And last time I was there someone was complaining that she wasn't watching the kids. That's not her job!!! Parents are supposed to be watching their kids. I mean honestly!!

Review: Sounders is an amazing place for children. Especially, in a state that is cold and rainy a few months out of the year. My son absolutely loves Sounders.
My wish is that they open during hours I can take my son during the week. I believe they close at 11am or 12pm during the week and I'm at work during that time. That said, my son can only enjoy the benefits of Sounders on the weekends. No place can be perfect but Sounders is pretty close. Add a grill and soft drinks and we'd never leave, lol.

Review: The food was a huge pleasant surprise. Absolutely amazing menu and quality for a bowling alley. Probably the best place to eat on base.

Cosmic bowling needed music and less white light, but we still had fun. Equipment was in good shape and plenty of small kid size shoes and balls.

Prices were good, especially with the summer kids bowl free program.

Thanks guys!

Review: The food was a huge pleasant surprise. Absolutely amazing menu and quality for a bowling alley. Probably the best place to eat on base.

Cosmic bowling needed music and less white light, but we still had fun. Equipment was in good shape and plenty of small kid size shoes and balls.

Prices were good, especially with the summer kids bowl free program.

Thanks guys!

The same machine did the same thing to my wife's ball and my friend's. Terrible bowling alley. Only good thing about it is the workers in the food area. They are super cool and provide excellent service every time.

Review: This place is so AWESOME! My little girl is 2.5yrs old and loves going, she calls it the ""bouncy castles"" AKA family room. They have spots for families to have a snack/lunch, massage chairs for the adults and LOTZ of bouncy castles and areas for the littlest to play. The newest edition is a cool area with a ball pit, slide, mini trampoline and areas to climb. The only thing is, the ball pit needs more balls bc its a hard landing from the slide. Hope you guys can fix this! Very nice staff and they encourage moms/dads to play too :)

Review: My family has been going to this place since it opened. This has always been a fun place until recently.  My 10 yo daughter and seven year old autistic son came to me upset and visibly shaken, when I asked what was wrong they said the worker yelled at them to get off a jumping item, I asked my kids why and they had no idea. So when I went to ask the worker she states my kids were not following the rules and stated she told them the rules. I looked at my kids and knew they had no clue. I then asked the worker to please explain the rules to me with my kids there so I knew the rules as well as my kids. ( most mothers do this so when later when  I can remind them before playing.)  instead she just repeated I already told them, over and over. I asked I want to know the rules so I can explain them to my son again later. She refused to and just argued. We decided to leave and will not be back. We will travel to Vancouver or Olympia for our jump houses. Sad the owners were so friendly and staff up until this last year. Keisha the worker needs to learn patience and grace when dealing with children. After a long talk with my kids they said she never said anything to them about rules only yelled at them to get off. Again thank you Keisha for giving my children a negative experience at one of their favorite places.

Response to owners comment

I asked what the rules were of the bounce house in question. Not at any moment did any of the three workers show me the posted rules or that they are online after being asked multiple times. I did not sign a waiver so I was not aware. As a mother that use to go frequently, I walked with my kids and supervised them. The younger girls that worked there before walked around were constantly cleaning the mats and items. I have never seen any of the current staff do this. Typically the gentleman is seen walking around,  the other two ladies are usually sitting talking or on their phones…the customer service has went down hill. They are the face of your company.

Review: We've been coming to the Family Room since it opened and have always loved it. The variety of fun activities was amazing and staff was top notch. It was a desperately needed, indoor play area for this area!
Went there today and I was really sad to see what's left of it. So many of the items that were there, are now gone... And what's left is getting pretty run down. My son was bored within 15 minutes and we left.
We really hope it doesn't continue this way... and we'd love to see some improvements, even if that means paying more to play there.

Review: It was my grandsons 5th birthday. The kids all had a blast in the bounce houses and slides. We cheered one youngster on as he made the leap from one big red ball to another. After a face first slide into the pit  worthy of wipeout, he was very determined to get all the way across. The staff is very nice and the room plenty large enough. The only downside was having to clean up, which all and all was much easier than cleaning the hostess' house twice.

Review: We had a planned party and learned something from the experience: We arrived early to set up and had to wait until after our alloted time to be allowed to enter the den. We had been told we were allowed 15 minutes to set up. We were late getting out as we had thought we were still allowed the 60 minutes. It resulted in just over $54.00 in charges. Ill save you some money on your party - do it elsewhere and just bring the kids in to play - you dont get the 60 minutes you pay over $200 for. Just some free advertising.

*Edit following owner response: Now I know why we got the car seat delivered to our party that belonged to the next one and had to deal with her complaints about us taking her stuff. I wish I could say that we were mad about what you believe we were. As local business owners ourselves - it wasnt on our radar until we were still sitting at the octagonal table after our party started. Cameras have time stamps. I acknowledged that we were in fact late departing, but your staff was unloading the following party after we had departed.

Review: We had our daughters 7th birthday here, they said that the room wasn’t ready and they would come and get us when it was, we ended up with people for the party arriving on time and we still weren’t in the room. Wound up getting asked to leave on time which pissed both my husband and me off due to the fact we had no set up time and it ran into our party time. We got charged an additional amount because we took too long to tear down. Overall not happy with the experience. While my kids love this place I do not plan on booking it for birthdays anymore due to this experience.

Review: It was very clean and quiet since we got there early very good for toddler ages! Parents just need to make sure to be on watch with your toddlers/babies because there is older kids that don’t mind running and pushing the Todd’s and moms just being on their phones and not say anything. But it is very nice and clean! Our new favorite spot for my kid in Longview!

Review: IF YOUR KID LIKE TO PLAY THE “FLOR IS LAVE” THEY WILL LOVE IT. We liked this place as parents too. Found that it was somewhat affordable in comparison to say, Dizzy Castle in Vancouver. The kids enjoyed it, and stayed very active the entire time. Food offerings are limited, and there’s no beer or wine for the adults which is often overlooked at these okay places. More modern options elsewhere make
Sure there’s libations for parents who will be sitting there for hours as their kids play. The bouncy houses were surprisingly quite! I’ve been to other indoor bouncy house places that were unbearably loud. We will be back. Note: adults must be present and you can’t just drop your kid and walk the mall or go to Planet Fitness

Numerous bounce structures and slides

The whole floor is padded very well.

He started to cry his nasty dirty stinky dad said oh am I gonna have to shoot somebody for messing with my kid looking at me. So I got angry. His wife or sister or whoever was with him started screaming and causing a scene so I yelled back. Then all of a sudden the manager comes and asks me to leave.  He didn't ask any questions  Just took the guys side and asked me to leave definitely definitely won't be going back.

Review: I can’t say enough good things about The Village Project. As a first-time mom, I was incredibly nervous about leaving my 6-month-old son anywhere, even for a short time. But from the moment we walked in, I felt reassured. The staff is warm, attentive, and genuinely caring—they took the time to listen to my concerns and learn about my son’s routine and needs.

The fact that they offer as-needed care is such a gift for parents who need flexibility. I’m so grateful to have found a place I trust—it means the world to me to know he’s happy and well cared for when I can’t be there.

Highly recommend!

Review: The Village Project fills such a need in our community. My son has been attending the play date option since the summer. It’s been a lifesaver while we waited for him to age into the toddler class at our older child’s preschool. Anne is so incredibly kind and knowledgeable and hires people who you can trust to take great care of your kids. I plan on continuing to drop in to the stay and play options as well as other one off events.

Review: I've been coming here with my kids for years. It's the only free option for the winter when it's cold and/or raining outside.  Unfortunately this place is very gross and disgusting... The upholstery has tears/rips on them. In some places they have placed duct tape over the tears. The carpet is stained and nasty. Doesn't look like it's been cleaned in years. Every single play toy is falling apart, has cracked chipped paint, and there is an odor of old urine lingering around/on the play toys. Gross!!!!!

Review: Not a mall person at all, but an indoor playground is such a great thing to have nearby! Sometimes it's crowded, sometimes it's empty. Most of the time parents are good about supervising their kids; sometimes there are kids that are well beyond the height limit and they can get a bit wild/rough for the little ones. But I'd say 9 times out of 10, it's a great option to get some energy out on a wet day.

Review: Every time I take my daughter here there are kids too tall or old that are running around in here, either knocking down the younger/smaller kids or making it impossible for toddlers of any age to actually play. They hog the slides by either staying on them, going up them backwards or pushing past the smaller/younger kids. Asked security guard about it and was told there was nothing they could do about it.

Parents either ignore the sign that says ""if you're under this height come on in"" or they don't care, usually on their phones ignoring their kids as they push the younger children around.

Review: Our family went to a friend's birthday party at Scotty's Playhouse.

It turns out that the zip ties holding much of the foam on to the structure have been cut with an incorrect tool, leaving sharp points that can easily scrape kids.

Unfortunately, our kiddo found one of those and got a big long scratch across his belly. He still has the scar 6 months later.

The attendant did give him a
Bandaid but when we contacted Scotty's Playhouse via email requesting that they check the zip ties, we heard nothing. We want this place to be safe for kids.

Please let us know when zip ties are trimmed correctly. Thank you!

Review: Scotty’s Playground is “the tallest indoor play structure in the Northwest.” It is named after Scott Banke who died of bone cancer in 2002 at 12 years old. Although it is at a Christian church, they welcome everyone for FREE! There is a HUGE multi-level play structure with climbing obstacles, crawling tubes, a cargo net bridge, tube slides, lookout observation windows, and more! The playground is cleverly decorated with douglas fir trees, a sun, and a 3-story tall mural! The large play structure is for ages 3-11. Another small structure and foam pads are for infants to 3 years. They also have foosball and air hockey tables. They even sell snacks! The bathroom is clean and there are step stools for the toilet and water fountains. Parents are not allowed on the play structure, but there are tables to sit and watch or visit with others. Shoes are not allowed and socks are required in most of the floor, so there’s cubby holes to store them. It’s all FREE and it looks like they have a donation box in case you want to help contribute to the maintenance and whatnot. I think it’s all volunteers who tend to the playground, so be nice and show your appreciation.

If you choose to give a thumbs-up 👍🏽 or not, I hope you found my review helpful!

It was horrible my guests were miserable and the kids played but quickly were over heated.  I reached out to them to see if they would at least reimburse me and I never heard anything back.

Review: I'm sad because I really want to take my girls here, but they're only ever open during work hours. Hopefully they will open up on the weekends soon. With it being so rainy in Oregon, it would be really nice to have an indoor playground around here.

Edit: Down grading from 4 stars to 1. We brought our girls here to play on Friday around 345 and despite kids playing inside, we were rudely told they were closed, and too bad due to capacity. You're only open for 2 hours today. I SCOURED the website for info, but no where did it say we needed to be there at the opening time, about limited capacity, a sign up sheet, or anything. The lady didn't even offer us a wait time. 30 mins of play is better than none. My girls are crying because they were so excited, and this is the only place in town. I'm incredibly disappointed and will not be attempting to go back. I can't handle anymore disappointment.

Review: Thank you to the volunteers who volunteer their time to maintain and keep the play structure open FREE to visitors. This play structure was built in honor of Scotty Banke at his families church and was paid for by his memorial fund. It says in the website ""that those that knew and loved Scotty envisioned this large new playground being enjoyed by all of the kids in Yamhill County"". So let’s not one star rate this beautiful playground because of superficial reasons such as ""the hours don’t fit my schedule"".

Review: My granddaughter loves this place. Unfortunately I am unable to take her there. The staff do not remind people to keep their masks on appropriately, even though this is a state mandate. I have seen people wearing masks below their noses and last trip four people came in signed in and wandered about with no masks. The staff is quick to admonish people about the shoe policy but do not say a word to those not following mask policy. Unfortunately I have diabetes and my health is threatened by the disregard for others that is practiced at the playhouse. I could not find a way to speak directly to person in charge and hope they read this review

I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: We had an amazing time at this indoor playground! My son had so much fun exploring all the play areas. it’s the perfect spot for little ones to burn off energy. The place was super clean, which is so important for a kids’ space, and the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. They also have a cozy café where parents can relax while keeping an eye on their kids. Highly recommend this place for a fun and safe outing!

Review: As a restaurant owner, I am not typically one to leave bad reviews—but I absolutely have to address something that happened today. I purchased a $16 cheese and fruit plate that was full of old/bruised fruit. I kindly asked if they could remake the plate because my children have sensory issues and wouldn’t eat the fruit. When they remade it, they gave us less than HALF the food that was on the original plate. When I asked them where the rest of the cheese was, they said “the cheese assortment is at random, that’s just how we do it.” It was insanely busy and I didn’t want to cause any delays for other families, but I am SO disappointed. They served me slivers of apple peels on the second plate, FOUR crackers, and a small pile of Swiss cheese that my children obviously wouldn’t eat. I feel like they did this deliberately, as the employees looked annoyed I even brought the plate to their attention. For $16, food should be fresh and stored properly to avoid bruising and spoiling. They would not give me a refund. Though my kids love this place, I don’t think we’ll be visiting again because of the blatant disrespect. I spend hundreds of dollars here a month, so I expected a little more kindness and care. The first photo is what they initially served me, and the second photo is what the replacement plate had on it.

Review: This place is a great place for parents to hang out with other parents, and kids to hang out with other kids. Reminds me of old McDonald's play pits, just big enough for adults to climb in with their younger children to help them down bigger slides. They have really cheap coffee. Not so cheap beer and junk food snacks which are okay. Honestly, the best part about this place is how tired it makes my kid so that he goes to bed easy at night.

The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in months, the toilet seat cover holder was pulled off the wall and laying on the floor, toilets were stained with urine, trash and filth everywhere, no trash bag in the trash can! The health department needs to be called. I would not allow my child to use this restroom. We left immediately. Get your shit together and hire enough staff to clean! Bathrooms should be checked every 30 mins. Wish I had taken a photo but I could not get out of there fast enough. Gross.

Review: This place was so much fun! The price was quite fair, I  spent two hours playing with my kiddo in the tower. There were other adults playing with their kids in there too. A good time was had by all. The staff do their best to maintain it, and we overheard some of them complain they didn’t have the right dusters to get some of the tops of the slides despite their best efforts. They did their best to keep it clean and tidy. The lattes were good, and staff were friendly and courteous.

Review: This place is ideal for playdates, but the cement floor by the tables is a concern. Children tend to slip and fall while walking or running to get a drink, particularly since they often don't wear shoes when quickly grabbing water. I've witnessed numerous slips and falls. It would be great if they installed a floor more suitable for kids. The staff is extremely friendly.

Review: They treat customers differently. We were told 15 min set up prior, then at 1:45 they were rushing us out of the room, saying it was booked, no one showed for 2 hours after, the next door room was in  30 min early setting up, and was still in 20 min after our time were supposed to be out buy. They charged us for graffiti balloons and never said anything about it, they gave us flack as kids didnt go in the play area as most of them were under 3 yrs old. Customer services was bad. Grandson 1st bday, the guy didn't even know how to cut a cake, as we were not allowed to touch knifes. Then he left it on the table.

Review: The staff was friendly enough but it’s super dirty in the play structure, piles of trash between the climbing areas and exposed sharp zip ties all over the places where kids slide and play. It’s VERY dark inside the structure which makes it hard to see when kids are coming and going- an accident waiting to happen.

Be warned- in the toddler area, the netting above is connected to the big kids play area- when they run overhead the netting sags and can super easily lead to a kids full weight slamming down onto your head.

This place is not worth breaking your neck over

That said- my little one had fun

Update: We booked a birthday party here and it went great. They had run of out invites when we stopped by and I don't think anyone reached out to us about the food order like the email said but I might've just missed the call. It wasn't a big deal. I was able to place the food order a few days before and we didn't run into any problems with that. The host was very friendly and attentive. All of the kids had a blast. We will probably do a birthday party here again next year if that's what our kid wants to do.

Review: This is a good place for kids, I guess. My child is autistic and he is tempted to play there. Never plays longer than 10 min. Minimum pay stated on the card $10.50. Counter is closed and you have to walk to their cafeteria to pay. My request to pay for 30 minutes rejected. Been asked to pay $11.42 with explanation that price is raised. Weird amount. Always paid rounded number before. I assumed that caused by my ""stupid"" request. Of course I will go again and pay $15, 20, 30 so on because my son wants to play 5-10 minutes and it is some fun gor him.  Five stars for a good idea and place minus two stars for suspicious pricing and ""rude"" redirection on the empty counter.

Review: No WIFI. When I messaged them asking why, no response. Seems silly for a place like this not to have some connectivity for parents who are hanging out while kids play.

Otherwise, they have laser tag every last Friday of the month - unless a private party reserves that laser tag session, then everyone else is out of luck. Problem is, there's no way to know until you get there.

This happened to us last week (kiddo was heartbroken), at which time we were lied to and told there will be another laser tag session the following week. I mean, why lie?

Food is mediocre at best. Staff isn't all that friendly (though I wouldn't expect teenagers working in that environment would be).

Definitely won't be going back.

Review: This is a fun place for kids and adults.  Yummy food and awesome food selection for a kid play area place.  The charcuterie tray and hummus platter were so good.  And adults can imbibe alcoholic beverages while kids socialize and get exercise.

Also the last Friday of every month is laser tag and parents can leave for two hours.  If my daughter was a little younger, this would be a regular spot for us, but I’ll still take her here when she wants to just for fun (before she becomes a teenager lol).

Great place to throw a birthday party for the little ones! I didn't try the food so unfortunately i can't rate that, but i can say my kid fell asleep on the car ride home!

Review: Great place, love the price for all the kids get and they are always exhausted afterwards from having SO much fun! Friday nights are great from 6-8 you can drop your kiddos off and they get to play Laser Tag, have Pizza and soda; a chance to meet new friends and give us parents a break to go get things we need def perfect for around these holiday times to sneak in some Xmas shopping if you need! The staff even when totally overwhelmed are always so sweet and on it! Appreciate you all! And since there are not many places to bring kids inside to just have fun at a decent price this place is the BEST!

Review: Auburn location is a very bad place I come inside and there’s a lot of people sitting in the middle. They didn’t let my kids to play and move around because they were blocking the infants area. I asked ask the assistant manager “Angela” to refund my money she refused and stated that she won’t refund anything. The Place was so dirty and people were eating pizza inside the games and their Kids were fighting and cussing loudly to everyone, and the workers didn’t care. The place is really not safe for kids. If you don’t want your kids to get sick and to hear all bad words, don’t take them there.

Review: *** TRIGGER WARNING SA ASSAULT HAPPENED HERE***
They somehow deleted lots of complaints from google..

December 2024 Assault happened here!!

I don't usually repost things but as a parent, I can't not warn / notify other parents
We had our daughter's birthday here after this horrific incident and had no idea until this vague post by Jungle Playland posted today...we would not have rescheduled her party here or supported this business another day after this incident or how they horribly and unprofessionally handled the whole situation.. we are sick about this..
Just a heads up in case others parents here have taken their children here or plan to..
Heartbroken and prayers for the affected children and families💔

Review: We love Jungle Playland, the reason i’m giving a one star review is because of the huge safety issue. We had a huge group there today with about 6 adults and 15 kids. Two of the kids dads joined later and after what happened at jungle playland a few months ago i would have assumed they would have had more safety precautions when you sign in. Two of the kids dads joined later in the day and both walked in without signing in and without children because they didn’t know, they were able to walk right in with no children and the workers did not see them. You would think after what happened they would have wristbands to correspond with the children or something. i would love to see a change in the signup for adults and children to feel more comfortable playing there. i was very disappointed it wasn’t different after the huge incident. Jungle playland is amazing, but, the safety of the children should be top priority.

Review: This play center is an absolute treasure! From the moment we walked in, we felt so welcomed. The space is clean, safe, and beautifully set up to spark kids’ imagination and joy.

The staff is incredibly kind and attentive—you can feel how much love and care goes into every detail. My child had the best time and didn’t want to leave (and honestly, neither did I!).

We’ve visited many play spaces, but this one truly stands out. It’s fun, enriching, and run by people who genuinely care. So grateful to have found this place—we’ll definitely be coming back again and again!

Review: We’ve been coming here since they first opened, and my son absolutely loves it every time! He always ends up in tears when it’s time to leave which honestly says it all. He likes exploring all the different rooms, but his favorites are definitely the car room and the new ball pit they recently added.

The owners are super friendly and welcoming, and their kids (who are often around) are just as sweet my son loves playing with them. The space is always really clean, which I appreciate as a parent.

I’m so glad a place like this opened up nearby. It’s not easy finding fun, toddler-friendly spots, but this one is a gem!

Review: New to Puyallup! I’ve been looking for indoor spaces to take my toddler. I found this place via Instagram! Our experience was just ok. I felt as if everything at that place I have at home already. It wasn’t busy but we came in the afternoon on a Thursday.

The pros:
• Super Clean and Tidy
• Nice selection of toys
• Owner is friendly
• One time waver upon registration
• Nice activity for a rainy day
• Great for smaller aged children

The Cons:
• There were renovations actively happening during visit. Ladders, tools, etc.,
• Back office door remained open.
• Loose bolts on some of the equipment. (Saw some children walking around with bolts. Were taken away.)
• No clearly marked area to nurse as an option.
• No music

I truly felt welcomed and this place is pretty new so I’m sure there will be more additions and improvements a year from now. Those are just my initial observations.

He enjoyed the blue room full of trains and cars and action figures it was his favorite. And the bouncy house was a big hit.
I loved that each room had a different style of play music, dolls and babies, cars and trains, jungle gym and dinosaurs!

Review: Very cool place with a lot of neat toys, staff told me this was the third week they’ve been open. It’s very clean and the price is good. I personally think the themed rooms need a bit more work on the toys they offer. Like the car room has this neat Mario electric race track, but doesn’t quite work right all the time. My kiddo got bored of it pretty quick but still went back to it. It’d be nice to have more open ended toys. Maybe some small wooden blocks to build with and the wooden classic train tracks in the car room. It’d be nice to see some picture labels on walls and buckets where the toys are supposed to go to encourage clean up skills.

But that’s my opinion, overall I like the different rooms. There’s a lot to do to keep kids occupied. I will come back again

Reasonablely priced at $13.50 w/card or $13 cash for 2 hours of playtime your baby/toddler/young child can play in their themed rooms. Great place for the kiddos to socialize and explore. You can bring your own snacks or pay for what they have there, the place looks and is consistently kept clean. The playspace after you check in is a no-shoes zone, so socks are a must. Will absolutely come back with my little ones, they had a great time

There were different activities that they could do, ranging from a kids kitchen area, a princess room, a dinosaur area and more! They had some electric toys that they could ride around on, and when the batteries died they inflated a bouncy house. Just a great time for the kids. We were thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness as well. One room would be empty, and the staff would be right behind sanitizing every toy and touchable surface. I could not recommend this place more. Please support small business, this place rocks!

the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha.

If I ever have a birthday party for a group of 2-5 y/o kids, I would definitely aim for having it here because I am so comfortable just letting my kid roam the small place. They always offer a bouncer seat for small babies that come along, too. Just a friendly, helpful bunch!

Review: Wow, what an amazing place for a party! So glad that my daughter requested City Play for her 5th birthday party. I loved that we had the entire space to ourselves for the party. Parents all got to socialize while kids played and there were no concerns over trying to keep track of where they kids were. Everyone had a great time and the party was relaxed, not chaotic like a large indoor playground type of place.
City Play is spotlessly clean and decorated to the finest detail with adorable and real life items that inspire kids’ imaginative play. It’s my child’s favorite place to play.
Best of all, our hosts from City Play (Braelyn and Hope), were incredible. They took care of all the details small and large. They helped with timing, took care of setting up and cleaning up, and even helped to hand out cupcakes and pack up our items at the end. They made sure each detail was handled and the party felt truly effortless. I would absolutely recommend anyone to have their child’s party here, it is worth it. You will be well taken care of!

Review: Phenomenal birthday party for my daughter. Brooke and Braelyn went so far above and beyond to make everything run smoothly I was blown away. I had multiple parents comment to me about how well planned and run the party seemed to be, and I had to tell them it wasn't me - the two women working there deserved all the credit. Not only did they physically assist with all the moving parts (set up, clean up, kid herding, etc.), but they also had wonderful ideas without being pushy about anything. They even had a candle for us, the one thing we forgot.

The facilities themselves are extremely clean and well maintained, and the kids had a lot of fun. I was also really happy that the company doesn't scrape off the top of the tips left for the workers (I specifically asked). These workers work really hard and deserve to be taken care of by their employer, so points to City Play for not siphoning from their tips.

Thanks again Brooke and Braelyn, you two were so sweet and helpful and I'm sure you'll be seeing plenty of those parents again for their kids' parties!

The space is constantly changing and puts children at the center of all the decisions. We have been to others and they don't even compare... Or the toys are broken or limited over time. The staff is welcoming and actively cleaning and reorganizing the space. The only downside is when they get really busy but that's a great problem to have. Come early near open or during the week.

Review: First off I want to say that this is the cleanest play place I have ever been to. Not only is it organized, but the staff is constantly cleaning and picking up toys.
The owners make you feel welcomed and part of the family. My daughter was nervous at first but one of the staff came and showed her around and even played with her in between wiping toys down.
They also don’t make you feel rushed to get out the door when your 90 minutes is up. I live a distance away from this play place and there is one closer (5mins driving) but I will continue making the drive. Hello
Thank you City Play for being so welcoming,  you definitely have a repeat costumer.

Review: Welcoming staff, it’s so clean! They’re constantly cleaning up behind you and disinfecting the toys. We love that it’s family owned and operated- the owners are wonderful and so creative. Everything down to the mobile above the (very nice!) bathroom changing table is built with little kids and parent needs in mind.

Review: City play is amazing! We drive from Gresham just to go there. The owners and employees are so kind and welcoming. There is so much thought and detail that goes into everything. My kid begs to go to City Play. They open early (at 8) which is a huge plus for us moms with early riser kiddos!
We also had my 3 year olds birthday party there and they were extremely helpful and accommodating! They assign a party host to help with anything you could possibly need!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Review: Very fun for my four year old, she never got bored. Everything was cleaned, I couldn’t believe how hardworking all the staff are, they are really on top of things. Sometimes it’s overwhelming, like they’ll clean up while the kids are playing still and then I feel bad about making a mess.  They’re always super friendly though. Wonderful staff.

One complaint is that the floor is extremely slippery. They require nonslip socks but even then, kids fall all the time. My daughter wasn’t even running and slipped and fell and cut her neck on the little bridge. She got really, really hurt. They were nice and made sure she was okay but I don’t think we’ll be back any time soon. Her neck is swollen and has a huge cut. Poor thing. I wish they’d get a better flooring. Have your kid wear super grippy socks or buy them at City Play, theirs are the best.  I also wish there were another restroom. Hard for little kids to wait when they gotta go!

I really appreciate that the owner emailed me after my daughter got hurt to check in!

Review: We live in Milwaukie and discovered this place when our babysitter brought our toddler here on a day out a couple weeks ago, and it was the perfect spot to meet up yesterday with a friend who lives on that side of the river.

Everyone on staff is really friendly and engaged with the parents and toddlers. We had an especially great experience with Jas/Jazz (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!) who is truly excellent at her job. They are constantly walking around and reorganizing and cleaning up toys so all the stations are ready for play.

The play space is incredible! Every station is spotlessly clean, beautiful and perfectly themed with miniature versions of a cafe, home, firehouse, vet, market, farmyard, and gas station! There’s a school bus the kiddos can climb in, a play structure with a fast and fun slide, sensory stations and activity tables. The kiddos in our group especially loved the fan system that makes the play silks fly and the market where they got to fill carts with miniature grocery items and check them out at the register.

There’s no outside food allowed to accommodate for allergies but they do have snacks available for purchase, though I didn’t check prices. Admission is really reasonable for an hour and a half playtime. The bathroom is wonderfully family friendly with a toddler toilet seat, toddler seat with straps, and footstool at the sink, and it’s even stocked with diapers, wipes, and feminine supplies that you’re welcome to use which I thought was a really nice touch.

My one and only criticism is very minor - that the employee room/stock room have a door or baby gate in place of the current curtain. My toddler ran in there a few times and I had to chase him out. Beyond that it was an absolutely perfect experience and we’ve already decided with our friend that we’ll be bringing our kiddos every couple of weeks to enjoy the space.

Review: I am someone that never writes a review but the experience I had at City play for kids is deserving of one.

My family and I hosted our daughters birthday party at City Play & they did and OUTSTANDING JOB!

The are is place is incredibly clean & the hosts do a great job ensuring it stays clean.

They also helped my husband and I set up the decorations. They were efficient, kind, welcoming  and came up with ideas to ensure the decor was prepared and in the right spots while our kids were able to play.

The options of play spaces, dress up options, toys and stations not my kept the children occupied, some of the parents joined them in on the fun.

There were a couple of accidents and the hosts were kind & understanding. Quick to clean up & give options as to how to help the parents & the children.

The hosts were SO on top of it and truly helped the parents be at ease while also ensure that the party came together.

I truly 12/10 recommend City Play and look forward to going back sometime. 🙌🏽

The pretend spaces are fun and engaging, and our toddler loved it. The snack area is a great addition and I love that they have Apple Pay and self checkout. All the toys are still in excellent condition. It makes the pretend play area at OMSI look like a dumpster. (Sorry, I love OMSI, but the space and toys have really taken a beating.) I am just astonished at how polished and lovely it is. Worth the drive from Portland.

Review: I have been taking my toddler here since she turned 2, almost a year now. She loves it so much! It’s small enough that I feel ok with her wandering away a little bit, but there’s so much to do. She gets to interact with other kids, I get to chat a bit with parents sometimes. They alter their layout and activities often enough that it’s something new every time we go in.
However, the best part is the staff and owners. They remember you, they remember your kiddo(s), and while they are picking up around you they are also playing with the kids and it’s so much fun to watch.
I have also taken kiddo to the new place by the mall, Chicky Play Museum, and although it’s super fun and they have yummy snacks, the staff isn’t interacting with the kids or you do it feels much more impersonal. My kiddo likes both places so we’ll visit both places, but as a parent I actually enjoy City Play much more.

Edited to add: I really REALLY appreciate as a parent that they are open for play times all day, as opposed to the other indoor play place where it’s a limited time slot. That makes it hard as a parent of a toddler to make sure we get the most out of our time. So thank you City Play!

Review: CITY PLAY is incredibly clean and well-maintained, which immediately put me at ease. The play areas are varied and exciting, offering a great mix of physical activities and imaginative play options.

The staff and owners are exceptionally friendly and welcoming. They go out of their way to ensure that every family feels comfortable and has a great time. Their dedication to creating a safe and enjoyable environment for kids is truly evident.

I was particularly impressed with the level of cleanliness and organization. Everything from the play equipment to the seating area was spotless. It's clear that the team takes pride in keeping the place in top condition.

We have been to other indoor play places in Vancouver and felt let down with high prices, unfriendly staff and the lack of cleanliness.

Overall, City Play is a gem. It's a fantastic spot for kids to burn off energy and have fun, while parents can relax knowing their children are in a safe and clean environment. Highly recommend!

Review: City Play is our *spot*. I have 3 kiddos, ages 5, 3, and 2 and they jump at the chance to go to City Play. They could play cafe, market, vet clinic, fire station, house, ALL DAY if they’d let us 🤩 They’ve given SO much attention to detail in each space - The creativity of the owners is unmatched. They’re always switching the toys out so the tables in front have new stations every time we visit - my 3 yr old always appreciates that and gets excited to see what’s new. And I get great birthday present ideas 🥳

As a parent, going to City Play is a lovely little break. I don’t have to worry about snacks - They have tons to choose from for purchase. But the biggest thing I rave about to other parent friends is that it’s so clean! Even the bathroom is SUPER clean and fully stocked with everything I need to handle a dirty diaper situation (I don’t need to stress about having diapers and wipes on hand). They’ve seriously thought of everything. My only heads up is that it’s usually chilly in there - My kids never complain about being cold, just me 😆 so I dress accordingly lol

Bring a coffee and enjoy ☺️

The employees are friendly, inviting and very thorough with sanitization and safety. The best part is that it is owned by a local couple with 2 young kids who understand what kids and parents need/want in a play place. I would suggest making this part of your weekly rotation as we have. You will not be disappointed!

No silly filling out online reservations like this new place in town. Nope I just call see if there is a waiting list and get put on. My kid never wants to do a scheduled thing. He wants to go when he wants to go. I hate the online schedule garbage of this other place we have by the mall. But city play has consistently been the best! Not only the ease of getting in but membership prices are freaking fantastic! I also love the owners too and the staff. They make you feel like family and we just have a playdate with our kids. I feel like the other place gives off a your child is just a number vibe. Everyone knows my son and though he is wild and crazy sometimes they open up with full hearts to my spectrum child. The place is CONSTANTLY being cleaned by staff and the self serve snack area is SO convenient for those days momma needs a pick me up w coffees, energy drinks, water and snacks! Honestly take your kids here. You won't regret your choice and get the 12 pass membership!!! Such a good deal!

Review: Don't let the tiny store-front fool you, this place is huge! I was so impressed with how many activities there were for my 6yr old to do. The facility was very clean and everything was in working order. I even saw a staff member replace the battery in a ride-on train - usually things like this can get overlooked so I was quite impressed. The missing star is due to the food. I found the prices were much higher than necessary and my lunch made me feel very sick. So much so that we ended up leaving earlier than intended. This wouldn't normally be something that would deter me from visiting again except that outside food and drinks are not allowed so spending a day at their facility will likely require purchasing food from their cafe. The drinks were delicious however and I did see one family eating Tim Hortons so maybe the rule is not strictly enforced. Excellent place to keep the kids occupied for the day. Despite the food, I still HIGHLY recommend.

Review: I was here months ago and the baby play area was immaculate, spotless. It seems like cleaning has fallen down the wayside because now the pads and toys look a bit grimey.
I would recommend the many staff to do more regular cleaning.
The staff were hosting an activity with music for little kids of about 1-4 year olds but the speaker was DEAFENINGLY loud, not at all safe for little ear drums. There was no reason for it to be that loud, I had to quickly run away with my baby.
Those being said, there are many different variety of things for kids to play with and it is a pretty great place.

Review: We've been bringing our son to OMLC for the past two years — since before he could even walk — and it’s been a fantastic experience every step of the way. We come here at least twice a week, and we even celebrated his 2nd birthday party here! The centre is always immaculately clean, which gives us so much peace of mind. The staff are incredibly warm, friendly, and genuinely care about each child's well-being and development. The programming is thoughtfully designed to support learning through play at every stage. It's clear that this place is more than just a play space — it's a community that supports growing minds. Highly recommend!

Review: ⸻

I recently visited this play center with my 3-year-old daughter, and unfortunately, our experience was disappointing due to the staff’s unwelcoming attitude. While the facilities seemed decent for children, the way we were treated made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.

Staff members appeared disinterested and were not friendly or engaging, especially considering it’s a place meant for families and young children. A smile or a bit of warmth would have gone a long way in making the environment more pleasant.

I hope the management takes customer service more seriously, as it plays a huge role in parents’ decision to return. Creating a positive, friendly atmosphere is just as important as the physical space itself.

Review: I had a very disappointing experience at Oh My Land Club in Coquitlam. I have been to this place a couple of times before and always had a great experience — until yesterday .

While my child was playing in the art room sandbox, he accidentally spilled some sand on the floor. A staff member, who was present, reacted angrily and started scolding us harshly. I apologized several times and even cleaned the floor myself using their vacuum, but she continued to nag and speak in an unkind, confrontational manner for several minutes.

What shocked me the most was her behavior toward the children — she threw slime down on the table where the kids were playing and said, “If you cannot follow the rules of this room, get out!” She also took a small toy airplane away from my child, saying it didn’t belong in that area. This kind of attitude is completely inappropriate in a children’s environment.

I tried to remain calm and reported the incident to the club manager, but unfortunately, he showed no interest in resolving the situation fairly or professionally.

As a monthly member, I’m extremely disappointed and have decided to cancel my membership. I do not recommend this club — the staff are not friendly or patient with children, and the atmosphere does not feel supportive or respectful.

Review: We visited on a busy Sunday morning and had an unfortunate experience when staff took toys away from my 3-year-old daughter while she was actively playing. There was no signage or communication about any rule stating that certain toys needed to stay in specific areas.

She was visibly upset, and I had to help her feel safe and confident enough to continue playing. When I contacted management afterward, I was told that staff may remove toys from children during busy times to “ensure safety.” However, no specific safety concern was identified—only an implication that her play was somehow inappropriate or disruptive.

This approach doesn’t align with the kind of child-centered environment I expect from a play space. We won’t be returning.

You remember American movies about brave firefighters rushing to a call or rescuers on the beach? How they save precious seconds, their amazingly economical professional movements? The teamwork?
And I watched all this with wide eyes here, in the play center, when I reported that one kid had thrown up.
One announcement and a second later, brave employees rush to the scene of the disaster, armed to the teeth with rags, a washing vacuum cleaner and fencing triangles.
5 minutes!
Exactly 5 minutes later, the rough soft carpet was perfect and returned to work.
It took a long time for my jaw, which had dropped in shock, to fall into place from this beauty of professionalism.

Review: I visited oh my land With my one and a half-year-old toddler On a weekday morning. The price was around $15 for a couple hours for both me and him. I thought this was a really good price. My toddler really enjoyed the time at this place. The weekday morning Wasn’t too busy. More people came towards 11/12 PM. I thought oh my land club Had tons of toys and different facilities that would attract Kids of different ages. Probably not the older kids though. Still, probably a fun place for kids up to maybe six or seven years old. My toddler got really soaked while playing in the water Area. I was ready though. I brought A towel to dry my toddler’s hair and extra change of clothes. Also brought a pair of socks for myself and my toddler. I appreciated how they had different things at different times like gymnastics/dance time. I thought it was neat. Because I was visiting from out of town, My toddler really enjoyed this place. I’ll probably be back next time when I’m in town.

Review: Good facility, but don't go there on weekends, they don't have any limit for customers, as long as people come they admit! On weekends all 7 party rooms are full, if you just do a simple math by their capacity you can tell how crowded it is , they even change some activity rooms to a party room on weekends, even using bathroom will be difficult with all these crowds. It is clean and organized, but they should care more about what feelings they are giving to people rather than money. My kids wanted to leave after only 20 minutes!

From a ball pit to a water station and tons of ride on vehicles. Lots to keep kids entertained for hours.

One downfall is the ""no outside food or drinks"", if that's the case why don't you have fresh fruit, yogurt, snacks other than chips and healthy options for food? Also the mark up is insane, $9 for a plain ham and cheese sandwich... over 30 signs plastered on tables and walls.

** Bring your own food, if they are willing to kick people out when they are paying $25 per kid that's bad business.

Review: Pretty decent play club. Our kid really loved the ball pit and the water table. Just let it be known that you NEED grip socks, they sell them at the club but if you have them at home wear them. I'm docking 2 stars because they allowed a sick kid into the club. The little boy had a rash on the lower part of his face, terrible cough and runny nose. Long and behold, my child and I are now sick because of this kid. I'm docking it because they had a sign indicating what symptoms one should not have when at the gym and they still let the kid and his parents in.

One of their employee asked my kid to get out of the dark room bcuz he was playing with balloons. Each child present in that room during the dark room activity was throwing all their stuff around but only my child was targeted. My son felt so embarrassed n didn’t even understand why he was asked so rudely by that girl to get out of the room. I felt so bad for him. I did talk to the owner about it but not sure if any action was taken. I went with my kids on jan 11, 2025 n this incident happened between 5-6pm. I hope you check the cameras. If your staff doesn’t like to be around kids they shouldn’t be working there. She needs to be gentle with kids n should know this is what kids do….! Your employee should be ashamed of herself. I showed the owner exactly what employee of her I was talking about.

Review: I attended a birthday party at Oh My Land and had a very disappointing experience. I brought my two daughters, one of whom has a life-threatening disability that causes low muscle tone, requiring the use of a wheelchair. Since she’s too young for a wheelchair, we use a stroller to accommodate her needs.

Upon arrival, the receptionist refused to allow the stroller into the facility, citing their ""policy."" I explained that bringing my daughter in without the stroller would be dangerous, as I would have to carry her along with her medications and supervise my other child alone. Despite this, the receptionist was dismissive and showed no empathy or willingness to accommodate.

Even when the party host tried to intervene on my behalf, the receptionist remained indifferent and refused to make any exceptions. This lack of understanding and accommodation for people with disabilities created an unsafe and discriminatory experience for my family.

I hope the management revisits their policies to ensure they are inclusive and accessible to everyone, especially families with children who have disabilities.

As a parent, there needs to be more ways to maintain the cleanliness and repairs of the materials. Some side corner guards have come off, smocks on the water area needs to be changed, as well the water looks mucky from our last visit.

Over all, my child has a great time but I cannot overlook some of these issues.

Review: There is a safety hazard. The equipment in the 1-3 year-old area is spaced too close together. It's a balloon-inflated soccer field that needs to be climbed out from the side. Then, when the child climbs out, they will fall to the ground and get up. Getting up would involve stepping on this iron bar (which is not marked in any way) and it would be easy to mistake it for part of the box. It's very dangerous. Fortunately, my child's eyes are fine, but they must have been uncomfortable and were red and swollen for a day before they went down. I'm not the only one; others have also collided with the same object in the same location after we were injured, and when we complained to the manager, we received only a simple apology, saying that there used to be protection here? ！ So why isn't there one now? A very bad experience.

Review: Went on a Sunday (3-5pm) and this place was insanely busy. With multiple parties going on. It was hard to walk through the place as their are parents and children everywhere.

My toddler almost got knocked down several times by bigger kids running at full speed or adults turning around and bumping into him.

Alot of the toys are broken and don't work. Only 1 out of the 3 ride-on-trains worked.
I found alot of the toys are taped together as well as one of the slides.

The leggo area was full of parents just sitting on their phones or in this case a woman was literally laying down on the couch/fort couching, she looked very ill.

The water table is cool BUT all the little fishing rods are tapped and don't work correctly, most of the toys are dirty and slimy. The water has chlorine in it but after touching it your hands do stink like musty water.

There are no healthy options for food such as fruit or veggies, something more appropriate for growing children. Most of it is salty, greasy and fried.

Review: We booked a party room 2pm -4pm, in the clever fox room. Facility was great and play area was a lot of fun for the kids. However I was not pleased with the customer service we received. 3 days before our booked date I received an email requesting we change our start time of the party to 30 min earlier than agreed. I explained this is too late notice, and was told “okay we will figure something out” On the party day, we had 3 employees come remind us back to back that our time ends in our room soon. This was between 3:30 and 3:50pm, before our party ended at 4..  It made me as host feel uncomfortable to have my guests feel so rushed, especially since we were told we could host our party from 2-4, with 4-4:15 pm being our cleanup time.

I did not appreciate being rushed to start our cleanup time before the party even ended. This apparently was their idea of “figuring out a solution” to them double booking themselves.. rushing their guests out the door.. With the prices they are charging for just 2 hours the least they can do is allow guests to have a comfortable time in the room for their allotted two hours.

Based on this, I would not recommend this place for future parties.

Review: We live close by and come here somewhat regularly. I know some have commented on the high price, but I find this place on par with other play centers and much bigger than most. They do have early bird deals that we take advantage of (also the least crowded time of day and this place is a ZOO during busy times).

Recently I have noticed that many toys are broken, I’ve noticed actual garbage in the ball pit, my daughter has hurt herself knocking over a fence that is being held up with nothing more than some painted cardboard boxes, and most worrying of all: uncovered outlets all over the place!! I’ve brought this to the attention of staff and noticed nothing has been done to secure outlets. My daughter is 10 monthd old and crawling. She goes straight for the outlets. How is such a basic child proofing thing missed?

All that aside, this is a great place for my 3 year old to burn off some energy. He has so much fun. As a parent, I see quite a few issues with maintenance and safety. Make sure to keep a VERY close eye on your kids here.  More needs to be done to maintain the space and toys.

Review: We love coming here. It is a great space for our 2 year old to play with other kids while we have a coffee. The only suggestion is that we wish they would get new toys in occasionally. We have been coming for almost a year now (about 2x a month) and it seems to be the same toys. I think it would really keep people coming in and kids more interested if they would rotate new toys every now and then.

** Upated review 2 weeks later.  Thank you for listening to my review! We came back last week and saw many new toys, and our son loved it and had a great time. We appreciate you being on top of it and listening to your customers, I updated the review to 5 stars, and will continue to come enjoy the café!

Review: If you’re looking for a birthday venue for a child’s celebration, look no further….PlayCafe will meet your expectations and more. A fun -filled play area followed by a themed party with as much or as little as you desire. The kids LOVE it and the older than 6’s have options as well. Highly recommended!!

Review: Great location to take kids under 6 to play and give the parents a break! Closed in area for kids to play, with seating available within that area.  A section with tables to sit down for a snack, and an area where you can sit on a taller stool looking into the play area while you work so you can watch your kiddo and work at the same time if needed.

Review: I had been wanting to go and we finally did today 😁 Spent 3.5 hours here. The play area is big with several couches for parents inside. There's a gated off baby area for 0- 18 months. Coffee was good, I ordered a chicken pesto Panini and although I thought $9 was a tiny bit much, it was delicious. We will definitely be back. They have a great party room and packages too.

Review: Good except:  The toys are strewn everywhere, no longer giving each station a theme.  I cleaned up the kitchen and laundry area so my grandaughter could play.   Both employees were busy making food and cashiering.  The focus needs to be shifted to the child's experience, not the adult's food and beverages.  Hire an employee dedicated to walk around and put back scattered toys.

Their chicken pesto sandwich is really good, as well as their coffee. They have meals and snacks for kids as well. It's really clean and our son lights up when we pull into the parking lot.

Review: I recently visited PlayCafe with my two young children, and I have to say, it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. Owners Matt and Michelle have truly created a haven that perfectly caters to both children and their parents.

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that Matt and Michelle understand the unique needs of young families. The play area is incredibly well-designed, with a variety of safe, engaging activities that kept my kids entertained for hours. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully arranged to spark imagination and encourage active play, from the colorful climbing structures to the creative play stations.

What truly sets PlayCafe apart, though, is how well they accommodate parents. The seating area is comfortable and strategically placed so that you can keep an eye on your little ones while enjoying a well-deserved break. The café offers a great selection of refreshments, from freshly brewed coffee to healthy snacks, making it easy to relax and refuel.

Moreover, the entire facility is impeccably clean and well-maintained, which is a testament to the care and dedication Matt and Michelle put into their business. They are always on hand to greet you with a warm smile and are genuinely invested in ensuring that every family has a positive experience.

In a world where finding a place that both children and parents can enjoy equally is rare, PlayCafe stands out as a true gem. It's clear that Matt and Michelle have poured their hearts into creating a space that understands and meets the needs of families. I highly recommend PlayCafe to anyone looking for an all-around great place for kids to play and parents to relax. We will definitely be returning soon!

Review: My little guy was a member here for a few months this winter, and he looks forward to going every time. Toys and play structures are thoughtful and high quality. The staff are kind, and they do a good job cleaning and tidying despite the chaos of many many kiddos.

My only complaint is that their food options for kids are really dairy-heavy and light on whole foods, and they don't allow outside food. My son doesn't really eat anything they offer, which limits the amount of time and money we spend when we visit.

Review: I’ve been here a few times and things were great at first. My daughter loved it. But I took my daughter there last week and there seemed to be a lot of toys missing compared to what was there before. There was also broken toys and the biggest thing was that there was an outlet to plug things in that was right in the middle of the whole play area which was uncovered. What a hazard for the kids. Won’t be taking my daughter here again.

They also need grippy socks n require mom to have socks of course but 12 is pretty steep it's nothing too special but l will probably be back when he's old enough to play maybe when he's a confident walker I just wish it said they charge before I drove all the way there n had my friend meet me, thought it would be a good place for winter but as a single mom can't afford those prices if my child is to young to even enjoy it I think maybe 11 months n less should be free

Review: We did the DIY party package for my daughters birthday. We arrive 30min before the party to set up the decorations. We weren’t allowed to really help any (for liability reason) but this also put a restraint on the party starting at 4. Only the birthday girl was allowed in the play area until everyone could get checked in. Other kids weren’t allowed in until maybe 15 or 20 minutes past 4 (my paid time) due to decorations needing to be put up first. If this was the case I would say 2 workers should have been available rather than 1. I feel it took away from my paid time from the party, especially since the play area closes 30min before the due time (4-6) for clean up. That’s understandable, but not allowing other kids in until check in past the party start time was my only complaint. Other than that, the kids had a blast.

The drop-in pricing is fair, and there are several membership or punchcard options for even more savings.
We homeschool and I’m very excited to be able to bring my older son and work one-on-one with him while the younger kiddos are engaged in play close by.
Also, they are testing out staying open until 8pm on Friday nights. We popped back in with dad in the evening for a local beer and some more play time, did not disappoint!

We came so that our son can play not to eat off of a super limited menu mostly consisting of basic sandwiches and children’s food. There are 8 restaurants within walking distance and we would’ve happily stayed longer had I been able to go get food and bring it in. In other words eat before you arrive but they do have lots of options for young children

Review: A successful business model is contingent on the capacity to maintain and provide quality for your customers. These guys have been doing the absolute opposite. Everytime I've returned here a specific section has required an extra cost when in the previous visit it was included. I could certainly understand if equipment was maintained and/or new activities were added but adding an extra tier to things that were once complementary is absolute robbery. There's a difference between prospering and taking advantage of a demographic because supply is not keeping up with demand. Do better jungle jaks!

Last year, a power outage during our kid's birthday party put a damper on things, but this year, the management went above and beyond to make it right. They offered us free go-karts and trampoline access, even though the previous issue was out of their control. Their kindness and dedication turned this year’s celebration into the best birthday ever for our child! Jungle Jack's is the perfect spot for a fun, memorable birthday party for friends and family of all ages. Highly recommend! Big thank you to the team for making it so special!

Review: I had my son’s birthday party here today and it was well organized and well taken care off! By the time you come in and check in, you’ll notice how well organize the staff are. Our party host was super attentive and helpful with all the set up and just through out the party. I was able to have a peace of mind that it was going to be a smooth birthday party because of their organization.  The food was not only delicious but also my son and his friends also had so much fun!!!! Thank you Jungle Jac for making my son’s 7’th birthday an unforgettable one! I’m well satisfied! 😀 and will definitely recommend!!!

Review: I visited with my family and a few friends, but unfortunately, the experience didn’t live up to expectations. The place is overpriced and not worth the cost. They charge an extra $20 just to use the trampoline, even though it’s inside and should be part of the general admission. On top of that, outside food and drinks aren’t allowed, which makes it less convenient for families.

It doesn’t make sense to pay $20 per child and then be asked to pay another $20 for a single activity. To make matters worse, if your child leaves the building, you have to pay the full admission fee again to get back in. This will definitely be our last visit.

Review: Too expensive, and not worth it!
There’s an additional $20 fee just for the trampoline—even though it’s inside the building and should be included in the admission! No food or drinks are allowed, which makes it even less family-friendly.
It makes no sense to pay $20 per child and then another $20 for the trampoline. Plus, if your child leaves the building, you have to pay the admission fee all over again to re-enter!
This was our last visit to this place!

Review: I know everything is expensive. But 72 bucks for two kids, including trampoline. 5 bucks for an adult…
If I don’t want to go in can I just drop them and leave? Ha

No outside food, but they charge 11 bucks for French fries. I mean they better be cooked in beef tallow and be topped with truffles.

Kids had fun, but this will be our last time. Will look for an alternative.

I don’t blame them, the place is packed make your bank.

There is obviously a market for indoor kids entertainment, hopefully the demand leads to more Competition and more reasonable prices.

The food was delicious and can I just say the girl at party check in (I believe her name was Jaimie) was on top of it, answering all questions and concerns and providing full detail. It’s like she’s the queen of party check in!!
Slides, trampolines, games, ball guns, toddler area, soccer field and the list goes on. They have it all.

Review: It's a nice indoor play center for kids, they have a separate area for toddlers 3 and under. Large trampoline area upstairs, no adult jumpers allowed. Small arcade downstairs with bumper cars. Small selection of prizes and a fairly good selection from their cafeteria (a bit pricier)

50 tokens = $20(CAD)
1 large (16"") pizza = $32(CAD)

Review: That was a nice place for kids to play and also for birthday parties, but they pushed parents to buy socks for the trampoline!!! People could not bring their food and had to purchase low-quality foods from their small menu.
Also, the parking is too small, and there are not enough spots for pick-up and drop-off.

Review: Great place for kids to burn off some energy.  But that is where it STOPS.  So $20 for your child to get in. $4 for one adult to get in to sit.  You can not bring anything in but water.    Trampoline is an extra cost… Oh if you are not wearing the right socks.  That’s an extra cost.  Without any food. Cost of entering the location with trampoline/socks and taxes. Was $40. I won’t be going back there.  I cost is way too high. I was lucky I had only one child with me

Review: We’ve been to Jungle Jac’s many times over the years for birthday parties and the attention the workers give is incredible. The place is very clean for a kids play center, it is well organized and everything is taken care of when you have a birthday party. It’s not super expensive and it’s worth every dollar, here’s why:

Kai at the front desk is incredibly patient and helpful. Hanna, in our party room was exceptionally nice, hard working and helpful. She kept on coming over to ask if we needed anything. Who does that anymore? These employees represent the centre extremely well, as well as every other employees that we came across from paying the bill to spending those hard earned tickets or people cleaning the tables and keeping the place nice and clean.

As a parent, it’s very nice to be able to have everything taken care of for our party and not have to worry about anything like setup, cleanup, food and when to bring the cake. Kids have no idea how stressful it can get, but not here.

In the past years, service has declined everywhere and it’s very refreshing to see that places like Jungle Jac’s are able to keep a family business feel to their business.

Out of the 10 times we’ve been there as partygoers and party hosts, it’s been nothing but consistant and incredible service.

Review: Kids like it here, however almost every time that I come the HVAC system is turned off (you can look at the thermostats and see) and the humidity in the building is very high and gross. Pretty much no ventilation. I wouldn't be surprised if the CO2 was very high as well. They charge so much and should give back a little more.

***UPDATE*** NOV 2024

I went in with a cup of coffee from A&W while with my kids were attending a birthday party, they refused me access and said it was due to allergy reasons. When I got inside I literally saw 100 travel mugs, and also people are bringing their own birthday cakes and other food in which is highly likely to contain more allergens than a cup of coffee.. they don't worry about or check these cakes for allergens (i know people who have brought these things in, they have never said anything),  why is a cup of coffee so bad. This place charges a fortune for kids to play there, and has different rules for different people as well.

Review: We organized a birthday party for my son with 20 kids, and it was a fantastic experience. The kids had a blast in the play zones, enjoying the games and bumper cars. The check-in staff were incredibly helpful and kind, ensuring everything ran smoothly.
We had an hour in the party room, but there was only one person to assist us, which felt like a lot of work for him. Although the kids finished their food, we realized that the unlimited drinks we expected weren’t provided separately, as we misunderstood the package details (if you order food package B for parents with free two pops and coffee, that Pop is for kids as well). Additionally, we found there weren't enough napkins.
It was still a wonderful party. The staff member was very accommodating, not hesitate to refill drinks and assist with separate food orders. Overall, it was a memorable celebration!
We recommend this place to celebrate your kids' birthdays.

Review: The staff at the café are not only unhelpful but also behave very rudely. Unfortunately a lady is working there with arrogant and disrespectful behavior. We expect better supervision in the selection of employees for this center.
In today's world, customer service is the top priority in any business.
As a result, disrespectful staff can have a very negative impact on the business and its future success.
I as a loyal customer to this Centre who used to go there often, now would not recommend anybody to visit jungle jacks again. Bad memories never fade and ruin your best moments 👎🏼

Review: Wasn’t going to bother leaving a review but after waking up the next day with both my kids sick I do not think it is a coincidence.

First off very confused by the 4.3 start review. Came here last weekend with my two little ones and would have left right away if it wasn’t us being there to celebrate a birthday. The place overall is disgustingly dirty. All of the toys are very old, broken, some taped up with duct tape others gave the stickers are peeling off - everything looks like it was purchased from a flea market. The foam matt that is layed down on the floor is practically black, thankfully we all had a change of socks. Along the outskirts of the play area they have disposed of all their old birthday party decorations, old deflated balloons and cardboard cutouts which is all laying there collecting dust. The washroom had a terrible smell and was very dirty with pee all over the floor, I looked up to see if there was a fan but it was covered in at least an inch of thick grey dust. The whole time I was there the lady working sat upfront on her phone didn’t get up even once. This place lacks basic cleaning yet alone any disinfection for the kids. Wish I took photos - Would never go back.

Review: love this place! always clean and being able to bring your own food in is such a bonus. they have a fridge you can store stuff in, a kettle and if i remember correctly, they also offer a microwave(?). they have books, a great ball pit and lots of toys, blocks, anything else your little one needs to have a good time. i just wish it were open longer, that's my only complaint!

Review: A clean and lovely play place for youngsters - we took our 3 year old there and it was the perfect size for him. Nothing was too big for him, but it could use some more staff supervision. Staff takes your money at the front and that’s where they stay. At a quieter time I’m sure it’s fine, but we were there when it was quite busy and it was a little tough to play with everything we wanted to how we wanted to. Would definitely visit again!

Because it was reserved, we mommies could let the children play by themselves without worry. We all sat next to them to eat and chat hahaha 😄 The children couldn't play enough, and they always asked for another hour~
The boss's mom is super nice! She always helped with the decoration and cleaning. Thank you so much~ Richmond is the best Playroom for young babies! No other!

Recently, we did our child's birthday party at JelloLand and Chris, the manager, was so helpful, friendly and attentive, she is amazing! Our friends and family were impressed with the set-up, cleanliness and warmth of the venue. Only suggestion, it may be time to add new stations, playgrounds or toys for regular customers to bring diversity for the kids.

Review: Came here for a birthday party with my son. Everything was good, my son had an amazing time. The venue is perfect for small children as it's very protected. It was our first time here, but we have been wanting to come for some time now, just always hesitated because the price was on the higher end.

The one thing that disappointed us was the attitude of the lady working there. She was not friendly at all, didn't even smile once during the 3 hours that we were there. There is zero customer service. When it came time to leave instead of giving us a 30 min reminder to usher the kids out, she went in at 6pm and shouted at everyone.

I think this is very unnecessary as the kids were having fun. As parents we were already trying to get the kids out of the play area to the best of our ability, but kids don't necessarily respond well to yelling.

I liked the venue, but won't be coming back. We came here to have fun, and this kind of customer service has definitely left a very negative impression for us.

Review: Final Update:
I emailed the playcentre with the information provided in their response and it seemed that they were willing to look into the situation but they ended up going AWOL on me and never took accountability of double booking us in. Not impressed and we will not be going back.

*Update:
Unfortunately we won't be coming back to this playcentre. Originally, we were okay with the expensive rate of $65 for 1 hour of play because all admissions were advertised as private bookings where there would be no other families. However, this must have changed since the last time I was here as when we arrived today, there was another family here as well. I really don't mind sharing the space with other families as this is the norm with all of the other playcentres, but continuing to charge $65 for an hour no longer makes sense. Also, they need to update the information on their website as it is still advertised as private admission bookings.

I wish there was a cheaper option for those who have just one child but my little one had a blast. Place is clean and has a variety of things to play with. We particularly like the ballpit, the slides, and the kitchen play area. I think one hour is plenty of time for little ones to explore the whole place. Will definitely come back.

Review: Fun place to take kiddo to and I love that you can rent the WHOLE place to yourselves. BUT… Went in the morning. Some mats looked like they weren’t put back nicely, like kids played with them the previous day and weren’t cleaned or put back in place. Made me think how much cleaning they actually do after/before each time slot, despite the cleaning tool that was out on display. The ball pit had dirts and hairs of different colours that wasn’t ours. AND we all got a really bad cold a couple days later (got tested, not covid. we didn’t go anywhere else before and after, only this place).

Review: This place is so good for a party and all. We held my son's birthday party here as a private event yesterday, I'am really happy in my decision to rented the facility for the full 2 hrs without any interruption from other ppl. The children had an awesome time we don't need to worry to have complains or crying being upset for not taking turns going down the slide or climbing up the stairs. My boy and his friends are so excited 😊 and happy throughout the entire time. Best part it's open concept you can see them all around area and not worry where their hiding or stuck. I definitely recommend it. 😊

Im basically now going to 365 fundays where its 30 dollars for 2 hours but the gym is maybe 3 times bigger. The pricing change i think is will probably be permanent.

Lots of high chairs for the little kids when eating, and the cake table had a wrap around table skirt already. The ball pit was a hit and super clean as advertised. Perfect for 0 - 4 year olds!! The older 5 year old kids got bored faster as expected but still had a lot of fun, and didn't want to leave! We will definitely be coming back to play again! Plenty of parking spots outside. Many thanks for a relaxing and enjoyable experience!

Review: We had our daughters birthday party here. The staff were so kind and dimmed the lights and played calming music since our daughter is on the spectrum. Her whole class came and it was great because all the things for the kids to do. I loved that there’s also a separate room for the party. They helped decorate and tear down. Definitely recommend this place!

Review: Overall we had a positive experience letting our kids play at Junebug, but a few things I noticed that seemed different than what I expected. Other than a giant ballpit, there were no other play structures or spaces that seemed to be designed for more active play. There were so many wonderful spaces for imaginative and creative play, which my daughter loved. But I know my son was looking for more opportunities to get his energy out.
They have a small more baby friendly corner, but it is not closed off from the rest of the play space. And the rest of the space has several non-baby friendly toys that present choking hazards.
The creative play spaces are all closed off in mini cubicles. So if you have multiple children, it is impossible to keep eyes on all of them at once, making the small toys an extra choking concern.
If you have older toddlers or young kiddos, this space would be great for you! (The kiddo potty and sink in the restroom were a big hit with our toddlers!)
But I wouldn’t recommend it for mamas with babies or younger toddlers who still put small items in their mouths. And it’s not ideal when looking for a place to let your kids run and play to get their energy out.

Review: Junebug is a wonderful indoor play space on rainy or sunny days. The space is clean and inviting! Many different play areas to keep the little ones busy and engaged. I am extremely impressed with the simple idea of having a high chair in the restroom for infants/toddlers so caretakers can use the restroom without fear of the little ones touching the restroom floor. Delaney is a wonderful asset to Junebug with an inviting smile and helpful attitude!!  Thank you Delaney for assisting in us having a wonderful experience. I wish I lived closer to the area so my family and I could come more often.

It was so nice to let the kids run around and play while the staff tidy up allowing parents to relax. I was impressed with the attention to detail. They’ve thought of everything. Even the restrooms have a miniature toilet, sink, feminine products, and hair ties! The nursing room was so relaxing and had a changing table with diapers of all sizes. There is an infant section and a section with desks and craft supplies for older kids.  They also have cute apparel and a little shop area in the front. We will definitely be back! So happy we have a play place in Ridgefield!

Review: This is such a great addition to the Ridgefield community! My kids are just shy of being 2 and 4 years old. They had so much fun. The owners are warm and attentive to the needs of the space and sanitized the toys multiple times throughout our visit.

I could tell they put a lot of thought, planning and time into putting together their vision and bringing it to life. There was plenty for my kids to do and the space feels spacious for people to spread out and play. You can bring your own snacks and food which is awesome. We will definitely be back! 2 hours was plenty of time for my kids to play and enjoy their time. They even give stickers to your kids on the way out as they leave to make saying goodbye a little easier.

They’ve managed to create an atmosphere that feels both open and also so full of activities and opportunities. Around literally every corner is something new to explore. Justina and Delaney were so warm and made us feel at home right away. Love that we can bring our own food in but that there are still snacks for purchase on site. Restrooms in the facility. Parking outside. This is a place that can be enjoyed on any given day with your kiddo 💗

The place is absolutely adorable for both children and adults wanting to interact in a safe community space. The decor is aesthetically pleasing as well as safe for your children and there is so much support for local small businesses. I had a blast there with some of my past students, playing with them myself. Justina and Chase really out did themselves. I have shared this space with both family and friends alike. THEY. WILL.

Review: This is a great place to take young kids. You will need to sign a waiver and take off your shoes when you enter. They have an area to hang coats and store your belongings in cubbies by the door. If you do happen to forget socks like I did, they have a bin of clean socks for you to borrow. They have an area dedicated for babies and a play structure with tunnels and slides for the bigger kids. They also have a little ball field with fake grass which is fun! There is an area with tables and seats if you need to take a snack or lunch break. Over all it was a very nice experience.

Review: Great space! There's an area for kids 2 and under, there's a space with astro-turf to play with sports balls, a climbing structure with slides and tunnels (adults are allowed in too), and an area or eating nut-free snacks. Food is BYO, but coffee, tea, and water are provided. There's one bathroom (I wish it were more) with a potty seat, changing area, step stool, and wipes provided. There are cubbies to keep your bags and shoes and a box of socks to borrow if you need them. The gal running it was extremely friendly and helpful. I wish it were open earlier than 10:30am, but other than that, super fun and tiring!

Review: This is a super fun play area to bring little kids. We came here for a birthday party so it was nice and busy but not too overcrowded. There's a giant tube play structure that kids can run through and climb up. The slides are fun for the kids. They have a mini indoor field for soccer and/or basketball. The toddler area mostly has soft blocks for stacking and climbing and rocking chairs. The scoot cars are a hit with a path for kids to follow around the large play structure.

Review: My son absolutely loves Ahoy Kitsap Playland, and it's become one of our favorite go-to spots in Kitsap! We visit often, and every time, he has a blast — especially with the slides. The whole place is incredibly kid-friendly and safe, which gives me peace of mind as a parent.
The atmosphere is bright, clean, and welcoming. It's clear the staff cares about maintaining a fun and safe environment. One of the best things is that parents can actually sit back and relax while the kids play. There’s plenty of comfortable seating, good visibility of the play areas, and free Wi-Fi — a rare and much-appreciated combination for any indoor play space.
Ahoy Kitsap Playland strikes a great balance between active fun for kids and a laid-back vibe for parents. I highly recommend it to any families looking for a safe, fun, and clean place to let their little ones burn off some energy!

Review: My kids and I genuinely love this place. My kids play non-stop and it gives me an opportunity to sit back, relax, and watch them safely play from a nearby table. There is an area for smaller children that has open ended toy play, as well as the main playground. It’s clean and the staff are very friendly. The only downside is that you can’t bring in your own food/snacks. My kids have fallen in love with the snack bar, which is extensive. They also have hot and cold food options, a coffee menu, milk shakes, ice cream, drinks for kids and adults, etc. I have nothing had to say about this place. We come back and back, over and over again, especially on not so nice days. We drive over from Gig Harbor.

Review: I would have given a better rating if they were more accommodating to kids with severe food allergies. My son cannot eat a single snack option they sell inside but they refuse to allow ANY outside snacks even for babies/toddlers who they do not offer safe food options for. This is severely disappointing considering they sell a TON of food and drinks inside so it’s not about not allowing any food or drinks you just cannot bring your own even with anaphylactic allergies even though they don’t sell fully allergy safe snacks. Seems like discrimination to me.

Not sure if I will be back considering this limitation. For the price of $16 a kid you want to stay more than an hour to get your money worth but can’t bring safe snacks for your kids.

Review: Place is clean and nice. Smaller children's playground is easily good for children 8mo+. The larger playground for children 3yr+ is great as well. Kids easily run around for 2-3hrs.

Snacks are decent, mostly sugar treats and not terribly prices. They now ""serve"" alcohol buts it's not worth buying. It's easily not only marked up 5-7x the price (so $7 for a rainer beer) but it's also their ""policy"" that you have to buy a snack with any alcohol purchase so now it's even more expensive. What a joke lmaoo. If they lowered their beer to $5 and no stupid snack they'd actually sell some.

Review: Hard to find b/c the sign is fairly small on the highway; turn in to the United Rentals road and then go up the hill. Lots of parking. The indoor play area is huge (think of several McDonald’s indoor gyms put together). They have two small birthday rooms with tables and chairs and a sink (up a staircase) but not accessible as far as I could tell. I’m not sure if there is an elevator to get up there or not so folks should ask about that if needed. The kids had a wonderful time though…the family brought food and gifts and the kids played for hours!

Review: Fun place. A lot of climbing, jumping, sliding and places to hide BUT kids always ended up with severe lower GI issues. I ended up with Covid over Christmas after seeing Santa. Do not think it's food related as most items are prepackaged. Other grandmas have agreed about illnesses after visiting when we are arranging play dates.  Need better and more effective cleaning practices I'm guessing.

Review: This place is a nice alternative to the park when it’s rainy/cold, but there’s really not a whole lot for little ones and the area dedicated to them doesn’t have a very secure door, toddlers can just push it open and escape into the bigger area. They also changed the rules so you can’t bring in your own food, which I kind of understand for allergy reasons. The virtual reality area is pretty cool but I’m not sure if the price overall is really worth it to go all the time. I spent a good amount of time trying to keep my busy toddler inside the toddler area and then chasing him around to make sure he doesn’t get hurt by the bigger kids, so we both got some cardio in at least!

Room was small, hot (even with a portable ac that hardly worked), and smelled like wet dog and chemicals. Decorations wouldn’t stick to the walls and kept falling down. They gave us a mop to hold up the piñata by hand on the end of the stick handle. Play area looked packed beyond capacity. Standing room only, parents looked miserable. We were rushed in and out. Bathroom was filthy. Owner was rude and condescending. Spent over $400

Went to a birthday party here which was reasonably priced with a private room.
Would go here again.
They get 4 stars here when it really should be five because they require you to purchase a food item with an adult beverage even after spending at least a few hundred dollars on a party that includes food purchased from the venue.

If you have to leave your shoes in the front why the floors so sticky? The slides and tower is dirty, There is kids sliding down with the cars and the workers do nothing about it. I even complained about older kids trampling me and my child over!!!! They do nothing!!!! The food is nasty. I even saw a worker she had purple hair  dig in her nose and continued to make food.

One of our kids was pushed down a slide, we reported it (as the sign posted says to do) and the lady just walked over and told my husband that the kid wasn’t doing anything that very moment so they did nothing, then why is there a sign to report it? I don’t understand why there a multiple signs posted with rules but yet not one is enforced.

Review: Avoid this place and if you do go DO NOT buy a membership or use a card, only use cash. It’s small and extremely overpriced. Membership is expensive and if you decide you don’t want it anymore they require a months notice and if you are even 24 hours past what they consider the month mark they will refuse your request to cancel and charge your card anyway. Even if you’ve moved and will no longer be using their establishment, which I did make clear to them. They will charge your card without your permission even after removing your card from their system they keep it and use it anyways. It’s absolutely disgusting how administration treats people. They also do not enforce rules and safety. Older kids often trample through the toddler area and at times hurt smaller children. They also run up the slides causing crashes and safety issues. One of the times we were there a child fell through a broken area in the upper level and my husband and I had to climb the big slide and push her up to get her to safety as she was just hanging half way through stuck and her mom couldn’t reach her. And lastly they do allow sick children in which creates an unsafe medical environment as well. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: Very disappointed on both visits. First time we reached there on a Sunday at 11:40 am and were told they have to close the place from noon until 1 pm for lunch break. My toddler was not ready to just
leave of course so we paid and stayed for 20 min. Today I called at 11:45 am to ask if they are open just to make sure as I was going to driver there from mission. I was told they are open until 5 pm. Upon arrival at 12:10 pm we were told it is closed for a private party until 1 pm. Would be helpful if they would have told me when I called in. So unprofessional in my eyes.

Review: Recently hosted a kids birthday party here, and it’s a really nice option that you can rent out the whole space for the 2.5 hours. For the size of the place, for sure recommended. The kids had loads of fun in the different areas, but the slide into the ball-pit and climbing walls were a big hit. Also lots of other toys and set ups to play with. Great for younger kids!

The birthday space was well set up, and they help decorate and basic refreshments are provided. It was very smooth to do, and would recommend highly.

The one slight detractor, especially for kids that age group who are learning to potty train, and don’t want to leave the fun, is that the bathroom is in a nearby business so you have to leave and come back. There is however a diaper change station inside, so good for the younger kids.

Will absolutely be coming back on a rainy day for the kiddo to have a fun indoor play time.

Review: It was our first time at Play Jungle today with my two boys (2 and 4 years old). I love the idea, and it is certainly a better fit for our needs than a place like Play Abby. There are some downsides though:

Pros - Quiet and safe! I love that I can see my kids no matter where I am standing (aside from the party area). They have a fantastic selection of toys and the ball pit and slide was a major hit for both of my kids. I was a little concerned about the lack of bathroom, and while packing up both kids to get to the bathroom was a bit of an ordeal, it really wasn’t that bad.

Cons - the cost. I’d be more than happy to pay $8, but $12 is pretty steep considering what you get. They’ve definitely done the best they can with the space that they have, but everything is really quite squishy and there isn’t much space to actually play. For example the train table in top of the wooden structure is only 1x2, so my kids were frustrated they couldn’t put more than three tracks together before running out of space. The pretend play toys are great, but they are tucked so tight under the wooden structure, the kids can’t really even do much with them. My boys tried riding the ride on toy and there isn’t even room to go more than two or three feet without running into something.

The verdict - I was so excited for something like this to come to Abbotsford! And maybe if they ever upgrade locations I’d be more inclined to come regularity for the $12. Until then, we will definitely be back but it will have to be a special occasion thing due to the cost (I’m sure we’d aren’t the only parents having to prioritize where our money goes these days). I’m hoping for a punch card or loyalty program to make it more worth our while, but without an active website I’m not even sure if they have that.

Review: This is an amazing local gem!
We had a birthday party for our 2&4yo here and it was awesome! The kids had a wonderful time playing with their friends, the party area was spacious and the staff was very accommodating and helpful.
The nursing nook was so helpful for moms with infants and the two play areas worked perfectly to separate the big kids so the toddlers had a calmer space.
There was ample seating for the adults and complimentary coffee was brewed just for our party.
We had 15 minutes before and after the party for set up and tear down and it was plenty of time.  The staff were so kind and offered lots of help. They cleaned up the play area part way through the party to keep things organized for the kids but also were very courteous and gave us lots of space.

It was a perfect party location and I highly recommend it!
We have also been here for midweek playtimes and loved it. Very clean and well organized. Lots of fun toys and play areas for the kids.

Review: Today was my second time visiting Play Jungle. My five-year-old daughter and I love the chill atmosphere. My daughter has high needs and gets easily overstimulated, so coming to a place that isn't super loud or overwhelming is a treat! If you're a parent with a baby, this is a great spot for you too! There are lots of baby- and toddler-friendly things to do. The woman on staff today was extremely friendly. I forgot her name, but she bakes special treats and sells them there. I also purchased a beautiful boutique dress for my daughter, as they have many cute items for sale. We'll be back soon for sure!

So many options to play with and the room is the perfect size to keep an eye on them no matter where they’re playing. I loved that was able to sit back and relax on the couch while the kids entertained themselves the entire time which was really nice compared to Play Abby where it seems I have to follow them around more. The staff are lovely, offer coffee which is really nice. The bathroom offsite was not an issue for us.
So nice having a place like this close to home. We came from Mission and will definitely be back. Super reasonably priced and love that they offer memberships

Review: Decent play place with complimentary tea and coffee - I didn't try so can't speak for taste. $10 for an hour was the perfect amount of time for my 1.5 year old . Employee was very friendly and came around and would clean up a few times during the hour. Tables for parents and noticed a high chair for littles.

Compared to our usual visit to Bounce Play Cafe it was a little underwhelming but as still kept my daughter busy.

Daughter was in white pants and left in white so place is clean haha

Would have loved to see a wooden gate keeping the cafe from the play center to keep the kids more contained. Not a huge deal but had to keep bringing my daughter back and away from the shoes.

Being from Langley decent location to meet up with Abbotsford friends and lots of parking.

Downside:
- The blue side is incredibly fast and in my opinion dangerous and very close to the wall. Those kids are flying fast into the wall and it's only a matter of time before a kid breaks a leg. Other parents shared my fear. After once down the slide we didn't return to that pit.

- Change table which was nice and a plus but bathroom off site. Potty training currently (thankfully in pull up diapers) so had to go off schedule. I couldn't imagine if she was freshly out of diapers.

Our active toddler had the time of their life and even our infant had a blast! There is an under two specific section that was great and the larger section that was really well set up with all types of “obstacles” and equipment. It was very clean which I appreciate. The staff cleaned up and did light general cleaning/disinfecting while we were here which I appreciate even more. We will definitely be returning when in the area again and if we lived here would come regularly.

Review: I would like to inquire about the rules of your indoor playground. I brought my two children to play, and they were having a wonderful time, making friends with all the other children.

While playing and running around, one of my children coughed a couple of times, which is completely understandable as children may cough lightly due to physical exertion. However, I felt deeply offended when two other parents—who, in my opinion, were dressed quite inappropriately for a children’s indoor playground (revealing clothing that I didn’t find suitable but chose not to comment on, as I prefer avoiding unnecessary conflict)—reported my child’s minor cough to your staff.

I explained to your staff that my children are not sick; the cough was simply a natural result of running and playing, and nothing more. Despite this, your staff repeatedly came over to wipe down every toy my children touched, seemingly pressured by these two individuals. This created an uncomfortable and stressful atmosphere for us, as it felt like we were being unfairly singled out.

As a result, we chose to leave after only half an hour, cutting short what should have been an enjoyable visit for my children.

This kind of treatment is simply not appropriate. It left us feeling unwelcome and unfairly judged. I would appreciate a response regarding your policies and how you handle such situations in the future.

Review: Brought my two nephews and son to the Southcenter location to get some energy out. Three kids (two of which are mobile toddlers) and one adult can be hard so it was nice to have a place to contain them all 😆

We came on a Friday so it was a little more expensive than a weekday but that was fine. My 18 month old loved watching the older kids run around a play and I had plenty of room to sit and chill.

A huge plus was the young man working. He was so sweet and helpful! My son was asleep when we got there and he offered to turn the music down for us. We didn't need to but the fact he even thought about it was very accommodating. He engaged with the boys when they talked to him and was very patient. Good employees are so important at a place like this!

The employees are great at steering the high energy older kids away from my little one who just learned how to walk.

Review: Went here for the first time with a 2 year old and a 6 year old. Play area is nice, tall slide is hard to get into top area is only like 24 inches tall so adults be weary following kids its very akward to fit in. Ball pit is more like a single layer of sad balls 😄 not like when we were kids. There is a mini obstical course in the back only like 3 obstacles long but still nice. There is a closed gate only attendants open. Seating for parents on side, shoe bins for kids shoes.
There is a little toddler area, just keep an eye on your kids bc some parents don't. My daughter had her face spit in bc a boy wanted her to get off a swinging log, then some older kids went into the toddler 😑  area and were being rough with the toddlers with the blocks.

Review: We had my daughter's 5th birthday here recently and it was awesome. The party room is spacious (we had about 40 guests between kids and adults) and everyone had room to sit and visit. The staff was very helpful and friendly. It was a bit of a splurge, especially since we chose to rent the space on a weekend, but we got the room for nearly two hours plus an extra hour of play time for the kids to play after that, so for the absolutely great time the kids had it was totally worth it.

Review: Our recent experience hosting a birthday party for our four-year-old at Safari in Southcenter Mall was a resounding success. The hour of free play was a blast for the kids, and the accommodating staff even allowed us to store our items in the room. Despite a previous booking, the room was impeccably clean and well-prepared. The provided amenities made the experience hassle-free, and though it was pricey, the value was evident in the joy our child and her friends (and the parents) experienced. Safari at Southcenter Mall exceeded our expectations, providing a memorable and stress-free celebration. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch party venue that delights both kids and parents alike.

Review: Safari is a playspace for little kids inside of Southcenter Mall. It's a pretty big space and offers a private room to rent for things like birthday parties which is great. There's not too much room for parents to sit inside as it gets cramped quickly. Everything is padded and safe which is amazing. You purchase time to be in there at the front and they have little cubbies and a bathroom. This is a good place to pass an hour or two with kids to get some energy out.

Althoguh we're charged same price bringing in my 1 year old who could not walk.
To be charged the same price for the infant.

Other than the price issue. My 2 boys, 5 and 6, had a blast. I was worried it would be set up for younger kids. Which it is a bit smaller than other indoor play places we've been to. But my guys had a good time despite.

It's also secure they always have some one by the exit/entrance area so no kids are taken out. All of our guest had lots of fun money well spent. Will be planning another party here in the future.

Just a great person to have in front and to explain how things go. I told her she has excellent customer service skills which is at times a rare thing when out now. Keep up the great job Jaida and thank u!

Review: Kids empire is such a wonderful time for the kiddos to run all their energy out! This particular visit Rashel helped with a horrible tantrum my 3yr old grandson had. It came so natural for her. He calmed down almost immediately. The other staff, Jaida, Jason, and sky were just as awesome! The entire staff showed professionalism. They had some people eating outside food today. Which is clearly posted not to do. The staff handled it with the upmost professional manner even when the customers got very rude. I recommend this establishment to anyone who has little ones. You can go shop or eat then come back all you do is show your receipt to gain entrance again. This is great because we feed the kiddos and then return to play. Thank you to the staff for being so loving to all the kids and checking up on us adults to. Ten out of ten! We will be back!

Review: Auburn location is a very bad place I come inside and there’s a lot of people sitting in the middle. They didn’t let my kids to play and move around because they were blocking the infants area. I asked ask the assistant manager “Angela” to refund my money she refused and stated that she won’t refund anything. The Place was so dirty and people were eating pizza inside the games and their Kids were fighting and cussing loudly to everyone, and the workers didn’t care. The place is really not safe for kids. If you don’t want your kids to get sick and to hear all bad words, don’t take them there.

Review: My sister and I took our kids there on 06/20/25. Our kids are 11 months, 3, 4, 4 and 11. When we first arrived it was fine. The manager checked us in. There wasn’t very many people there at all. We THOUGHT the staff was pretty friendly at first. My sister took her 11 month old in the infant and toddler section to play in which my 3 year old followed. There wasn’t very many also two other children in that section much older. Well at that point is when she noticed a male staff member with long hair start watching her and the kids. She started to feel uncomfortable. Our 4 year olds decided to go into the infant and toddler section to play for a moment with the younger kids and that’s when the staff member told them they needed to get out because they were too big. Never said a word to the much older kids in there or the parent with them. Well all of our kids including my sister got out. None of us were in the area any longer, but for some reason the team never kept watching us and following us around. My sister decided to take her 11 month old back in there for the last 10 minutes we were there and he continued to watch her. My 3 year old came to me at the table and I asked her if she was ready to leave and at the point she walked over to the infant and toddler section to ask my sister if she was ready. Wasn’t playing, didn’t touch anything. Had just walked over to ask if she was ready. The team member walked up to my 3 year old and asked her if she was wearing a diaper. My 3 year then responded no. He then responded with okay then you need to leave this area. This is very inappropriate. My daughter is 3. She doesn’t understand. She wasn’t doing anything. My sister was right there and he could have talked to the adult instead of ambushing a 3 year old little girl. He should not have been questioning her under garments period! At that point we gathered our stuff. I informed the other staff members of what happened. It’s very upsetting. I left my number for the manager and have yet to speak with him. I really thought the place was a cool place, my kids loved it, but I really don’t think we will go back. I don’t think I will ever recommend this place. I was very creeped out by the situation. I thought it was very inappropriate for an adult to question a child like that. I don’t ever want my kids to feel uncomfortable.

We were lucky and got the same host for both parties and she was amazing, always making sure we had refills and helping out. Book your parties here all the time.

Review: My 4 and 6 year olds had a great time!  There is also a big separate area for toddlers and crawlers.  It's really big with lots of climbing and sliding and a disco dance room.  It was pretty clean and love that shoes must be off and must wear socks.  The air conditioning worked great and there were lots of table and even outlets on the walls to plug in and lots of tables.  Small thing but love that they give you a paper receipt.  (I keep track of my spending by keeping my receipts and logging them in.)  I love that they are open afternoons/evenings, but wish they opened at 9am.  My kids are at an age they get up at 6am so waiting until 10am for them to open was stressful.
The bathrooms were clean but there are no paper towels or a trash can, and only 1 hand dryer even though there are 2 sinks.  The 3 of us washed our hands then stood around and had to wait for that one hand dryer.  If they are not going to have any paper towels they need one of those foot or elbow openers on the door so you don't have to touch the handle.
It is also a downer that their birthday parties are in the open.  No separate room or temporary room dividers.  There was a birthday party right in the middle of the area with snacks and drinks and pizza and baloons.  My kids wanted to be a part of it and it was a downer telling them they are not invited to the party that's going on right next to them.
The reason I gave only 4 stars is YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BRING IN FOOD!  I spent $44 and could not even bring our own snacks.  There is no other kids place that does not allow you to bring your own snacks.  They want you to spend even more on their JUNK FOOD.  They say you could leave and come back.  Yeah, after going through the battle to get them out the door you want me to go through the battle to make them leave, pack them in the car, go home or out to eat ($!), then pack them up and come back.  Because of this we will come back but our visits will be few and far between.

Review: Went for my great nephews 1st birthday which was great.  But things to know (especially with summer almost here), they make adults take shoes off even if you're not doing anything and then if you don't have socks you have to buy some - probably on website but I didn't look.
Then it is slick because of the floors with socks.  There is a little dance room my 7 year old slipped and nailed his head on the hard floor, I went up and asked for ice and told them what happened and they gave me ice (3 staff members just standing there)and one said I hope he's OK ... no really caring but saw another kid with an ice pack that my husband said fell on his ear.  Omg they have this other thing that I thought was something to crawl up with a bunch of ropes but watched several (including my own kids) that all just fell from the top to the bottom that looks extremely painful/ dangerous but mine are fine but didn't let them do it again. It was very clean and not too busy which was great.

Review: Brittany is great. Most of the staff are fairly friendly. It is always clean, bathrooms included, it is very pricey though and I think they would benefit from a flat fee unlimited membership. It is way more expensive than the other kids places in the area (urban air, sky zone, monkey bizness.) We always get the punch card but it’s not much of a discount.

Review: This place is not safe. I booked my son fourth birthday party here and was very excited for him to experience his birthday at this location. Today we attended with his cousin and it was just her first time going. There were so many people in the building. It seems like a fire hazard you could barely move without a person being in your way. Children were not being supervised by their parents, Some kids were throwing plastic bikes down the slides. Kids were riding plastic bikes in the little motorcycle area, blocking other children from being able to drive the electric vehicles and putting themselves at risk of having their toes ran over. It was absolute madness. I will not have my child’s birthday party here. It is not safe. Parents are not supervising their children and There are not enough Staff working to ensure that people are following the rules and behaving in a safe manner. I do not think I will go to this location again.

The kids had sooo many things to do and never got bored once! They were playing pretty much the entire time!! We had to call them all in for pizza, came, and presents haha! Depending on what package you get, you can bring in outside food which is nice for appetizers and a few extras.

The staff were all very friendly, accommodating, very present, and made sure you had what you needed when you needed it. Ashley, our party host was excellent!! She was on top of everything…checking in on us…making sure we had what we needed if we needed something. We loved all of the decorations and things provided by them to.

The setup and organization was excellent. I felt the party was so much smoother with having a host as helping hands and knowing she was there was super comforting so we could entertain. Thanks for a great experience!!! Definitely will be coming back!!!

Review: We had a great experience for our birthday party. They offered us a discount to bring our own food and cake instead of having them provide it. The staff is attentive and friendly!
They had everything decorated cute and ready to go when we got there with plates, cups napkins and drinks.  Plus the goodie bags at the end! It was a very easy party experience for us.

I didn’t see my birthday kid for pretty much the whole party she was having so much fun 😁

Review: Great play facility, and the staff was great, but I would not recommend it.  Very poor management.  I had to wait 30 minutes to be admitted, even though I had signed their waiver online, because there was only one staff member working the front gate and more than one birthday party starting at 2:00.    I missed 30 minutes of my grandsons party.  And then, when the pizzas never arrived the manager refused to take any responsibility, not offering any discount and threatened to “blacklist” anyone that leaves a bad review.  I guess I’m “blacklisted”

Review: Horrible birthday party experience! Paid for the meal package ($40 per kid) but pizza never showed up. Kids were starving and my birthday boy even got sick because of it. Ok fine, things happen. However we were offered no compensation whatsoever for the inconvenience. Manager didn't understand how we were inconvenienced. He went on to tell me that if I or any of the party guests leave bad reviews, we will be ""blacklisted"". Disappointing customer service to say the least. I wouldn't return even if i wasn't blacklisted. I would highly caution against booking a party here.

I must shout out to Noah though, our party host. He went above and beyond to try to make up for his managers behavior. Fantastic service from him the entire time. This guy is management material!!!

Review: This place is so AWESOME! My little girl is 2.5yrs old and loves going, she calls it the ""bouncy castles"" AKA family room. They have spots for families to have a snack/lunch, massage chairs for the adults and LOTZ of bouncy castles and areas for the littlest to play. The newest edition is a cool area with a ball pit, slide, mini trampoline and areas to climb. The only thing is, the ball pit needs more balls bc its a hard landing from the slide. Hope you guys can fix this! Very nice staff and they encourage moms/dads to play too :)

I took my three kids here to play 8, 12, 13 all well behaved kids my wife signed the waiver prior ( long time ago and my wife was not with me) I had no clue that an 18 year or older had to stay and supervise them so I just wanted to walk around the mall for a minute and come back I didn't even get a quarter way through the mall and my oldest daughter texted me and said they got kicked out because a parent was not there they did not wait until I got there before they kicked him out they were standing outside they did not give us a second chance just kicked them out within 10 minutes of playing I just think that sence I didn't know we should have gotten a chance to come back and play people know how much this place costs with 3 kids and only 10 minutes to play what is this world coming to.

Review: My family has been going to this place since it opened. This has always been a fun place until recently.  My 10 yo daughter and seven year old autistic son came to me upset and visibly shaken, when I asked what was wrong they said the worker yelled at them to get off a jumping item, I asked my kids why and they had no idea. So when I went to ask the worker she states my kids were not following the rules and stated she told them the rules. I looked at my kids and knew they had no clue. I then asked the worker to please explain the rules to me with my kids there so I knew the rules as well as my kids. ( most mothers do this so when later when  I can remind them before playing.)  instead she just repeated I already told them, over and over. I asked I want to know the rules so I can explain them to my son again later. She refused to and just argued. We decided to leave and will not be back. We will travel to Vancouver or Olympia for our jump houses. Sad the owners were so friendly and staff up until this last year. Keisha the worker needs to learn patience and grace when dealing with children. After a long talk with my kids they said she never said anything to them about rules only yelled at them to get off. Again thank you Keisha for giving my children a negative experience at one of their favorite places.

Response to owners comment

I asked what the rules were of the bounce house in question. Not at any moment did any of the three workers show me the posted rules or that they are online after being asked multiple times. I did not sign a waiver so I was not aware. As a mother that use to go frequently, I walked with my kids and supervised them. The younger girls that worked there before walked around were constantly cleaning the mats and items. I have never seen any of the current staff do this. Typically the gentleman is seen walking around,  the other two ladies are usually sitting talking or on their phones…the customer service has went down hill. They are the face of your company.

Review: We've been coming to the Family Room since it opened and have always loved it. The variety of fun activities was amazing and staff was top notch. It was a desperately needed, indoor play area for this area!
Went there today and I was really sad to see what's left of it. So many of the items that were there, are now gone... And what's left is getting pretty run down. My son was bored within 15 minutes and we left.
We really hope it doesn't continue this way... and we'd love to see some improvements, even if that means paying more to play there.

Review: It was my grandsons 5th birthday. The kids all had a blast in the bounce houses and slides. We cheered one youngster on as he made the leap from one big red ball to another. After a face first slide into the pit  worthy of wipeout, he was very determined to get all the way across. The staff is very nice and the room plenty large enough. The only downside was having to clean up, which all and all was much easier than cleaning the hostess' house twice.

Review: We had a planned party and learned something from the experience: We arrived early to set up and had to wait until after our alloted time to be allowed to enter the den. We had been told we were allowed 15 minutes to set up. We were late getting out as we had thought we were still allowed the 60 minutes. It resulted in just over $54.00 in charges. Ill save you some money on your party - do it elsewhere and just bring the kids in to play - you dont get the 60 minutes you pay over $200 for. Just some free advertising.

*Edit following owner response: Now I know why we got the car seat delivered to our party that belonged to the next one and had to deal with her complaints about us taking her stuff. I wish I could say that we were mad about what you believe we were. As local business owners ourselves - it wasnt on our radar until we were still sitting at the octagonal table after our party started. Cameras have time stamps. I acknowledged that we were in fact late departing, but your staff was unloading the following party after we had departed.

Review: We had our daughters 7th birthday here, they said that the room wasn’t ready and they would come and get us when it was, we ended up with people for the party arriving on time and we still weren’t in the room. Wound up getting asked to leave on time which pissed both my husband and me off due to the fact we had no set up time and it ran into our party time. We got charged an additional amount because we took too long to tear down. Overall not happy with the experience. While my kids love this place I do not plan on booking it for birthdays anymore due to this experience.

Review: IF YOUR KID LIKE TO PLAY THE “FLOR IS LAVE” THEY WILL LOVE IT. We liked this place as parents too. Found that it was somewhat affordable in comparison to say, Dizzy Castle in Vancouver. The kids enjoyed it, and stayed very active the entire time. Food offerings are limited, and there’s no beer or wine for the adults which is often overlooked at these okay places. More modern options elsewhere make
Sure there’s libations for parents who will be sitting there for hours as their kids play. The bouncy houses were surprisingly quite! I’ve been to other indoor bouncy house places that were unbearably loud. We will be back. Note: adults must be present and you can’t just drop your kid and walk the mall or go to Planet Fitness

Review: The place was great my kids were having A-blast. Then a little boy decided to assault my child. I asked him why he was picking on my kid. He started to cry his nasty dirty stinky dad said oh am I gonna have to shoot somebody for messing with my kid looking at me. So I got angry. His wife or sister or whoever was with him started screaming and causing a scene so I yelled back. Then all of a sudden the manager comes and asks me to leave.  He didn't ask any questions  Just took the guys side and asked me to leave definitely definitely won't be going back.

I know they just opened, so I will be updating my review when / if needed.
The play area is great, I just wish there was more color to the equipment and toys. My son won't stop saying ""the grass is grey and dirty""  🤣 but he's two.
the cafe does lack a lot of food items for both adults and young children. I know they are working on expanding their food soon though.
We are loving the indoor play area though. This town definitely needed it . We did get a play pass so it's nice they offer a discount when buying passes.

Review: This place is very clean & my kids love all the play areas. They have a full espresso bar, pastries, & snacks. However they have changed their time slots to overlap making it not as great of an experience. The play area is much too small to accommodate that. That one change led to the play area being overcrowded by adults. Adults take up way more space than the kids leaving the kids with much less space to run & play. I wish they would go back to their old time slots that did not overlap. The overall experience would go back to being more enjoyable. Sadly I’m glad I held off on getting the membership.

Review: Navigating play places with small kiddos can be daunting…not here! Today was our first time there and I’m currently 40 weeks + 1 day pregnant with 2 under 4 and they needed to get some wiggles out.

Check-in was seamless and I was immediately put at ease seeing the equipment and how much padding and soft toys there were that were friendly enough for my 1.5 year old to run around with her bigger sister. Everything is in easy eyesight to keep track of multiple kiddos at the same time. I didn’t feel like I constantly had to rescue them while they were playing because there wasn’t anything too perilous to try out. It wasn’t overcrowded with too many kids because you reserve time blocks and they have capacities. The play area is made for kids specifically in the 0-6 age bracket so I wasn’t worried about a rogue 10 year old smashing into my toddler.

Highly highly recommend for any parents with young kiddos! My two tips would be to make sure you bring grippy socks so there’s no slipping on the tile (I believe they also sell some there) and if you’re solo parenting or can’t bring an adult wingman - caffeinate before you go because drinks are on the outside of the play space and your young kiddos won’t wanna wait for you to drink your drink to play haha. I was able to get a snack/drink break after about an hour or so which was great, but something I’ll keep in mind for next time if I’m going alone in the morning.

Thanks to the Bonkerz team for a great experience and a safe space for the youngins to play! Gives me so much less anxiety than most open playground spaces ❤️

Review: Well, let me tell ya, as a parent of four lively young’uns, finding a place like Bonkerz Indoor Play Cafe here in Wenatchee feels like hittin’ the jackpot.

This place is downright brilliant! It’s like they’ve thought of everything for us parents who just need a moment to sip a hot cup of coffee while the kids are safe and havin’ a ball.

The whole setup is fantastic. The play area is padded, super well-lit, and you can see your kids wherever they are—no blind spots at all. I watched ‘em clean every nook and cranny while I was there, and let me tell ya, they’re on top of their game. It’s clear that safety and cleanliness are top priorities.

What I really love is how much fun the little ones can have. There’s all kinds of stuff to keep ‘em entertained—climbing, pretend play, you name it—and it’s all designed for kiddos up to six years old.

Meanwhile, we grown-ups get to sit back in their comfy café area with plenty of seating, enjoy a cup of coffee, and maybe even plug in our phones or laptops if we need to. It’s perfect!

They’ve got flexible options for families too, like single play passes or monthly memberships if you’re a regular, plus bundles for those of us with more than one kid who love a good deal.

I just can’t say enough about how glad I am to have Bonkerz here in town. It’s the kind of place that makes you feel welcome, lets the kids burn off some energy, and gives parents a little breather. If y’all haven’t been yet, go check it out. You’ll leave happier than a kitten with a ball of yarn.

Review: My 3-year-old son and I have been coming here for about 6 months. We love it. We love it more than any other indoor play place in the major Portland area.

Favorite things about it? It's safe enough that your kiddo can play while you sit at a table. The coffee is amazing and I am a total coffee snob. The ladies who work here are phenomenal! They are just the biggest sweethearts. The menu has great options at affordable prices, but the best part of the menu is this adorable muffin tin deal. You order different little snacks at a dollar a piece and they come in a muffin tin for your kiddo. So cute and so smart.

My only complaint about this wonderful place is something totally out of their control. Not enough kids playing during the weekdays. My kiddo won't play unless there's somebody else to follow around. They do have this awesome online counter on their website where you can see, live, how many kids are playing. Unfortunately, they are just almost never is kids playing during the week.

Review: We’ve been coming to Wildlings Play Place in Oregon City since last year, and it has truly become one of our favorite spots! My daughter Olivia absolutely loves it here, we had her birthday party here back in March, and we’re back again today for a fun Spider-Man playdate (which we won through their Instagram contest, so fun!).

The space is perfect for both big parties and everyday play. It’s clean, beautifully designed, and super parent-friendly. I really appreciate that there’s only one entrance/exit, and it’s right by the register,  it makes it easy to relax while the kids play. The staff is always so kind and helpful, and the owner is amazing very hands-on and clearly cares about creating a welcoming, safe environment.

Whether you’re looking to host a party or just need a great indoor spot to escape the rain or heat, Wildlings is a total win. We’re so thankful to have this place in our community!

Review: Aside from this play place being extremely tiny, the owner, Darcy, is incredibly rude. My family and I got turned away because I had my service dog with me. She demanded a certificate proving he was a service dog and by law and ADA there is no such thing. I asked her to show me what certificate she wanted me to bring in and I’d happily apply for it and yet she said she had no idea what it was or what it looked like. She didn’t have any of her facts straight on this matter which resulted in us leaving with unhappy kids. I’m at least happy this situation happened before we paid. We ended up taking our business to Raindrops Playhouse in Happy Valley and they gladly accepted us. In the end it worked out for us because they charged exactly the same for so much more and much more affordable food. We also appreciate being able bring in our own snacks if we wanted. Now we know where to go to in the future and to AVOID this unfriendly establishment. Picture of my service dog calmly laying down next to me while my kids played and where he continued to politely stay for almost 3hrs.

I sincerely hope that this new business owner of Wildlings can realize that kindness goes a long way and hope she does some research on this matter so she doesn’t offend someone else with a disability and service animal.

Review: We took our toddler here for the first time yesterday and I know he enjoyed it. The staff were friendly, accommodating, kind, and understanding when dealing with neurodivergent customers and having to work with the sound of children play-screaming in the background and all around. There was a party going on in one of the party rooms, but you wouldn't have known aside from the staff asking if we were part of the party or if we were separate, or the sign for the door. Any noise was very well managed by the design of the space and/or adults involved.

The play structure was sturdy and age appropriate for the target age range. Toddlers will have a difficult time getting up to the slide due to a ledge that's a bit on the high side, but my husband and I were both able to climb up and hang out in turns to help our toddler get up the final ledge. The rules of the play structure and establishment in general are simple, easy to follow, and reasonable.

My husband and I were surprised at how easy it is to hold a conversation in the eating area. It was incredibly clean and well kept all throughout the establishment. There is nice noise balancing throughout the whole place. We ordered a half Hawaiian half meat 16 inch pizza, a Mediterranean salad, some popcorn chicken for the tot. It was all delicious and had great flavor. My toddler is a picky eater, especially about his chicken nuggets, and he was more than happy to eat their popcorn chicken and said they tasted good. Despite the party also needing food prepared for them, we received our order quite quickly. The staff are very efficient in their kitchen space.

We were there from about 4:30pm-6:30pm on a Friday night. On our way out, we were already discussing returning again sometime. It wasn't terribly chaotic and it wasn't too quiet. It was honestly just right. Keep it up, Wildlings!

I was so grossed out by the hairy pizza I will never return. I did provide 2 stars because they allowed us to bring in our own cake (no hair)and the little kids had fun in the small play structure.

Review: Cool to have in the neighborhood. My kiddo loves it and he and his friends have spent multiple hours mostly occupied while the adults got to hang and talk. It's a little pricy but it has happy hour times with a lower rate and offers a monthly pass now that would be worth it if you went more than three times a month. They have snacks, food, coffee and alcohol and I really appreciated having the space to hold conversations separate from supervising.

I will say my toddler enjoys it but is afraid of coming down after climbing up and it's maybe best for kids a little older and more independent.

The play equipment is clean, well-maintained, and fun. Other places are dirty, broken down, and run by disinterested teens - so this is a delightful place. It’s like everything I want in a playground very close to Portland. $16 per kid over 2. Open 9am-7am on Saturday!! No random two-hour window etc. Reasonably priced birthday parties.

Good value and providing what families want without a zillion up charges. Forgot socks? Can buy a pair for $1.50 at wholesale cost.

Rules are clear, visibility is good, so this is a great place especially for ages 2-8. Babies are welcome and kids under 2 are free with a sibling. My baby crawled around on the floor and that was fine. Picked her up with it was prime time for three year olds to rampage through here (as they should!!). Then it quieted down and we could play some more.

There’s a nice little corner for some wall-mounted items. Soft support block against the wall for babes learning to stand.

Bigger kids could have fun here too. Everything is reasonably priced, friendly and attentive owner who is open to feedback and tweaking everything until it reaches as close to perfect as a place with kids can be. We were there during a birthday party and it was great, not too crowded. The coffee is really good, kids food is simple crowd-pleasers, and there is beer/wine for grown ups if they want it. But everyone was still watching their kids and intervening as necessary. Parking is plentiful. Area is well-kept and feels new. Bathrooms are spotless. Tables are wiped and sanitized between uses. Crumbs swept up. A fast-filling water fountain with cups right next to it so no nasty water fountain.

Baked goods are fresh and tasty. Beautiful murals on the walls. Wall outlets accessible from every table. Fire extinguisher readily accessible. A kiddo had a scraped knee outside and they staff got out a big first aid kit and helped them get patched up.

Some of the steps getting up were a little big for 2-3 year olds, but that may have been by design so they don’t climb parts that might be difficult for them. It seems like it took some time but they ma aged to get up eventually.

Absolutely worth the drive. In an era when places try to give you less and charge you more, this place delivers excellent value in a beautiful location. Let’s help keep it nice and pristine for a fellow mom and small business owner. Best one in the area!!

Review: We love coming here. It is a great space for our 2 year old to play with other kids while we have a coffee. The only suggestion is that we wish they would get new toys in occasionally. We have been coming for almost a year now (about 2x a month) and it seems to be the same toys. I think it would really keep people coming in and kids more interested if they would rotate new toys every now and then.

** Upated review 2 weeks later.  Thank you for listening to my review! We came back last week and saw many new toys, and our son loved it and had a great time. We appreciate you being on top of it and listening to your customers, I updated the review to 5 stars, and will continue to come enjoy the café!

Review: Good except:  The toys are strewn everywhere, no longer giving each station a theme.  I cleaned up the kitchen and laundry area so my grandaughter could play.   Both employees were busy making food and cashiering.  The focus needs to be shifted to the child's experience, not the adult's food and beverages.  Hire an employee dedicated to walk around and put back scattered toys.

Review: I recently visited PlayCafe with my two young children, and I have to say, it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. Owners Matt and Michelle have truly created a haven that perfectly caters to both children and their parents.

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that Matt and Michelle understand the unique needs of young families. The play area is incredibly well-designed, with a variety of safe, engaging activities that kept my kids entertained for hours. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully arranged to spark imagination and encourage active play, from the colorful climbing structures to the creative play stations.

What truly sets PlayCafe apart, though, is how well they accommodate parents. The seating area is comfortable and strategically placed so that you can keep an eye on your little ones while enjoying a well-deserved break. The café offers a great selection of refreshments, from freshly brewed coffee to healthy snacks, making it easy to relax and refuel.

Moreover, the entire facility is impeccably clean and well-maintained, which is a testament to the care and dedication Matt and Michelle put into their business. They are always on hand to greet you with a warm smile and are genuinely invested in ensuring that every family has a positive experience.

In a world where finding a place that both children and parents can enjoy equally is rare, PlayCafe stands out as a true gem. It's clear that Matt and Michelle have poured their hearts into creating a space that understands and meets the needs of families. I highly recommend PlayCafe to anyone looking for an all-around great place for kids to play and parents to relax. We will definitely be returning soon!

My only complaint is that their food options for kids are really dairy-heavy and light on whole foods, and they don't allow outside food. My son doesn't really eat anything they offer, which limits the amount of time and money we spend when we visit.

But I took my daughter there last week and there seemed to be a lot of toys missing compared to what was there before.

Won’t be taking my daughter here again.

Review: We did the DIY party package for my daughters birthday. We arrive 30min before the party to set up the decorations. We weren’t allowed to really help any (for liability reason) but this also put a restraint on the party starting at 4. Only the birthday girl was allowed in the play area until everyone could get checked in. Other kids weren’t allowed in until maybe 15 or 20 minutes past 4 (my paid time) due to decorations needing to be put up first. If this was the case I would say 2 workers should have been available rather than 1. I feel it took away from my paid time from the party, especially since the play area closes 30min before the due time (4-6) for clean up. That’s understandable, but not allowing other kids in until check in past the party start time was my only complaint. Other than that, the kids had a blast.

The drop-in pricing is fair, and there are several membership or punchcard options for even more savings.
We homeschool and I’m very excited to be able to bring my older son and work one-on-one with him while the younger kiddos are engaged in play close by.
Also, they are testing out staying open until 8pm on Friday nights. We popped back in with dad in the evening for a local beer and some more play time, did not disappoint!

We came so that our son can play not to eat off of a super limited menu mostly consisting of basic sandwiches and children’s food. There are 8 restaurants within walking distance and we would’ve happily stayed longer had I been able to go get food and bring it in. In other words eat before you arrive but they do have lots of options for young children

Review: We have been visiting The Wild West since it opened, but today in particular deserves a special review when I was visiting with my 3 kids, 8,6, and 2 and we had an incident with our oldest who is autistic, and Trish and Tom went above and beyond to deal with it, and help us with us great professionalism.  This is a fantastic play centre located in Westport Town and it is absolutely no wonder they got voted ""Children's Playcentre of the Year"". The fabulous sensory room is a huge hit with our autistic son and the play centre as a whole caters for all our kids. We have had many a birthday party here over the year, the setup is brilliant and the food is fantastic! You can be guaranteed your child will leave here happy. The staff are amazing at their jobs. As for the cleanliness it deserves a 12/10!! The place is absolutely spotless, tables always cleaned efficiently and the toilets are always lovely and clean. The play frame itself is cleaned regularly. Overall this place is absolutely amazing, keep up the great work everyone and thanks for providing us with a lovely safe place to bring our kids at such fantastic value.

Review: Firstly, the staff was extremely rude and unprofessional. Instead of being helpful and ensuring a pleasant experience for guests, they displayed indifference and a lack of respect. Moreover, I witnessed staff members mocking customers, which is completely unacceptable and highly unprofessional.

Secondly, the cleanliness of the facility was appalling. The place was visibly dirty, with trash scattered in certain areas, and the floors were not well-maintained. In an establishment designed for children’s entertainment, maintaining proper hygiene should be a top priority.

I urge you to take immediate action to improve both customer service and hygiene standards at Play Center. I also request an official response outlining the steps you plan to take to prevent such issues from occurring in the future.

Review: We had a great visit to wild west play centre. It's very spacious and has so much to play on that kids had plenty of room. The dining area for the parties is a nice distance away from the play area, so kids wouldn't be tempted to be running back to play during eating. The size of all the climbing areas was ideal for my 4 and 3 year old to play on. The owner was very friendly and helpful. We got the train to Westport to add to the day out, and Wild West is just across the road, so not much walking for the little ones.

Review: A nice playroom for children with slides and an obstacle course. Also a place for little ones to play.  Tables and armchairs for parents. Of course, you can order food here - fries, pizza, nuggets, coffee, tea, as well as some bars, water or canned drinks.  I recommend taking a family set every day, it includes a few things in the set. Take some change because there is also a vending machine with stuffed animals and other paid attractions for children. I recommend it for rainy days. The admission price for an 8-year-old is 10 e, and the price for the kids menu - fries with nuggets - 5.20 and for family plates, about 12 e. Coke in a can 2e and Kinder Buenos 1.5e. Also, the price is not that bad yet.

Review: 🏰 The play area is huge and accommodates children of all ages, from toddlers to primary school level 👶🧒👧👦. It's perfect for keeping them entertained when the weather is gloomy outside 🌧️. The only downside was the food, which was just okay, nothing too special 🍔. But as long as the kids are happy and having fun, that's what truly matters! 👍 Overall, I highly recommend it for an enjoyable day out with the little ones.

Review: Great place to bring the kids of any age. There's a section for under 3's with comfortable seating to keep an eye on them. The older kids have the rest of the place to explore. There is seating in most sections  if you want to move around with them while they play. There is a soccer and basketball area. Plenty of members of staff are always around keeping an eye for the kids that can get a bit over excited. Nice food area for hot and cold food, teas and coffee and very reasonably priced. Great place to visit. They also provide birthday parties. Was back again the kids again had a great time as per usual. Would definitely recommend.

But we were immediately greeted and helped right away so that put me at ease, and even the community in there, everyone was so nice.

My son actually cries every time its time to leave cause he just wants to keep playing, he loves it so much
And it's a perfect place for parents too since they have a cafe you can get your caffeine fix that most parents desperately need to be able to keep up with their little ones and you can enjoy your coffee and relax knowing that your little one is safe in an enclosed space and that you can watch them play from all sides
So parents can get the small break that they so desperately need lol
Highly recommend other parents to try this place out for their little ones
And all the staff is super friendly 10/10 customer service

I hope this business gets tons of great reviews- reviews are like gold for small businesses and it goes so far for them-this is just a reminder to leave reviews so we can continue to help small businesses like this thrive every way we can :)

Review: Very disappointed with this place. Food was terrible, took forever and very overpriced. One of the workers was acting like this is a museum where things are for display only and not a play area for children picking up toys every 5 minutes after the kids. We also walked into the play area with shoes on a few times to check on our kids and she would run in after us mopping and sanitizing. Don’t get me wrong we are clean people and love a clean tidy area but this was next level making us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. I did not like the atmosphere or the customer service and will definitely not be back.

Review: Our first experience was absolutely wonderful! My 2.5 year old enjoyed the well thought out play areas. We got there early (9:30 Saturday) when there was only two other children and when there were about 20 others (11am), it got a bit crowded but it was our nap time anyway anyways. In the almost 2 hours we were there, staff cleaned up several times, which was reassuring. Drinks were great and I’m excited to try some food next time. Definitely coming back and getting a five pack of play passes!

Review: 5 stars due to a few factors :
- We’re a member and our 2 year daughter loves it!!! They keep brining new toys so it’s not boring
- someone keeps sanitizing and cleaning up the places, so the place is definitely neater for the number of kids you see
- this is the only place I’ve seen where their cafe aspect and the play aspect is great. We parents have a place to sit down and enjoy their bomb drinks like falooda and Dubai chocolate latte while the kiddos have fun
- I particularly liked that they have a dedicated space for kids <2 so it’s safer
- we hosted my daughters birthday party during the weekend (VIP BASH) and couldn’t have been happier. While the venue charge is slightly higher than what you see other places,I would say it’s 100% worth it because - you get the entire place to yourself and your party, we had kiddos from 2-8 everyone enjoyed equally, it’s athletically pleasing place so decors fit very well, kids get free ice cream tickets and they loved it!! Also most guests tried their Falooda and left great reviews
Overall, worth it!!

My only feedback is that they conduct events (like Blueey and Easter) and I wish it would be free of charge for members. If not, we tend to double pay. Otherwise, this place is awesome!! Recommend it for frequent use as well as parties!

It makes zero sense to pay that amount when I could buy something permanent at home for far less.

Review: Wow what a great place with such a great staff! They welcome you into this new cafe that’s also a playhouse for kids. I was in need of some caffeine and found this spot nearby but I’ll be back with my daughter again. They’ve got a good amount of options for their cafe menu and I really enjoyed my drink which was a special option that day.
While I drank my iced coffee, I watched the kids play while their parents drank and watched. The place is clean and has plenty of options for the kids to enjoy for some time. Also, they have made it safe for the kids too, so you don’t have to be with the kids at all times. I’ll definitely be back for another drink and snack, but with my family next time.

Alot of non english speaking families not watching their kids, had my 1 year old punched by a much larger boy with no parent in sight. Kids hoarding toys or not letting smaller children access to certain areas and parents just ignoring their kids all together. 2 and under area not enforced so no safe space for babies. Wont be back.

Review: It’s alright — cute, but small play area for littles. $14 per kid is too much imo for an indoor playground like McDonalds. They even charge for infant 6mo and older.

Also, the owner uses a couple of tables for herself and it made us feel a little awkward. Seemed like a lot of paying customers had to stand around. Owner seemed to be caught up chit chatting w her friend and baby while the barista was obviously swamped. Not a good look.

Maybe if the owner was helpful, the barista would’ve had time to clean the play area.

Review: As a mom of two little girls ages 3 & 4, I know how impossible it is to find a clean & “young kid” friendly place where my girls can go play without me having to follow them around like a helicopter to make sure they are safe. The high top tables at Little Pandas lets me keep an eye on them while still enjoying a tasty drink. They entertain themselves and always find another kiddo to play with.

Now for the more important part of this review; I have read through some of these other reviews and I am shocked at what I have read!

-The owners (husband and wife) both introduced themselves to us when we first checked this spot out and we have had multiple great interactions with them since! They are a huge reason I decided to grab the membership because I truly feel that this is a safe environment for my girls and I.
Even my daughters love looking for them when we arrive.

-the owners should NOT be policing your children! Watch your kids, make sure they are playing nicely and if they are stealing toys from kids or running and being wild, HANDLE THAT YOURSELF! This is not a daycare!

-If anyone going to this place has children, you know how hard it is to keep a play room clean and organized when there are multiple kids running around and dumping toys out. How many of your kids actually put things back where they found it at this age?! I have seen their employees walk the play area cleaning and organizing which I think is great. But then 3 seconds later, I see kids dumping toys back out.

-I am a business owner myself and can appreciate that this couple is trying to provide for their kids and still get work done while their NEWBORN baby sleeps in the stroller right next to them. They don’t need to talk with you or focus all on you. Enjoy their space and let them be business owners/ parents!

-If you hate crowds or going when it’s busy, then don’t go during their peak hours! It’s as simple as that. Same thing with going to the Everett’s children museum! Don’t go to a kid place on a weekend and then be shocked that it is busy. You learn what times are the busiest or most crowded and you avoid it. The building is only so big! Use common sense. They literally offer cheaper play during their slower day and times.

-They even go above and beyond to provide FREE diapers and wipes in their bathrooms because they are also parents and know that sometimes we forget and need those extras! Those small touches in my eyes are amazing.

-this isn’t a restaurant! They offer the usual toddler snacks and some tasty pastries plus fun drinks. Bring your own snacks if this isn’t enough for you. Or hit one of the many restaurants located on the same street.

- People will always find something to complain about or use hurtful statements when they are jealous of something. This family created a  beautiful place that most moms are just wishing to find when they need a minute without having their kids climb all over them and their kids can go burn off energy while interacting nicely with other kids. This is that place 🐼🖤

The drinks and snacks are great and I’ve always experienced great customer service even when the cafe is busy. I love that I can supervise my daughter and do some reading or listen to an audiobook. The owners have been very accommodating and have asked for feedback. Even while trying to care for their own family, they keep the place clean and safe. I appreciate having this place when it’s cold or rainy or even on days where I don’t have the energy to go somewhere like the Children’s Museum or trampoline park. It’s perfect for getting out of the house and not being completely drained after.

Review: We’ve visited Little Pandas Play Cafe a number of times and our kids have absolutely love it! The space is clean, the owners are welcoming, and the staff is super friendly. The delicious drinks are an added bonus!

We also decided to host our little one’s first birthday party at the cafe and it was an amazing time! Azka and Kishaan worked closely with us to make sure every detail was taken care of. Their attention to detail and desire to help ensure things were going smoothly (while planning and during the party) really helped me execute everything as planned. We opted for the “open bar” and our friends were raving about the drinks all evening. All of the kids who attended could not get enough of the play area. I am so glad we chose Little Pandas Play Cafe to host our event. It was a wonderful experience working with the whole team and we would absolutely consider them for future parties.

Review: This place is really cute. I wish I could give it more stars but really would recommend the owners putting a limit on the amount of kids able to play at a time! I also wish there was a younger age limit. My almost 2 year old had a great time but I had to really watch out for the larger kids that were more aggressive. (I guess parents should do a better job of watching their kids play too). Otherwise great spot for toddlers!

Update ok I see on the website the space can hold 33 kids….ummmm no way! Also the age limit is 6.

Do yourself a favor and spend the day at little pandas, such a clean and safe environment for kids. I love that they have so much to choose from! The big play structure is my sons favorite he will run around and go down the slide for the longest and when he’s ready to slow down a bit there’s still so much fun to be had with the imaginative play area, such a good balance for littles. I have also noticed the staff going in the play area pretty often to maintain the stations and wipe toys down and that’s something you don’t see too often at kids places! This is our favorite spot in our rotation of places we go.

Review: Poor time management and not the cleanest place to take kids. Have been to this cafe twice and the first time was by myself and was one of the 5 people there and noticed all of the staff were all using their phones while the owners were on there computer/ phone unaware of the two servers taking forever to complete orders because they were both chatting and giggling.
The second time I went was with my two daughters and was surprised how both owners were even less interactive with customers and staff. When I went to play with my girls on the toys noticed how there was either like or food on the slide and the small toys weren't the cleanest. While I played on the slide and play toys with my one daughter noticed the man/ owner staring at my daughter like a creep. Not paying attention to his own baby who they always kept covered up in a stroller. When I started to clean up the toys noticed the same man standing next to his child still in the stroller as he or she was the entire time I went both times. And he was staring at me while I walked around and occasionally leaned over to pick things up. Made me so uncomfortable and aside from them not having many options to chose from on their food menu I would say they had verry poor customer service. The owner was kind of a creep always staring at me or my girls over his glasses mostly when I had my back turned. Honestly not sure why this is considered a cafe and in particular wouldn't recommend bringing your kids here.

Review: My catchphrase is: Google doesn't lie! Most review apps/sites (looking at you, Yelp) are rife with ridiculous reviewers complaining about unrealistic or down right insulting criticisms...

But the parents at this cafe have given mostly stellar reviews and I agree - it's organized, has a clean bathroom very close by, the cafe has tasty chicken empanadas and other goodies, plenty of seating, and a wonderful play area for kids mostly 3 and under. I brought my toddler and he LOVED it here.

It's nice that there's a variety of play: toys, make believe structures, a playground structure, and area for infants.

There's tons of moms and parents that fill up the place. That's something the cafe can't control other than the max occupancy but honestly it's a good sign that it's so popular. It can get crowded and a bit loud, but for a weekday morning the kids can still run around and I thought it was honestly not bad noise level wise.

It's very affordable. I've been to many places that you need to either pay hourly or for an unlimited day pass but it's usually kind of dirty. Here, they have an affordable price (check their site) and we ended up staying for almost 3 hours! Now that's a deal.

When we sat down for lunch, my kid looked out the big windows and kept pointing at the cars/vehicles passing down the road! It was the reason why we ended up buying a 5-Day pass!

The part that made me appreciate this cafe was the customer service. Two ladies at the front were amazing and always so welcoming - they communicated everything about our order from how long it would take to even offering to reheat it (my toddler needed a diaper change). We can't wait to come back!

PS: There's a Goodwill across the parking lot so that's a bonus. More reasons to stop by here.

Review: This place was so much fun! My kids had a blast and the coffee was tasty. However, what really impressed me was the front desk cashier / manager (I’m not sure) helping us find my daughter’s lost toy. She was crying so hard over her lost dinosaur and he personally went into the play area to search for it, and he found it! He didn’t have to do that, and we really appreciated it - most play places just take your number or tell you to come back and check later.  Great place, highly recommend.

A little smaller than expected but enough for little ones to see and do to keep them busy for an hour or so. Id say it’s best for kids 3 and under based on the size and activities. Floor is extremely slippery, even with grip socks. I saw multiple kids slip and almost slipped myself. More padded mats or rugs in the space could help.
A fun rainy day activity for my 3 year old, but not somewhere I’d rush back to.

Review: If we could leave 6 stars we would! We booked a party here back in December and one today and both went amazing. All the staff is friendly and attentive, food was great all the kids loved it! We were even able to play with our kids if we wanted to which was very surprising! 3 hours was just enough time to let all the kids burn out their energy. I saw a few people say they’re expensive and if you’re comparing them to a free public park then sure, they are. But they make it stress free to have a kids bday party PLUS we didn't have to clean up afterwards, and that to me is worth every penny. We'll definitely be back.

Review: This place is wonderful. A little Spendy, I’ll be honest, but on a windy or rainy or too hot day with a bunch of pent up children this is the answer. The food is incredible the empanadas and tacos are out of this world so make sure you give the restaurant a try.

They treat you like family and I’ve never had a bad customer service experience.

Review: Only issue I have which gives it 3 stars is they allow kids greater than 36 inches in the less than 36 inches area. Which makes it tough when you have little ones specifically. I hope they start following thru more in this as it is advertised only 36 inches and under is allowed in this area. Just prepare yourself for kids not being watched by their parents too. $$$ too.

Other than this great local spot for kids to burn energy.

Review: Not really impressed! They have a lot of fun things for kids to do but 1/3 of the area is dedicated to 36 inches and under.  They will let you come in if you’re an adult and purchase their $4 socks.  They wouldn’t let my 13-year-old daughter go in with my four-year-old granddaughter to help her.
It’s worth $10 but not the $22 you pay plus $4.00 for socks. We brought her own slip resistant socks but apparently you have to purchase theirs.  They claim it’s a safety issue, but clearly it’s just to make more money.  I don’t think we’ll be back. I’d rather take my kids to Get Air or Quake for that money. The Rollarena and bowling is a fraction of the price and are just as much fun.   The employee checking us in, even proceeded to tell me that some of the other places that require their own socks, take away your socks that don’t belong to them.  Really??!!  Quake steals your personal purchases clothes??  Come on. I’d rather just about give anywhere else my business.

Review: I enjoy bringing my kids here but I really dislike how the “Tots” can play in the big kid area, it’s really unsafe having the two age groups mixed which is why I assume the big kids aren’t allowed in the toddler area. The tots need to be kept in their little area just how the big kids are expected to stay off to the other side in their area. I don’t want to babysit my big kids every move and make sure they don’t accidentally plow down some toddler that’s just run out in front of them because the toddler isn’t being watched. If the end goal here is safety then the littles shouldn’t be mixed in with the big kids.

In my opinion it is a tad over priced for the little ones under 36"", but well worth it if you stay the full 2 hours of playtime. From what i was told 1 and under play free.

You all did an amazing job. My only complaint, if that’s what you wanna call it, and I hate to even call it that because it’s not a complaint but that It was a little warm, but I guess with that many bodies running around having fun you will have that. Everyone that came with my party had a great time, and I have no doubt we will be back again. Thank you so much for a great time.

Review: Place is cool and everything BUT the place allow any adults with the necessary sock to claim up in the upper level inside the enclosed kids play area. sure these adult might be the parents of other kids BUT do you actually trust them in an enclosed area with your kids?
What's these adult background?  Or if they actually parents of any other kids? Some parents are actually distracted hard to notice anything.
Make your own decisions. I decided what goes on with my kids. And I'm not a big fan in the idea of having another MALE ADULTS sharing the enclosed Play area next to my kid.
Folks the dream land play ground is public, nothing fancy, but it's open and you actually can watch your kid without worrying about the kid is playing way up there in an enclosed area next to these adults.

Review: Recently had my daughters 6th birthday here. The facility was extremely hot and one of my partygoers ended up with an extreme heat rash and had to leave early. Every child was extremely red and overheated. The staff was rude and did not check on our party at all, outside of dropping off the food that we had to wait forever for. One staff member brought fries on accident, then came back and took them from the kids even though she informed us they were now going to be thrown away. I asked to leave them since they were getting tossed, and she said “sorry, I can’t, my boss is here” and left. Nobody brought us plates or a cake knife. We had to track somebody down each time and the cake knife was filthy.

Booking the party was a nightmare. Online says Fancy is on sale at 299. Online booking wouldn’t show the sale price so I called instead. First staff member told me it was not the Fancy party that was discounted but then apologized after viewing the website and realized they were wrong. They transferred me to a manager to book since the front was busy but the manager was short with me and rudely told me the sale price was “sold out”. She did not ask me any questions about the potential party. I booked online anyways and then inquired about it again at check out after the party. The staff member checking us out told me the sale price was available any day besides Saturday. Had I known that, I would have booked the party for a Sunday to get the almost $100 dollar discount. Why did the manager not explain this to me during that initial phone call? Why tell me it was sold out? Why not ask me which day I planned to have the party? The manager, Griselda, was unapproachable and rude over the phone during that initial phone call as well as during the party.

The owner was there and finally came out to talk to me. However, they lied and told me she wasn’t the owner and that the owner lives out of state. A quick internet search showed me she was the owner…it was very odd that they didn’t tell me the truth? She clearly did not care to rectify anything. She didn’t speak English so a staff member spoke to her for me about the situation. All she offered me was 40 dollars (gift card) for my next visit even though I paid close to 600 after everything. I wish I realized who she was while I was there still. Although it’s such a weird situation to pretend you’re not the owner!

The lack of professionalism, the terrible customer service, the lying, the heat that no one was willing to fix, the lack of accountability…the whole experience was so unforgivable. I’m so disappointed.

EDIT to respond to reply:
You guys had one other party going on while we were there. Every single person in there that day knew how hot it was. We heard numerous people complain outside our party and could visibly see most of the patrons sweating.
As for the booking, I called because I wasn’t going to sit and enter in different dates. I should be able to call and expect honesty, information, and great customer service. Your employees gave me three separate and conflicting responses and Griselda was terribly rude. You reviewing your software system means nothing and is not related to the situation. I was able to book, the discount wasn’t applying. I should have been told why and not that it “sold out” which wasn’t true.

I left that day defeated. Only reason I was somewhat calm and nice upon leaving, was because Jessie, your front desk employee, was great at handling things. As far as I knew, he’d done all he could do (this was before I knew he was also lying to me about who you were). I knew that outside of that, I was not going to get any more help and decided to email the owner. Although you were there the whole time but did not convey your true identity as owner and did not speak English. What else was I to do? The manager left. You are dishonest and I’m so disgusted at how you chose to handle this whole situation.

Why respond to this review but not my email? Your response here is misleading and isn’t even close to addressing everything.

I want my money back.

Review: They desperately need a policy of not letting sick kids into their establishment. One kid would not stop coughing the entire time and was very noticeably sick. Another kid was also doing the same thing and was coughing so hard that he eventually vomited all over the floor. Yes I get it, it is a kid play area and you can’t expect perfection. But this was a pretty easy call when you have two kids who are coughing so hard that they don’t stop. And shame on the parents for bringing them. But whatever. Sadly, this ruins the experience, and makes you not want to come back.

Review: The facility has potential but I could not justify the price. We paid $61 for my 1 year old and 6 year old to play for 2 hours. The place is heavily scented and has an overwhelming smell of something similar to strong laundry detergent. After 10 minutes I had trouble breathing and had to sit towards the back to get any type of relief. We’ve been to other indoor playgrounds for half the cost and they were cleaner without the heavy scents. I wouldn’t be able to return here for these reasons alone. Staff seemed friendly but I only encountered the 1 person at the front checking us in.

Review: We had a bad experience the first time. They reached out and made things right with us. We gave them a second try and were very happy with it. We will take the kids again, the love this place. Pleased with the customer service from management.

Review: My kids are 7 and we have been going here for a few years now. They love this place. I like that I can see them wherever they are. Its best when not busy but even then, they don't care.

Review: Good for the kids ages 5, 10, 12 they had a blast. Great place to come and let them loose. Simple waiver form to fill out other than that the price is alright.

Review: I haven't gone but the prices are insanity. Especially if you buy the membership it only discounts tickets 15%?
Edit: visited. Much smaller than the trampoline park. Above and below 36in have about half each of play area. I'm thinking it's not worth the price but kids loved it. Turns out you need socks that say iPlay on them which are 4$ a pair. It was mostly empt on a Thursday at 430. 5 total kids. I'm thinking it it was 16$ a child instead of 22$ we might come back.

Review: Went there with my 5 children one of which is a 16 almost 17 yr old boy who wasn't planning on going into any playground and just sit there with me while the little ones played. And they wouldn't let us in at all unless I paid for the older child to jist sit with me. Absolutely ridiculous no trust in there customers I assured them he wouldn't play in the playground they said was in there contract... I read contract and it said nothing about that. Then she said was policy... which one is it??? They just lost bi customers that pay a lot each time.

Review: The kids enjoy the spot. It's nice to have the wristbands so they can't leave without you. You are able to connect to wifi and get some work done as the kids enjoy some entertainment. There is food and drinks available as well. From parents who just want their kids to play or to (birthday or event) parties, there is fun for everyone. The staff is extremely helpful and always a pleasure to work with.

Review: We normally enjoy  Iplay but unfortunately we’re not pleased with the height restrictions for the smaller area. My sister came to visit from Berlin and my niece is newly 3 but very tall. Of course she wants to play with my average 2.5 year old in the little area. She’s about an inch and a half over the limit and although my 7 year old had previously been able to play gently in that area with siblings, she wasn’t allowed. I understand if she’s being very rough or if there’s a lot of kids but there was only 2 other families here with maybe a total of 8-10 kids. There was only 2 kids in that play section and the guy employee wouldn’t allow the very newly 3 year old in there. We pay more for the “taller”age and they can only be in this section but I also paid less for my 2 year and he gets access to everything? Doesn’t make sense and was really discouraging to see her denied the more fun kiddie toys for her age}","Washington","iplayexperience.us","Wheelchair accessible entrance","99336"
