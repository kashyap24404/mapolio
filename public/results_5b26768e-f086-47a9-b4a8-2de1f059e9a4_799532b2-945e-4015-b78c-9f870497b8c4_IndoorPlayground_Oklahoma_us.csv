Great place to go to when it’s too hot/cold/rainy outside. ⏎ The only thing that stops me from coming more often is the fact that they use plug in air fresheners which are absolutely terrible, especially for young kids.

From the moment we walk through the door, we’re always welcomed with open arms by the wonderful staff. The atmosphere is so warm and inviting that we instantly feel like part of the family every time we visit. The owner is incredibly kind and always takes the time to chat with us, making us feel valued and appreciated. ⏎  ⏎ The play area itself is fantastic—safe, clean, and filled with fun activities that keep my son entertained for hours. It's clear that a lot of thought goes into providing a space that kids can not only have fun but also learn and grow in. It’s also a great place for parents to relax while their little ones play, knowing that they’re in a safe, well-supervised environment. ⏎  ⏎ We always look forward to our visits and are so grateful for the positive energy and care the staff puts into making  Play haven such a special place.

I'm always greeted with a smile from the staff or the owner.  My grandson loves the ball pit best but plays with all different set ups there. They are always changing things up and it's always clean.

My wife had taken our kids here on numerous occasions and never had a problem. So naturally, we thought it would be a great place for our kids birthday party. I thought everything went great, we weren't early, left on time, followed all the rules, and cleaned up after ourselves. So much so, the employee there thanked us for cleaning so much as most people don't clean as well as we did. Then, TWO DAYS later and THREE OTHER PARTIES LATER, the owner texts my wife accusing us of damaging her property and leaving a massive sand mess there. Didn't ask us if we happened to notice anything, just straight up accused us of it and then banned us from coming back. As if we wanted to come back after such treatment and accusations. I thought this was such a nice place but I guess I was wrong. We were such loyal customers too, don't come here unless you want to be accused of something you didn't do and talked down too. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Lucia Smith ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: Play Haven Studio in Elgin is a great place for children and parents. The kids have fun with all the toys and the parents can work, play with their kids or even socialize with the other parents. The fact that you can have birthday parties and avoid the chaos at your own house is fantastic. Just be respectful of the place and everyone will have a blast. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tree Ofsunshine ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: I recently attended a birthday party at the Play Haven Studio in Elgin, OK. This was a birthday party for 5 year olds with the parents also attending. At the completion of our event the parents were meticulous about the cleanup. We even went as far as helping with the cleanup of the onsite toys. The lady working there also confirmed that everything looked fine. And yet, we were accused of moving the play structure and leaving sand. I know that 5 year olds are not capable of moving something of that size, so that leaves the adults. NO ONE moved the structure and NO ONE brought in sand. I know this because I was there and saw every single person that entered. I guess the owner did not take into account that there was a later party that same day and two parties on Sunday. We were treated very poorly by the owner of this establishment. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: M. Bravo ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: DO NOT GO HERE!!! We were treated terribly by the owner. ⏎  ⏎ I'm so upset right now. We had booked a party slot on 4/5/25 and we followed all the rules, we made sure all children followed the rules. Everyone was respectful. So it was shocking to be accused, 2 days later, of causing ""extensive"" damage. We were respectful of their equipment and the employee working there said everything looked great before we left. The owner also accused of there being sand everywhere because of us. Where would we get sand from?! ⏎  ⏎ Also, let me note that our party was early Saturday. They had a party after we left and two more parties the day after. There has been three parties since ours. ⏎  ⏎ The lady is a BAD business owner. She does not know how to value loyal customers. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: MacKenzie Rivers ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: A gem for Southwest Oklahoma.

I told her it was my first time here, and she was nice enough to explain things to me. The play area was clean and neat until the kids got into it. I love there’s a place for my one year old to play. She had such a blast! We have something similar in Altus but it is not age appropriate for her and was more for older children than toddlers. Will definitely be back with my friends, and it was definitely worth the trip. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Larissa Chaplain ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: We love this place!

It is such a great place for kiddos (and parents!!) to socialize/make friends and use their imagination.

This is by far the best one I’ve found. ⏎ Especially great for kids 5 and under. This is one of the safest layouts. It has 3 levels but no long straight “stairs” so that even if you’re little one were to tumble down them, it wouldn’t be too far and injury is unlikely. ⏎ They are one of the cleanest as well, you don’t see as much dust and grime in hard to clean places as you do at a lot of places. ⏎  ⏎ This place is also in great repair. Any time I see something torn up or broken, it is inevitably repaired by the next time I visit.

They have a sign where it’s a place for kids up to 12 years old to play, though I honestly think it’s better suited for kids between ages 1-10. The older ones might not get as much out of it. I’ve thrown a few birthday parties here for my kids, but their older cousins tend to get bored pretty quickly. That said, my kids absolutely love it (and so do I—at least for them!). The place is always kept really clean, and you’ll see staff walking around making sure everything’s in top shape. The bathrooms are also spotless and they have a diaper-changing station. Plus, they offer free coffee while you’re there, which is a nice touch. Snacks for the kids are available, and prices for entry and snacks aren’t too bad. One tip: definitely bring socks since they’re required, unless you want to shell out for a pair on-site. Parking can be tricky on weekends since it gets pretty crowded, but it’s worth it! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alex Martinez ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: I love taking my toddler to Kids City.

I get playing with your kids but it’s not them playing with their kids, it’s kids having to wait for the older people to move out of the way. With that being said, I still am giving five stars because the facility deserves it. The bathroom is just beautiful, probably cleaner than the one at even my house let alone a public place that caters to children. The staff is extremely friendly, the facility itself is very clean, lots of places for parents to sit, big enough to follow your toddler or small child through the play places. It’s is so much to be able to interact with the kids, meet other parents/grandparents/guardians and not have to be in the heat. It’s the only time my grandson gets to play with littles and it’s important to socialize your kids even at a young age. This place is incredible. We have been to one other place like this and this one is by far nicer and provides more to do. We will be back and have encouraged friends to take their littles there, too. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Angelica Leija ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Very good service and clean and good facilities. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Chelsea Hester ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: By far the cleanest indoor kid play place!

My 3 year old LOVED it and my 9 year old enjoyed it too.  I was able to join them as long as I had grippy socks (you can bring your own). They had an area in the front for your itsms but also once you past the gate there are plenty of tables where you can leave your stuff. The 0-5 have their own space but can also join the bigger playground area. I did notice some of the littles almost getting hurt if they ran under the monkey bar area though. They have free coffee for adults. And a snack shop with reasonable prices. It was very clean and service was great !

The owner also made sure I got all the excess socks of the kids that didnt show since we paid for 12 kids which I appreciated. Definitely recommend throwing a party here. ⏎  ⏎ We came here a few days ago and my kids are still raving and begging to go back. The staff was all very friendly and all smiles which was nice. There was plenty of seating for parents and lots of snack & drink options. The play area is the biggest, nicest one we have seen out of all indoor playgrounds in the city. It is so well done and they are constantly walking around cleaning and ensuring kids aren't climbing slides etc. My oldest decided he wants his party here so we just booked today and are looking forward to a birthday experience here! We would 100% recommend this playground to everyone, even younger ones. They have a 5 & under area which is the most impressive I've seen as well. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Christina “Ciicii” Prisch ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jeremy Gaines ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Galyn Hembree ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: We loved this place!

When we arrived, we were informed that we needed to either remove our shoes or wear shoe covers. The woman at the front desk was about to provide us with shoe covers, but the manager or owner intervened and directed her not to, instead offering us socks. Although I was uncomfortable with the idea of taking off my shoes, I complied with his request. ⏎ The situation became even more troubling when we chose a seat right by the entrance. We noticed that the same manager gave shoe covers to a caucasian woman and her daughter who had just arrived. This raised immediate questions for me—why were they given shoe covers while we were not? The manager had previously warned us that the shoe covers could be slippery and dangerous, yet he still chose to provide them to an older caucasian woman, who was over 70. ⏎ This behavior not only felt discriminatory but also left me feeling uneasy. It made me question his intentions: Did he not want us to have the shoe covers, or was he recklessly indifferent to the safety of the older woman? It’s disheartening to experience such a stark difference in treatment based on race, and it has left a lasting negative impression on our visit. ⏎  ⏎ He might attempt to defend himself by saying, ""I'm not racist; I have minorities working for me."" but it won’t work. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: James Pinwheel ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: Great cozy place to take my kids.

Remember this is not about parents comfort. It’s about the kids. It now forces all the kids into the main play area and it’s beginning to feel very overcrowded, which was the main reason I enjoyed coming here was because it wasn’t like some of the other indoor play areas where it was overcrowded.

Massage chairs that you can use for a fee. Parents can play with their kids or bring a book to read while the children play. I really don’t have any complaints. I do wish the entry was a tad bit bigger bc on cold days you do have to stand outside the door if there are a ton of people in front of you. Other than that it’s a fantastic place!!

I took it to my husband for us to discuss if the membership (that we’ve had before) would be worth it for our family due to their policies and our specific dietary needs. We decided that, even though it’s inconvenient for us and we didn’t like the comments from the staff that day, we’d try purchasing a membership and see how it went from there.

They do have snacks provided and you can order in pizza to be delivered. You can also eat that pizza inside the facility. BUT  you can not bring in food or eat outside in the car and reenter. ⏎  ⏎ I’ve been doing “car picnics” with my oldest when we come here once she was off baby food. I did not understand their policy (and quite frankly do not agree with it) so once we came back in to do our last 30 mins of time we were informed about the policy and that we would have to repay. ⏎  ⏎ My kids were loudly upset/crying. Sure, not the funnest thing to hear, but hey.. they are kids that just got told focus on your food so we can go play and now you can’t go play. ⏎  ⏎ Welp, the staff decided that it was ridiculous that my children were upset and chose to talk about them in a very unprofessional and distasteful way. Including the manager. I had forgotten my coffee with all the chaos of trying to leave, so that was awesome to walk into. ⏎  ⏎ Ive spent a lot of money here.. my kids enjoy the play place, the owner seems kind.. but the food policy is wack and is completely unaccommodating to children that can’t eat pizza and I also won’t involve myself with staff that will talk negatively about me or my children. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Daniel AutomotiveMD ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Breana Bradley ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you!! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Linda Shrum ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you, Linda. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Melanie Howell ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: My kids are obsessed with all the different things to do!

If you have younger (or smaller) children like I do, you really have to watch them at all times, which can be hard considering it is a pretty large place.  My kids have gotten cornered and pushed, and it's usually by much larger kids.  I understand you are responsible for your kids, but if you don't want to deal with larger kids picking on your little ones, don't bother going.  I will say it is very clean though. ⏎  ⏎ Edit since I can't reply to the owner's response: ⏎  ⏎ I appreciate your response to my feedback today.  I want to emphasize how much I've loved the opportunity to be one of those parents who gets to play with my children at your facility.  If you go back and review camera footage from all the times we've been there, I'm usually getting to play with them.  We love going down the slides together, and I love going to the places I can fit in, haha. Today was not one of those days.  I was working on an assignment from school, but if you watch the footage, you can see that I looked up frequently (way more than the verbal check-ins require) to check on my children.  I've seen them get shoved around by bigger kids frequently, and I have never brought it to your attention because I saw it as an opportunity for them to learn how to handle conflict.  When the boys approached me with any issues, I would say that they can either use their words or walk away.  They usually do really well.  When I was called up there and you let me know what happened, I was shocked.  My son has never reacted that way before.  I wasn't exactly given an option to figure out what happened, you said ""when this happens, we request that you stay with them  or leave.""  Had I known the other child was 9 years old (both twice my son's age and size) and that he wouldn't let my son out of the foam pit and that he and his sister had been picking on him before that, I would have mentioned something to you.  I have been working with my boys to teach them how to handle conflict on their own.  You even mentioned yourself in your response to my review that you get frustrated that other people do not supervise their children, but it's your business...what is stopping you from doing more to force parents to do that?  Regardless of whether Breakaway is a licensed childcare facility or not, an establishment that caters to children has a duty to ensure their safety and well-being.  While I understand that busy days present challenges, it is not an excuse.  You can lower the capacity threshold if this is an issue, right?  Moving forward, I would just earnestly request you to reconsider your approach to addressing these issues. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Chy S ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: We love Breakaway!!

The front desk person was polite but completely unhelpful. ⏎  ⏎ I understand this review isn't applicable for everyone, but for our family it's a +30 minute drive to come here and a $26 entry fee, so between that and the gas it's a bit of a deal breaker.

He absolutely loves it. We've been to other indoor playgrounds and while they're all welcomed parents to play on the equipment with their kids, this is the only one that actually seems to have been built to accommodate parents. It's much easier and more comfortable for adults to navigate. There are plenty of seats for parents as well including couches and snacks that can be purchased. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Gemini Tayy ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you, Taylor! :) ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Heaven Clark ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: So much fun and staff was so kind! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: mallie Dickerson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you so much, Mallie! :) ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mercedes Hamilton ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Why is their 3 people sitting at the desk if only one can help . ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Gracie Richardson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you, Gracie! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Priscilla Evans ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for the 5 star, Priscilla! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mary Redwine ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 3 months ago ⏎ Review: We had our daughters birthday party here, and it was absolutely amazing!!!

They told me 13.00! I said last time it was 11.00 they just stood there and stared at me! Two young girls. I said well I guess I will have to leave then because all  I have is 11.00 they said sorry. I decided to call my husband to come back all the way here to bring me 3.00 . I told them he would be here soon and they made my 20 month old and I wait inside the gated area for 12 minutes geezers! Instead of letting us inside ! The girls were whispering back and forth.  I will never ever step foot back in this place again!

I went here for a birthday party and the two teenage girls in the front checking people in are rude, They need training in customer service. I also observed how they treated other party attendees and they were rude to them as well. I believe they said they would call the police on a lady and she was just standing there talking to other party goers. From my observation they seem to have a problem with people of color. This was my last time supporting this place I've been here before and everytime those two are there they give me a hard time. I will spend my hard earned money where my business is wanted. Besides the rude customer service the kids enjoy themselves. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Hannah Fleming ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for the 5 star review, Hannah! :D ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mustang Creek PTO ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Michelle Ross ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Super fun place to take your littles!!

We had them booked for a fourth, but our daughter got very sick..  Understandably, they have a penalty for rebooking on a different date, but they took our deposit instead.  We had a reschedule expecting a small loss in the deposit (penalty as the website says), but they ended up taking our deposit.  What's the incentive now for rebooking if we lose the same money as someone who completely cancels?  We spoke to the employee there about our disagreement with the decision and the owner was there reinforcing the decision.  I think this is bad practice and their policy is unclear and ambiguous.  No consideration for loyalty to the business with three previous bookings.  If we could have rebooked with a partial loss of the deposit we would have been fine with it.  We won't be booking any more birthdays here unfortunately. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Rob Robb ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: Very place had a great birthday party there.

He did, until he wound up being harmed by a bully. Coincidently neither that child's parent nor any staff was around. I observed the incident from across the way. Now I had been watched the whole time I was there. I realized it was because we were the only ones there who did not look like everyone else.  In fact, the Manager had approached me at one point and asked me if we were leaving prior to this incident, and I said no. (Never figured out why he would ask that.) Later I thought, well, maybe it was a hint and we should have left then. I let the child and the parent (who told me I was ignorant because I did not want to speak with him) know that the bullying was unacceptable behavior. I assured the manager that that we would not ever return. I feel they probably prefer that certain people not patronize their business anyway. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Becky Lewis ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: This location is my fave of all of the indoor play places!!

There used to be a whole side of things to do besides the ball pit and slide and now there is just a linear swing line where kids go back and forth. The price hasn’t changed and a lot of the soft mats have tape applied to them and the trampolines are sagging. It needs a refresh and maintenance.

The lady at front was super helpful and the staff was really sweet but I feel like more should be done for making sure children are safe. It’s clear that parents do not pay the slightest attention to their kids here. There were a group of kids throwing objects at other kids faces and after confronting the mom, she did nothing but sit there while her children still continued to throw toys and balls at other kids faces. It’s definitely not the staffs job to parent or control other people’s kids but there should be some sort of protocol for removing children if they aren’t being nice to others or at least make the smaller area for smaller children only. It was disgusting watching older toddlers throwing objects at infant faces and nothing was done. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Nicole Adams ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Had my daughters birthday party here.

We love the play pit and what they have to offer the kiddos in our community. The only reason I didn’t give five stars was because I wish the hours were later in the evenings. My husband and I work opposite shifts and we would utilize the membership more if we had later hours. Not many kids are there to socialize with during school hours and shift changing at 5:30pm doesn’t allow much play time. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Joseph Levine ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kalee Morgan ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: Loved it, my son loved it, was a nice clean Environment & the staff were amazing too!

The Play Pit was a pleasant surprise and my 4 year old loved it. We bought a one month membership and went a few times each week. It's very clean compared to some other play cafes we've visited. I saw the employees vacuuming, taking the trash out, and checking the bathrooms regularly. All of the employees were very kind and friendly. Even the other parents were wonderful and handled little kid disagreements/rowdiness very well. ⏎  ⏎ On top of that, it was a great place to get some work done while my little one played. Comfy seats, fast internet, and we were able to bring in our lunch.

Today I had to complain twice to an employee about a group of bigger kids harassing my son. They punched him in the stomach a couple times and I mentioned it and asked how I should handle it - to which she said she had already had to talk to the father once. Then it happened again my son ran up to me holding his head and nose because they hit him again. I talked to the father after that time and he talked to the boy. Then I heard my son yelling so went to see and they had chased him again and he said they spit at him and were chasing him. We decided to leave after that because he was too worried to even play and I was on edge. I don’t feel it was fair that we left because my son was uncomfortable when there was no repercussion for the older kids. I was told the cut off age is 12 but that seems much too old considering the majority is 3-6 it seems and some of these kids were twice his size. I hate to leave a negative review because we do love coming here but I feel that something else should have been done. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: K R ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: The Play Pit is Norman's only indoor playground and does it so well! 🤗 ⏎  ⏎ Being in a kid-centered environment can be a bit uncomfortable and overwhelming after a while. Still, the Play Pit's cozy antique rocking chairs and furniture, complemented by the modern-chic aesthetic, make you feel like you brought your kids over to your cute friend's house to play. It's as cozy and comfortable for adults as it is entertaining for their kids. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 ⏎  ⏎ The historic architecture enchants your visual sense, and it is such a great example of adaptive reuse with what would feel like a contradiction in housing a playground, but it fits oh-so-well. We are used to traveling an hour to Edmond for a similar center, and although Edmond's is larger, the aesthetic at the Play Pit appeals to the adults more and makes it a comfy place to hang out and not feel like you are surrounded by raging children. 😌 ⏎  ⏎ The staff is friendly, and it always smells fresh in there. On more than one occasion, I have witnessed them actively cleaning surfaces and the air with Lysol and other anti-bac/viral products. ⏎  ⏎ Finally, with the price of $13 for the first kid and $10 for additional kids and re-entry allowed, it makes for a fun family experience you can feel good about! 🙌🥳 They also offer monthly passes, birthday parties, and private parties. ⏎  ⏎ Last, but not least they offer an assortment of snacks and coffee for sale, in addition to bringing your own food if you keep it out of the playground areas. 🛝 ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tahrima Binte Rouf ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Navil Cervantes ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Great place to take the kids to let out their energy!

If my children were at fault, the staff should have been notified.

The first time we had nothing but good things to say, but after this last party we left feeling very dissapointed at the way we were treated. We very much felt like inferior guests and undervalued customers. When we arrived for our kids party there was a sign on the door saying they were closing early for a private party. Well…part of the draw to this facility is that after your allotted party time, your guests can stay and play as long as they want. Instead we were rushed out. When talking to the manager she claimed that she called us, yet neither my husband nor I have any calls or voicemails from the playbox. She offered to give us a couple passes for free play, but we felt this warranted bigger measures as this was our child’s birthday that was cut short unknowingly to us who paid a lot of money for our guests to continue to stay and play. 2 free play passes does nothing, how about making it right? It was embarrassing, even our guests were upset. It takes a lot for us to complain and I understand mistakes happen but there was no compassion or understanding for our frustrations from the staff, only a lack of accountability. In the future, if private parties are booked and there are previously booked parties shortly before, the staff should confirm with the surrounding parties and if people are unhappy, then they should be allowed to back out of their reservation and book their child’s special day at a facility that will be equally accommodating. Please keep in mind before booking your kids special day here, that their day can be cut short without your knowledge in order to accommodate a private party who will provide more money to the business. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Lorna Pickett ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: Took my grandkids here right before school restarted.

This one in Mustang has a center section that kids can run through, but it is small, and is only 2 levels. It is short, so adults can't really go through it with the children. Around the center structure are other play areas. There is a fire station with nothing in it. There is a school room with nothing in it. By nothing, I mean 3 walls, and nothing even on the walls. There is a market with a few groceries, 2 carts, a cash register, and, inexplicably, a toy oven. There are no pots and pans or cooking utensils. There is a section in the back with toys for little ones. There is a food truck that has no play food or drinks or anything else that came with it out of the box. There is another kitchen with no items to play with it. It makes no sense. Why have these things? They just made my grandchildren wander around, looking for the missing ingredient to this place, which is fun. There is an awful lot of fun missing.

We arrived at 4:00pm to have a couple hours and bought all of our kiddos a ""Day Pass"". After 30-35mins of play time a staff member announced over the intercom that they were closing in 25mins (5:00pm) despite that they officially close at 6:00pm. Being confused I asked what was going on and was told that they had a private event and they needed the hour to clean. This made our family very upset because we were NEVER told that we're going to have to leave in a hour after getting there and paying around $75. When I stated this to the older woman behind the counter she told me there was a sign on the door explaining about the event. We read the main sign on the door when we first arrived and the sign she was talking about was NOT there . The lady had ZERO care, and wasn't concerned when I told her we were never told about this event because WE WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A ""DAY PASS"" FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS THAT LASTED ONLY A HOUR. She pretty much blew us off as if it was our fault and that it wasnt an issue we werent warned about the event. Multiple families we spoke to walking by afterward were also NEVER told about the private event and were quite upset as well. This issue was 100% avoidable, and/or at the very least been told by the staff that they were sorry showing a little sliver of remorse. In the end we felt as if we got scammed!

The facility was great for the kids but for mom & dad, it was stressful. ⏎ For starters, right off the back, I was not informed you had to pay a fee to bring in your own drinks until we were bringing in water & lemonade. Per the party pack, it only mentioned food. ⏎ Secondly, having absolutely no time to set up was ridiculous. When mom & dad finally got everything set up, it was time to eat do cake and presents so we could be out of there in time for the next party. ⏎ Third, once again, the party package only mentions additional charge per kid. No where does it mention an extra charge for adults so when we invited everyone, we were unaware we would be charged for them. Again, found this out while I was there. Then I was informed the extra adults would be charged a lower price than what we were actually charged! ⏎ Fourth thing, I told them two or three times I wanted large pizzas. Somehow I still was brought XL & charged for XL. ⏎ Lastly, I didn’t love having someone bothering me the whole time. I was told I was over 3 kids & I absolutely knew I wasn’t, so I spent half my time trying to do a headcount to see what kid I was missing just for them to realize I was only 1 over, which I had told them over the phone earlier in the week, I would be. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mohammad Hassaan Khan ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Had our kids first birthday party in town over here and was a very good experience.

I was left with one week to prepare another venue last minute, and when i contacted them about getting my deposit refunded they stated they had attempted to call me multiple times. My phone number was never provided, nor did i even have any missed calls from their phone number, or any number leaving a voice mail claiming to be them. i did get refunded, but it was just absolutely unprofessional. the whole situation. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kenneth Halstied ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Wonderful place to take your kids!

Was offered $2 off prior to entering (per kid) to give a five star review. I took the deal, but am following up with my true review, instead of my bought one. ⏎  ⏎ Took my 4 and 1 year old here on a Saturday because my oldest had been asking to go (she had been before with an aunt, this was my first time). The space itself it very large, but a lot of it seems wasted. The play gym is okay, mostly places to crawl around. There are two slides, which were just okay. One enters to a ball pit, but the slide stops the kids before they get to the so-so filled pit. (The balls also bunch in the corner). An attendant at other kids’ gyms is there to push the balls back. I will say the toddler area was great. A smaller slide with a ball pit and things for little movers to crawl around; however apparently the older kids thought it was cool too… so we couldn’t really enjoy the space. ⏎  ⏎ Security/children check out is better at other places. And there were some children climbing ON TOP of the structure, which an employee (or parent for that matter)  wasn’t around to correct. ⏎  ⏎ After all while my older was done with the gym and just wanted to play the arcade games (which I had heard from aunt was probably what was going to happen). My husband bought a play card. Can you guess what the minimum dollar amount was for a card. $25! Wuuut. I was guessing $5-$10. $25 seems a little desperate (in addition for bribing for reviews). I suppose it’s nice you can use that money for games AND concessions… but we couldn’t get the card to swipe on a lot of games and some of the rides were broken. 😐 ⏎  ⏎ Overall for value, entertainment, and safety I think the place is just okay. For me it’s ranked three out of the four I’ve tried in the area. I have not yet been to We Rock the Spectrum.  I think the next time my kiddo starts asking to go here, I’ll just take her to an arcade… ⏎  ⏎ Money spent was $24.55 for admission for two kids and two adults (after $4 off) and $25.00 game/concession card. For 2 hours of play. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tyler Goldsborough ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Great place to bring the kids when it is to hot to play outside ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Josh ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: We like this place and have had both our kids birthday parties here. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Eliran Tch ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jackson Matthews ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Best kids place! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kyle Caldwell ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Austin McClune ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Margaret Moore ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Loved this place, my great nephews birthday party was there.

It smelled clean, it felt clean, it was awesome. Best I’ve seen it. I was thoroughly impressed. The employees were constantly busy cleaning if they weren’t helping families.  I never saw anyone just standing around. Outstanding.

Bubba is AWESOME.  My 4 and 7 year old both run around for HOURS, and have a blast.  I like that there are multiple seating options for the parents (though having tables that don’t rock would be a huge plus), and that parents can play as well.  The security checkpoint at the exit is amazing- you aren’t leaving with kids who don’t match your code! ⏎  ⏎ The staff are always doing something- checking people in, cleaning, putting balls back.  They are friendly and helpful. Bathrooms are clean (HUGE perk to a kids Playzone), snacks are available and fairly priced. ⏎  ⏎ This place is perfect for when I need a few hours to get some stuff done, or just want to read while my kids run out their crazies.

Anyone in child safety knows the choking hazard of balloons, so why risk it?! I found evidence of white balloons, leading me to believe they have not cleaned up the play pits in awhile. I asked a staff member, and she replied they were cleaning. Been here over an hour and see no one cleaning. Also, there are too many blind spots with no staff watching out.

They Courtney the property manager is always nice, welcoming and ready to answer any and all questions. She takes the security serious so don’t lose those stickers and more importantly your kids. They also started having employees there to facilitate the slides and to make sure people are safe. The ball vacuums are broken and have been for some time and but it’s still a hit for the toddlers to just hold the button down.

We got 5 capri suns and 4 waters. That’s IT. No one knew or cared that we had ordered food. I will never book here again, totally pointless. We had family from out of town who came expecting food and we had nothing- not even an apology from the staff for completely f’ing up. We were not even given the time we paid for- they were 15 minutes late into cleaning the room, we had to set up, didn’t get our food and barely drinks, plus we were expected to leave out of the room, even though they did not give us the time we had PAID for. We should have gotten the 15 minutes they had taken out of the time we had originally. UNPROFESSIONAL! Don’t waste your time, please take your business to Breakaway Indoor playground in Edmond! Parking is better, staff is better and actually present so your children don’t get hurt, and their equipment isn’t breaking. ⏎  ⏎ Also it is policy you place orders upon arrival- no one asked us what we ordered and I presented it three times to four staff members. The staff doesn’t even follow policy. The manager, courtney, will argue with you and explain to you why it’s anyone fault but theirs! She will block you on Facebook so you can’t make a Facebook review, they will lie on all the reviews you make and they won’t get back with you when you ask to speak to someone higher up. They even came and found me while I was playing with my son to make sure we “didn’t leave without paying.” Unprofessional in many ways, but how could I possibly leave without paying if they’re supposed to be a check-in and check-out facility FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN?! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Rose Caesar ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: 😁🎭☯️ … ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Nathan Ortiz ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: The Playplace is big and open with lots to do, my kids always have a blast playing here and it’s one of the only places where they will go off by themselves and not need me to make it funner for them lol!

They found every other kids socks but not mine, so we had to buy new ones.  Other then that they were busy playing card games and doing their own thing.  For me and the needs of my kids it is a great place to keep them entertained so my husband and I could tag team christmas shopping.  I wouldn't go here for any other reason.

There’s a ball pit with a volcano that shoots the balls out of the top. They have their own bathrooms. The ball pit needs more balls, there’s not nearly as many as there used to be and a fair amount are crushed. The air cannons on the top level need a better way to get the foam balls up there.

My issue is the price being $15 a kid. I know its for 3 hours but I honestly can say I've only stayed about an hour each time.

The price for play used to be $10. I don’t think the cost is worth it. The toys are dated and cheap, even the music is some off brand music. They haven’t updated to warrant this increase at all imo. I am not the only one, other parents in line yesterday also seemed a bit shocked at the price jump. Hopefully it is just temporary, because I can’t justify that anymore. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jodie Skabronski ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Michelle Carder ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: You say you are wheelchair accessible and that is a lie!!! Your area you have for the parents to sit to watch their children is a tight fit even for someone who has 2 legs. You should really rethink the design of the seating and saying it's wheelchair accessible. Someone with crutches would have a hard time getting passed others to even get to the bathrooms to help the child. If my child was to get stuck up there I have no way of getting him down or even knowing because I can't see from the entrance. You don't want me to drop my child off but give me very limited option to watch my child.

I thought everything went great, we weren't early, left on time, followed all the rules, and cleaned up after ourselves. So much so, the employee there thanked us for cleaning so much as most people don't clean as well as we did. Then, TWO DAYS later and THREE OTHER PARTIES LATER, the owner texts my wife accusing us of damaging her property and leaving a massive sand mess there. Didn't ask us if we happened to notice anything, just straight up accused us of it and then banned us from coming back. As if we wanted to come back after such treatment and accusations.

We even went as far as helping with the cleanup of the onsite toys. The lady working there also confirmed that everything looked fine. And yet, we were accused of moving the play structure and leaving sand. I know that 5 year olds are not capable of moving something of that size, so that leaves the adults. NO ONE moved the structure and NO ONE brought in sand. I know this because I was there and saw every single person that entered.

My son was excited to paint a gift for his dad for father's day. However, from the moment we walked in the tension in air was ugh, why are here kinda feeling. My son dropped a mug that I had to pay half of. Which wasn't a big deal,  but the fact my son wasn't sure what he was supposed to do after picking out his gift, leading to him nervously dropping the cup. This was our first time here, and I literally had to prompt all conversation with the young lady working today. If your shy I get it, but the fact that I approached the desk and you are on phone tells me all I need to know. This place literally has a giant playground in it, and seems to be a place for kids. However, the young lady didn't seem to be very happy kids where there. She didn't engage much with my son, and was just very put off by having to help more than handing us a tray with paint on it. I just wish this would have been more of fun experience with my boys, instead it became a super akward moment, and not fun memories. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Constance Blair ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Dahlten Sweat ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: Such a fun place to take the kids and get creative ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Cameron Shurtz ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: Pretty cool place especially for a young kids birthday or special occasion.

I have a two year old and seven month old. The two year old did a bit of painting and played on the jungle gym, she wanted to do the pottery but it’s a bit too advanced for her age so I would bring her in a bit older. My seven month old had barely anything to do so that kind of sucked, there isn’t a mat or area where little ones can crawl and explore. I also saw a lot of dust bunnies and dirtiness around all areas, that was not so great. But the staff were nice. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Karen Mata ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Great fun place. We lo e painting the ceramics.

The kids had fun. There was even a senior citizen in there getting some paint time so it can be enjoyed by all. The gals working there were great and the play place was very clean. Even my teenagers liked it. The ONLY two issues i had was 1. there is a wall of boxes right next to the front door which really takes away from the asthetic of the place. It ruined the vibe a bit and appeared sloppy. 2. This place has very very tall industrial cielings, so if you lose an inflated balloon, they charge an astronomical amount of money. My advice to the owner is if losing balloons is an issue, use the money charged from other people to place a net over the private party areas at least so that its less of a stress. What is a little kids bday party without balloons? But my daughter STRESSED about ANY CHILD possibly touching the balloons on the table. Mind you, this was a 4 year olds bday party. Seems like a HUGE hassle over something that can be helped. She shouldnt have had to worry about a silly thing like balloons. She paid a decent amount for that space... she shouldnt be worried about stupid things like a lost 250$ balloon. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kristi Shanks ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: This place was great...

And the fact that I was told to just go through all the mixed ones to find good ones then let them know what I needed? Wow. Then the brushes were cut up. To top it off the ladies seemed very annoyed that I asked for a bag for my clay items, and that I had asked for glitter that was advertised to be included in a kit.

I've only ordered the pizza and wings, which are pretty good for a kids' place. I'm not sure about the other food items.

It got way too crowded. It looks clean but it stinks. We were ready to go and the girl checking the stamps to get out was the same doing the prizes. In the beginning I felt bad for her and was patient, I was in line and I know she saw me and my kids, but then decided to help the lady and kids behind me. I raised my hand to let her know we were first and all she did was to mock me. When she got close to me finally I was able to ask her nicely if she could check my kids points inside the cards, she seemed upset and just nodded. After that she was talking to people getting out of the place just not paying attention to any of us trying to get the prizes. At the end we decided to leave and not even try since she was so busy and was rude to us not once but 3 times. I understand she was busy but she didn’t even try, she didn’t keep up, and she didn’t care. And when we were getting out she didn’t even bother to ask for the stamps in our hands, she was too busy chatting with another couple. It was a good experience, my kids had fun, until this. Please hire more people. You could tell this girl hated being there. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kara Walton ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Wow! This place was so impressive, from the price, to the play structure itself, to even the food! I’m from Colorado and a place similar to this (Kids Empire) is $20 a child starting at age 1. Paying $6 for a 2 year old and two adults left us money to play the arcade games instead of fighting our toddler to stay away from them. When it came time for lunch we checked out the food counter expecting nothing better than Chuck E Cheese, but wow were we impressed. The pizza actually tasted good, the fried pickles were crispy and perfectly breaded, and the condiment station had everything we needed. I’m so sad we are leaving to go back home because we would be here several times a week otherwise. As it stands, Kid Mania fulfilled its purpose of tiring out our adhd 2 year old so we can start out 12 hour drive before nightfall. You can guarantee I’ll be back if we find ourselves in Ft Worth again, my husband will insist since he had as much fun as our son. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Dora Garcia ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: So much fun for kids. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Steven Evans ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: My kids love it here I'm sure yours will too ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Carolyn Farrell ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sally Ngugi ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Aree Handy ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Amazing active atmosphere for kids!

The employee who check us in barked at us to do waivers and was just generally in a foul mood. Then she griped at us that we had to pay for our toddler, who is under the age of two and I didn't realize he wouldn't be free. The tunnels had a smell to them, like throw up that wasn't properly bleached. Had to pay to get my toddler in, yet he could only play in a very small area that also smelled and had gum and candy stuck to it. There weren't any employees keeping track of where the older kids were playing, so older kids kept coming into the area that was specifically for 3 and under, which is a safety hazard. Most places would let a child under two in for free; I don't mind paying for my toddler if there is a special area for toddlers, but I need to know that the area is going to be safe for my child. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Stefany Granger ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Long lines to get in because they don't want to hire more help. Games for tickets often rip you off saying you won 40 tickets but you actually only get 20. Many of the games and kiddie rides are broken everytime we visit with our family.

It is like a chuck e cheese with a giant climbing play gym. They have the little rides for babies and toddlers, a climbing area for toddlers, and a climbing area for big kids, but it is all attached. Yes, adults can climb in, too! There is an adult quiet area upstairs, which is great, and more arcade games upstairs for adults and bigger kids. It is 12.99 for kids 3-12, and adults are $1. I would not recommend relying on the stamp security system they have because when we walked out with our 3 year old, they only checked his arm and not ours.

Half of the building is pretty much an entire obstacle like course that has a ton of mini activities within including; swings, slides, among other activities within. I have been here when it is super busy and just recently when there wasn't hardly anyone there. When it's crowded it can be a bit overwhelming, just a warning. There is a smaller portion of the obstacke area that is meant only for toddlers so they dont get ran over by the bigger kids and adults can go in all areas of the obstacle course. Socks are REQUIRED, they do have socks you can buy but ofcourse are gonna be more expensive than what youd get from a typical store, so keep that in mind. Luckily they will mark you and anyone else you come in with a numbered stamp so that nobody else can leave with your children and there is in fact a loud alarm for anyone that tries to leave without being let out by an employee. There is an upstairs area that has a more enclosed room for parents to watch over the little ones as well as a small arcade that can be used with their kids mania card you can get from a machine. There is food and drinks and you can't bring in your own but I so far haven't seen any issues with bring in a birthday cake [whether you have bought a birthday event package] of your own but not sure if that is per what employee is working or not, so take it with a grain of salt.  I haven't gone to the restroom here so unsure of the state it's in, sorry. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Yara O.P. ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: This park is excellent for taking the kids to have fun indoors. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Topher B. ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Lots of fun for kiddos and plenty of sitting area for adults all at a reasonable price. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kevin Luker ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Love this place, take my kids here all the time!

However, I do wish that staff monitored the jungle gym better. Today, my 3 yr old was trampled by about 7 children in the tunnel right above the check in/prize counter. One right after the other. He would try to get up and the next one would trample right on top of him. I saw the entire scenario go down and had to yell “WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!” Thankfully one of the older children in the jungle gym nearby heard me and pulled him to safety. She had to physically pull him out from under the other kids. He was crying and screaming. He could have been very seriously injured. The young lady working behind the counter saw the entire thing as well, and said not one word. During our time there today,  an employee came over the speaker system to tell kids not to climb up the slide on multiple occasions, and made reminders about wearing socks. If they can see that a child doesn’t have socks on and that children are climbing up the slide, they also have the ability to monitor rough play. I understand that sometimes situations like this just aren’t preventable, and kids will be kids. I’m not sure if it’s possible, but it would not be a bad idea for staff to be positioned throughout the jungle gym for an extra set of eyes to prevent issues like today. I know that waivers are required for each kid, but if the wrong family with the right connections and resources has a child that gets trampled, Kid Mania may find themselves liable after all. My nephew was injured at this location a few years back for the same reason. ⏎  ⏎ If you have small children, I would recommend Cheeky Monkeys or Adventure Kids Playcare. There is a section for children 3 and under at this location, but there are always children in that section that are absolutely over the age of 3, and they’re never made to leave the section. If I had not seen the situation go down today and yelled, my child could have been really hurt. If you absolutely must go here and you have a child under the age of about 5, I would recommend you enter the jungle gym with them, or make sure they’re accompanied by an older sibling or friend. The jungle gym is simply too big and as a parent, you cannot get to them fast enough in an emergency. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Allen Staley ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Hi Allen, ⏎ Thank You for the Review! ⏎ Come again soon! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Teresa West ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Perfect fun location for a child's birthday party.

Ultimately we had fun, but there were a few sections of the playground that felt a little dangerous for smaller children especially when it was crowded (even with me watching closely.)

I believe this location is new; it was certainly new to us and I’m so glad they are here because we need more indoor play places near Columbus. Funtastic is an indoor play place good for ages 1 (infant crawlers and even new walkers) through 12 and has areas sectioned off according to age. One of the selling points for us is how open the play area is so you can almost easily spot out your kids no matter where you were seated (another win, some places we have been to don’t have the kind of set up to easily supervise your kids). We just happened to not only be there at opening time but at a good time where there wasn’t too many kids there to play so space to play/run around was good. The facility was clean (this includes even the restroom) AND well lit so another win. Again we were there shortly after the play area was open for the day but we saw staff actively clean/sanitize when they could. Towards the end of the time (90 minute play time per play pass) we were reminded we could also extend our time if need be which is enforced based on the color wristband we were given at the beginning. I had to point out to the staff (who were not only helpful, they were polite and professional) I really appreciate that system. We will certainly be back when we are in the area. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alexis Marshall ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Funtastic was so fun, my kids talked about it the entire night and can not wait to go again!

There is so much for the kids to do. There is separate play areas for the smaller kids. The large party room had plenty of seating for 20 kids and lots of adults. Our party host and all of the employees were very helpful. ⏎  ⏎ They made planning this party so easy. They provide a link to send with the invites. As people register and complete the waiver, you get an email with an updated guest list. The party planner called and emailed several times to answer my questions and offer assistance. It is a little more expensive than some of our other options, but pizza and drinks are included so it works out to be better and easier. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Marta Harrison ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: I LOVE that we have a place like this in Auburn!

Lots for him to him do. I would say the place is good for 9 and under. As of 10/11/2024 it's 250 for two hours, 15 kids, if any kids are added it's a additional 5 dollars per child. You can arrive 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after to clean up party room.       Cons. I asked the owner if she could turn on the music, she told me it was already on, which I believe her, but it was so low, that even she had stop breathing to hear it. I didn't push the issue, but she could have turned up at least one or notches, I feel like that made the atmosphere feel dry. Then towards the end. I'm not forsure if she was just over the party or what, but she definitely reminded me that it's the last 30 minutes and I should have my GUEST start cleaning the play area before we go back to the party room. I have never been to place, that asks you to do that, Mind you most of the party was littles. That is wasting the time that I paid for, I would have happily picked up after but, definitely not during. My guest or there parents shouldn't have to worry about that. I chose not to make my guest clean up and I told everyone to go back to the party room. That gave us guest enough time for cake, pizza, and presents. The party ended right on time giving us the 30 minutes allotted for the clean up. My older kids and the few stranglers at the end would have cleaned, but her and her husband already cleaned up the play area. All in all, it is a fun place for the kids to burn off the extra energy, my son absolutely loved the place. He did not want to leave. He has no complaints.}","Oklahoma","werockthespectrumenid.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","73703","{}"

I’ve never walked in and smelled any funky smells or seen it dirty, so cleanliness here is top notch. The playground is lots of fun for the littles, and staff is friendly as well which is pleasant. But I do have one big complaint, and that is that when purchasing tickets, I have to pay a full price ticket when all I am doing there is sitting and watching my kids play. They use to only charge ticket entry if you planned on also getting in on the fun of the playground with your kids, which sometimes I would happily do and have no problem. But there are times when I don’t, and I’m just there to watch my kids have fun, and they now require that regardless, you have to pay. I am super pregnant, I will not be doing anything but sitting in my bottom and watch my kids , I don’t think it’s fair to have to pay for that. Honestly it makes it really hard to afford taking my 4 kids when I also have to pay for myself and my husband to just sit there. It’s the main reason I haven’t been back for a long time, the price isn’t worth it sometimes as a one income household, which is a bummer bc besides that it’s a good place to take your kiddos. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Juan Sanchez ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you so much for taking time to review us!

It is an experience they will remember long afterward. Grandparents can enjoy the smiling faces of pure joy. The staff were friendly and kind even when cleaning poop and puke.

We went on a Saturday right when they opened and it was awful. Couldn’t enjoy the toddler section with my little because kids 7-10 were in there controlling all the toys and pushing babies out of the way. My older one couldn’t enjoy the big kid section because soooo many adults were playing?? Sliding, jumping on trampoline, climbing through the jungle gyms. It was a hot mess. My daughter was trying to jump on trampoline but there were 5 adults on it jumping and she couldn’t even stand back up. It was our first time there and it was terrible.

As I ran to my child she continued to be on top of him. I had to push her off of him for her to realize she was hurting him. Then someone in her group attempted to argue with me about how they didn't know they weren't allowed on the trampoline with small children around. This place is poorly managed and the adults attending this location will body slam your child on the trampoline and not care. We attempted to tell the girls at the front desk who looked oblivious on what to do. We left and called to speak with a manager ... Ended up getting someone else who told us she was working in the kitchen and had no idea what had happened. The adults were not asked to get away from that area or asked to leave. I'm ashamed I ever thought this place was a good idea and I'm lucky we aren't in the emergency room right now. This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen and should be shut down for poor management. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: anon anon ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: Poorly managed facility.

Towards the end of the play time, my daughter (4) was trying to put up the stuffed animal she was playing with but obviously didn't remeber where it went. She tried putting it on the grocery shelves and the worker snatched the toy, threw it towards the pretend check-out registers, and aggressively told my daughter ""that isn't where that goes"". She didn't realize I saw, and when I walked up and asked what happened, she faked a smile and tried to act calmer.  They shouldn't hire people who don't have patience for kids. She wasn't being loud, mean, or running around. My daughter was just putting a stuffed animal on a shelf. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ceecee ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Cute little play spot but the bathrooms smell absolutely disgusting!!!!

Over the past few years, we’ve supported this local business, spending quite a bit. Earlier this year, we hosted a birthday party at their Broken Arrow location, and we frequently purchase toys from their shop. It’s a lovely place to play, always clean and well cared for, with typically friendly staff. ⏎  ⏎ Our son is neurodivergent and can sometimes be loud or energetic. My husband and I fully understand this, and we are doing our best to parent him with care, encouraging him to be gentler and quieter while respecting his creativity and happiness. I watch him closely and correct him as needed. Today, he was being a bit loud and unreserved, but I felt he was creatively engaged, so I was observing to see if he would self-regulate. ⏎  ⏎ One of the co-owners was also watching him, and it was clear she was not pleased. I understand there are rules and expectations, and we’re always willing to follow them. However, had she spoken to me with compassion or redirected his play respectfully—without a disparaging look or comment under her breath—I wouldn’t be writing this review. ⏎  ⏎ Again, I acknowledge that my child can be a bit much, and we’re very mindful of the rules and of caring for the space. We truly needed just a little understanding today. For families with neurotypical children, this is a wonderful place to play. However, if your child is neurodivergent, be prepared for a possible lack of understanding and some judgment. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jordan Koss ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: My 2 year old had his birthday party here and loved every minute.

I was made aware by my 8-year-old that a grown woman, maybe in her late 60s,  yelled at her, asking her to get out of the ninja course because it was her grandchildren's turn. All while she was walking out of the ninja course. Unfortunately, my daughter notified me on our way home because the women scared her, and she was afraid to tell me when we were there.*** FYI all this happened while I was sitting at the chair area wish I would have been made aware of while we were there to notify staff then***.                                          I turned back to inform the employees, and I ran into this woman in the parking lot and politely questioned her. She started yelling at me, saying she was being “stern.”I'm sorry, but that woman had no right to yell or be stern with children who are not hers. If my children were at fault, the staff should have been notified. Unfortunately, after the incident, I was told the staff could not do anything since my child did not make them aware of the incident when it happened. To the women that felt comfortable yelling “Get Out!” To an 8-year-old in a kids' indoor park while they were playing, I’m sorry your heart is broken! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Taylor ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 3 weeks ago ⏎ Review: My girly LOVES Playbox!

The first time we had nothing but good things to say, but after this last party we left feeling very dissapointed at the way we were treated. We very much felt like inferior guests and undervalued customers. When we arrived for our kids party there was a sign on the door saying they were closing early for a private party. Well…part of the draw to this facility is that after your allotted party time, your guests can stay and play as long as they want. Instead we were rushed out. When talking to the manager she claimed that she called us, yet neither my husband nor I have any calls or voicemails from the playbox. She offered to give us a couple passes for free play, but we felt this warranted bigger measures as this was our child’s birthday that was cut short unknowingly to us who paid a lot of money for our guests to continue to stay and play. 2 free play passes does nothing, how about making it right? It was embarrassing, even our guests were upset. It takes a lot for us to complain and I understand mistakes happen but there was no compassion or understanding for our frustrations from the staff, only a lack of accountability. In the future, if private parties are booked and there are previously booked parties shortly before, the staff should confirm with the surrounding parties and if people are unhappy, then they should be allowed to back out of their reservation and book their child’s special day at a facility that will be equally accommodating. Please keep in mind before booking your kids special day here, that their day can be cut short without your knowledge in order to accommodate a private party who will provide more money to the business. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Lorna Pickett ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: Took my grandkids here right before school restarted.

This one in Mustang has a center section that kids can run through, but it is small, and is only 2 levels. It is short, so adults can't really go through it with the children. Around the center structure are other play areas. There is a fire station with nothing in it. There is a school room with nothing in it. By nothing, I mean 3 walls, and nothing even on the walls. There is a market with a few groceries, 2 carts, a cash register, and, inexplicably, a toy oven. There are no pots and pans or cooking utensils. There is a section in the back with toys for little ones. There is a food truck that has no play food or drinks or anything else that came with it out of the box. There is another kitchen with no items to play with it. It makes no sense. Why have these things? They just made my grandchildren wander around, looking for the missing ingredient to this place, which is fun. There is an awful lot of fun missing.

Other play places we went to had broken parts or ripped vinyl, but this one did not. ⏎  ⏎ - It’s well set up. It has a large play area with great slides and fun tunnels. It also has a large carpeted area around the outside of the main playground equipment to play if it’s too busy. It also has a great toddler area for your little ones and play shops (Firehouse, School, and Market). ⏎  ⏎ - Good Location.

However when we arrived at 5:00, there was a sign on the door that said they closed at 5:30 for a private party. I asked if we could just use one of the play passes (for two kids) or have a discounted price since we would only would get to play for 30 min because of the early closing. Nope.

I just had my daughter's birthday party there and it was perfect! Gwen, the owner, was so sweet and helpful. I LOVE that you have the place to yourself for parties so it doesn't feel so overwhelming. Also I strongly recommend doing the balloon drop. They do all of the work for it and the kids absolutely had a blast. ⏎  ⏎ They also have a whole area with tables which was perfect for our decorate your own cupcakes we had.

My kids have attended birthday parties here from infant and toddler age to preschool and elementary age (and we’ve come for free play too). I love that neurotypical and neurodivergent kiddos alike can enjoy all the sensory play options. When my oldest suggested that we host our 5 year olds birthday here, I was all for it! They make party planning so easy! The decorations, utensils/plates/napkins, beautiful cake, juices, and pizza were all included in the party package we booked. We did a morning party so decided to cater Chick-Fil-A breakfast instead (super easy since CFA is in the parking lot). The owner is the loveliest and kindest human. We’ve told all of our friends to book their parties here too! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: J C ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: This place is Awesome.

I loved that we were able to rent out the entire place. It made it really nice to just let the kids go and play without wondering where they were at all time. We had plenty of time to set up and take everything down. The pretend play area was a huge hit! I also really appreciated the prompt replies to my emails  whenever I had a question. ⏎  ⏎ I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) Consider having a bucket for toys that get dirty. We had little ones that like to put things in their mouth. We weren't really sure where to put those toys because we didn't just want to leave them. If I missed where the bucket it is then please disregard this suggestions! 2) Maybe clean up the wall where the birthday banners typically go in the party room. We didn't have a big banner, and we had to do our best to cover up the holes and chipped paint. There was a lot of left over tape on the walls, and it just didn't look that nice. ⏎  ⏎ None of this takes away from the experience, which is why I still want to give it 5 stars. I would definitely have a party here again! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Christopher Ward ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: I have a daughter with downs.

It's like walking into the best kids physical therapy unit. So many options for the kids to play . There are swings, balls, tunnels, steps, a trampoline, climbing wall, sensory slide, and other sensory exploration items.    They also have a calming room if someone is overstimulated and needs to have some me time.   In the back there are regular toys and other imaginary play items, like kids kitchen and deli. Also they have a table for trains and one for magnets.  I'm sure I'm missing something.

The kids had fun and I believe you guys are doing a great job at serving the kiddo community with disabilities however the gym was just not clean. The blue foam tiles were clearly dingy and dirty, I even noticed that there was crushed up Cheetos under the foam arch slide. The sock rule is not enforced. Half of the kids had socks on half didn’t. The foam floor really needs to be cleaned and sanitized or replaced and start fresh. The stairs to the slide and zip line were really dirty too. ⏎  ⏎ I’m used to our gym when it’s busy the workers coming through doing some pickup/sanitizing. Some of the toys looked dingy/dirty. I didn’t notice a “germ worm” anywhere to put mouthed toy items in to make sure other kids don’t play with them.  The calming corner was extremely crammed with items making it so really only one kid could fit in at a time to calm down. The pretend play section was wrecked 2 hours in from opening. I did pick up after my kids, but obviously not all parents do. ⏎  ⏎ I also felt there was too much things in the gym area, that it made it almost hard to walk through. I kept trying to move the balls and put up the different foam pieces to make room but there was just a lot in a tiny area. The swings are a bit close together and the walkway is pretty nonexistent so I actually got hit by a kid swinging. ⏎  ⏎ The kids did have fun but I’m just used to the cleanliness and space of our old we rock the spectrum. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Allison Mays ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: We love Gwen ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Courtney Burns ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: We love the gym!

They are always connecting families with support, resources, and offering respite care for parents to get a break when they themselves never get a break (and are so very deserving of one). ⏎ There are toys and supplies located all over the gym because it is a place for children to PLAY and use their imagination, learn, grow and develop. If you are looking for a sad beige aesthetic with no creativity or color, then this will not be the place for you. If you are looking for a place for your children to feel free to be themselves, use their creative brain while having sensory stimulation.... have a moment of peace of mind for yourself, potentially make close friends who understand your struggles and celebrate your successes as a parent, and have lots of fun in a colorful, thriving environment, then please come hang out with us! If you come after a large crowd has just left and you're unsatisfied...I encourage you to offer to help clean up. Everyone deserves some help sometimes. You don't know the kind of day they may be having or how much they would appreciate it. In the time it takes to write a negative review you could do something about your complaint. Kindness and compassion go a long way in making the world a better place. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jasmine A ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Best birthday party ever! The owner was absolutely amazing and sweet. She had everything clean when we got there for our sons 1st birthday. We booked the place after hearing and reading how all ages could have fun here and our son is barely learning to walk. I also really appreciated the private aspect of the birthday rental. My son gets overstimulated with too many people. It was PERFECT!!! It had a small play area built like a shopping/pretend play area for little ones 1-5. All of the kids at the party hardly cared for the pizza and desserts because they couldn't stop playing. It was full of toys and play equipment suited for everyone. I don't think they knew where to start. I only wish she wasn't so booked, or else we would have paid for another hour. All the moms loved it and wanted to know about the booking info for their little ones. I HIGHLY recommend this facility! We will definitely be back again during regular business hours and most likely for his next birthday. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Dustin Engles ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: Edited a year ago ⏎ Review: We had my daughters 3rd birthday there and it was a lot of fun.

We were able to rent the entire place and the decor is absolutely beautiful, cute, posh, and kid friendly. It was just wonderful to have alerting taken care of for you. We purchased the package that included cupcakes and the Dino that comes out to dance. I was also impressed with how organized it was and there were different play areas each with its own play theme. My daughter loved the little kitchen area and some of our little guests enjoyed wearing the costumes that were set up in the back. Jill helped us coordinate our party and was just absolutely kind and walked me through everything. They did let us bring our own cake and food. Some of the parents went next door to get some coffee because with that many kids running around, you need to keep up. That in itself was convenient for the adults. The goody bags that were provided had some fun quality toys in there. We appreciated the nice personal touches like the slide show photos of our daughter and the little sign with her picture on it was so sweet. Dino Kidz really went that extra mile.This is the Allen location. I would’ve chosen the one in Carrollton, but most of our guests live closer to Allen.

Today we celebrated my daughter’s first birthday here and I literally can’t even put into words to explain my gratitude and happiness for this place. First of all let’s talk about cleanliness and space, this is hands the cleanest play place in all of DFW. Everything always looks so immaculate  every time we come in. You can tell they care a lot about the health of children with how clean they keep it. They’re always adding new things, the space is open, and there is so much to do for all ages, from a babies to 9 year olds. Second, price point, which for me is huge. So many play places now a days don’t have many budget friendly options. Dino kidz has that still while having the cutest special customizing that’s included in your package which just made our party feel so elevated! Like the slideshow of pictures of our daughter and the sign out front. Lastly, Jill and the girls are actual angels from heaven and decorated everything so beautifully. They were helpful, kind, informative, and loving to us and all of guests. Anyone who disagrees with that, must have a mental illness. I literally couldn't have gotten through the day without these ladies. Jill is also so good with the kids, she came and sat on the ground and played with my daughter and I for a minute, and my daughter tried to hold on to her which she doesn’t do to most people! They explain the rules about the keeping the door shut and yucky bins and that’s it! Normal rules about not carrying toys when climbing, which thank goodness for that right? We have some wild brothers and older kids in our party, no one broke the rules, no one got yelled at, kids were able to be kids! I love the music and activities they have planned and the schedule for their parties, it keeps the kids interested and no one is sitting around bored. The good-bye bubble party at the end is the best idea. The pictures I took don't even do it justice. I would have my kids party over and over again at Dino Kidz! We thank you guys for giving us the best party for our baby girl. We will never forget it.

There was a lot of hair in the ball pit. Our white socks turned brown on the bottom after 30 minutes. The place itself was cool, lots of things to do for the kiddos and the lady working the front desk was VERY kind! However the cleanliness of the play area is just not there and that’s extremely important. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Arielle Brodsky ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for the 5-star review Arielle! 🦕 … ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Abigail Haag ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: I am a stay at home mom of two and am always looking for ways to get the kids out of the house and active.

The pizza was cold after sitting too long. ⏎ 3. The staff was friendly but didn’t know much about what my party consists of. We had a themed character, a balloonist, & a face painter. The host was not aware until she looked it up. ⏎ 4. They only clean 15 minutes before the next party ⏎ They leave previous party balloons out even when they don’t match current theme. ⏎ 5. Need newer play equipment ⏎ 6. Behind the counter is chaotic clutter ⏎ 7. Vegetable & Fruit Platter should have been a better presentation. I can get better from Kroger. ⏎ 8. Buy your own cupcakes, the ones provided were just ok. ⏎ 9. For $1700, I expected a lot more from Dino Kidz not the 3rd party vendors. ⏎  ⏎ The PROS: ⏎ 1. You get the place just for your party ⏎ 2. 3rd party vendors really know how to hype a party, the balloonist was exceptional. The face painter was also wonderful. ⏎ 3. The staff was friendly & good at hosting ⏎ 4. They set-up & clean up ⏎ 5. The dance party was great ⏎ 6. The slideshow was a very special touch ⏎  ⏎ Overall, because of the balloonist & the themed character we were able to hype the party & make a really nice time.

Lots for him to him do. I would say the place is good for 9 and under. As of 10/11/2024 it's 250 for two hours, 15 kids, if any kids are added it's a additional 5 dollars per child. You can arrive 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after to clean up party room.       Cons. I asked the owner if she could turn on the music, she told me it was already on, which I believe her, but it was so low, that even she had stop breathing to hear it. I didn't push the issue, but she could have turned up at least one or notches, I feel like that made the atmosphere feel dry. Then towards the end. I'm not forsure if she was just over the party or what, but she definitely reminded me that it's the last 30 minutes and I should have my GUEST start cleaning the play area before we go back to the party room. I have never been to place, that asks you to do that, Mind you most of the party was littles. That is wasting the time that I paid for, I would have happily picked up after but, definitely not during. My guest or there parents shouldn't have to worry about that. I chose not to make my guest clean up and I told everyone to go back to the party room. That gave us guest enough time for cake, pizza, and presents. The party ended right on time giving us the 30 minutes allotted for the clean up. My older kids and the few stranglers at the end would have cleaned, but her and her husband already cleaned up the play area.

This is the second time we come as they loved it so much the first time.  It is super clean and the play area has many different things that you don't see in other places which my kids enjoy.  It is a safe environment and not full of the games which you have to pay for separately like in many other places.  We come from far but it is so worth it.  It is also very reasonably priced.  The employees are so helpful.  Nice sit area for the parents with great wifi.  A must ! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Holly Cates ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: I recently attended a birthday party of a friend.  When entering with my children, I was told by the owner that I would not be allowed to enter the party area because of my “situation”-meaning I’m a wheelchair user.   He stated that when it came time to sing happy birthday, he’d have the group come to the front area.   He stated that my wheelchair posed a danger to the children in the play area.  My manual wheelchair was a concern for him due to liability and  the possibility of children running into me.  I explained that the room was about 8 feet away.   He suggested I could possibly enter through the back door. I then suggested I would be willing to crawl to the area if it made him more comfortable.  He declined with an eye roll. ⏎  ⏎ I suggested that he could escort me to the party room if it made him feel more comfortable but I would not be uprooting an entire party because he was, in my opinion, displaying discriminatory practices due to not understanding how individuals use their mobility devices and most of the children in the facility knew me. ⏎  ⏎ Needless to say he made a huge production of “clearing a path” for me to be escorted into the party room.  And did It again when it was time for me to leave.  I was told that I was NOT allowed to leave the party room.  I was unable to watch my children play.   My youngest got hurt in the equipment  (shockingly not by my wheelchair) and  she had to come to the party room (where I was) for assistance. ⏎  ⏎ This is not equal access.  This was not treating anyone with dignity.  He stated flatly that he was being reasonable and trying to protect the children.  I assure you, I’m not large.  I’m not quick.  And I work with children daily.  I am not a danger to children. ⏎  ⏎ This was a humiliating experience.  I will never go back again.   If you are a wheelchair user, please know…you will not be allowed into the play area without him escorting you and thats only to a designated area only.    I’m not even sure if children with mobility devices will be allowed into the facilities. ⏎  ⏎ Such a shame.  It was an adorable facility. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Christopher Cates ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: They say they are wheelchair assessable but they are not. The owner doesn’t adhere to ADA and is rude and prejudice to people with disabilities. Treating people who are fully functioning adults that navigate society on a daily basis as less than does not reflect well on you as a person or your business. You might as well put a sign on the door that says “Disabled not welcome”. You can’t treat people as if they aren’t welcome because you are ignorant to their abilities. You also don’t need to clear a path for people in a wheelchair and make a big production about it. They get around fine all day without people clearing the way for them. Shameful, disturbing behavior. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Andres Short ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: You want to relax in a clean place while your kids are having fun this is the place you want to go.

From the moment I booked a few weeks in advance, Corey, the owner, was incredibly helpful and professional, making the entire process smooth and stress-free. ⏎  ⏎ One of the things I appreciated most was that booking a party reserves the entire facility exclusively for your private event—no worrying about overcrowding or unexpected guests. I also loved that Jungle Castle updates their Google hours to show ""Closed"" during private parties to prevent the public from walking in for free play. That level of organization and respect for private events is something you don’t see everywhere! ⏎  ⏎ When I sent my birthday theme, I was amazed at how perfectly they decorated everything down to the last detail! They even provided a beautiful cake stand, making it so much easier for me. I didn’t have to stress about decorating or ordering anything other than our cake, which was a huge relief! ⏎  ⏎ Our main hostess, Teagan, was phenomenal! She was not only attentive and professional, but I could tell she genuinely loves kids and what she does. She made me feel supported and heard throughout the entire party, ensuring everything ran smoothly and that my little one was having the best time. ⏎  ⏎ Since my son is still so small, having a safe, age-appropriate play space was incredibly important to me. The setup at Jungle Castle is perfect for little ones—no worrying about bigger kids running over him or unsafe play areas. It gave me such peace of mind knowing he could explore and play freely without any risks. ⏎  ⏎ Overall, Jungle Castle exceeded my expectations in every way!

They served everyone when it was time to eat. They have baby wipes in the play area (if you have a toddler, you know how important this is lol). I checked around to so many places and this place BY FAR had the best customer service and deal on a birthday party for my 2 year old. We got everything we needed in our package, which also included the room being fully decorated before we arrived. We had such an amazing time!

There were bubbles and music, and my wife and I were so happy that our son and all of his little friends had such a great time. In fact, several children were refusing to leave when it was time for their parents to collect them. 🤣 A well deserved five stars for the environment, safety, management, and cleanliness.

We go there a lot, and each time, she makes new friends. She loves for me to count how long it takes her to go down the slide from going through the play place. I prefers Jungle Castle to other play places because it has a calmer vibe to it, and I know where my daughter is at all times. It’s good for babies to big kids.

The place can get crowded with mere 20-ish children. Very narrow area to walk around and kids keep running in to each other in every play area, not a desirable thing especially with all kinds of flus making rounds. They need serious expansion of their play space. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Joey Kamal ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Dear Joey, Thank you for the 5 star review and being part of the Jungle Land Family ! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: DontWorry BeHappy ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Booked my sons bday party here and it was great.

There was someone here (volunteering) when we got here, but she left shortly after. So there may not always be someone here. Other than that, it’s a great place.

We had a play date there and to 2yr olds and 4yr olds they were using the terms “timeout” “your going to be in trouble” although I use these terms myself I am the parent and not a stranger and a stranger should never say that to a child that isn’t theirs. Us parents were talking care of the “issues” each time. Also they need to have better barriers to keep kids from getting behind the inflatables. It was a very disappointing experience and truthfully never wants to go back again. My kids even said it wasn’t fun thanks to the staff member and they are 2 and 4 making this statement. That says something. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Antoinette Wright ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Would like to have different bouncy areas after a while.  6-9 years will have the best time there.

The girls at the front desk explained the rules to us- as always, but kids will be kids…the front desk girls almost seemed annoyed at not just my kids but all the kids playing. Specifically my kids- no running, ok i get it but sometimes toddlers don’t understand so they don’t need to be told every time they make a mistake. My oldest was playing near the toddler section knowing he couldn’t get in because we were following the rules, and along comes front desk to tell him he can be there but can’t touch the blocks. At this point we’re already frustrated because it seems we are being monitored. We even overheard them talking out loud saying “I’m done telling them” . If you’re going to work at a place specifically for kids, please make it an enjoyable environment. I was also not the only parent annoyed at this time. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Bettina Loughman ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sara Kissinger ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: Let’s imagine is a safe fun environment for your child.

Let’s IMAGINE a business where the employees laugh in the faces of parents of those children because they have expressed a safety concern and simply just wanted a refund for a different time. Let’s IMAGINE that employees of this business find joy in the pain of others when they just want their child to have a fun experience. Well, then you have came to the right place! This business needs to go through extensive training on how to properly handle specific situations and accommodate children with different learning curves and disabilities. Parents shouldn’t feel ashamed of how their child will be seen or treated when going into a public place. DO BETTER!! BE INCLUSIVE!! BE KIND!!

My kids range from 10 to 2 and my 4 y/o has profound autism, every one of them had a blast!! If your littles have any sensory issues the music might be just a tad loud but once you get into the play area all the foam (padding) muffles it down nicely. This place is truly for everyone, big kids, little kids, awkward in-between kids, special kids, and adults who are kids at heart ❤️. We will definitely be coming back (I wish tomorrow), and would not hesitate to recommend this place to EVERYONE. Best money I've spent this year.

We were excited to see the new facility and was hoping to have a good time. While he was playing and having a good time on the peg wall an older boy decided to shove my baby to the ground because he was taking the pegs off the wall. This was completely unacceptable and the parent didn’t see this happen for some reason. I’m sorry but in a place like this children should not be left unattended because my son could have gotten hurt by this significantly older boy in the toddler area.

It’s a great indoor option when the weather isn’t very good. It’s very clean. I would love to leave more stars, but during our most recent visit we were told that our “day pass” we purchased was only good if we stayed in the parking lot. We had gone back to our relatives’ house to allow our 2 year old to nap. This policy was not communicated when we made our purchase, and even though we presented our receipt, we had to pay for two day passes for one child. This policy should be changed or it should be clearly communicated to everyone upon purchase. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Allyson Butler Summers ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Chris Cooper ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jessica Luna ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Willie Boothe ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Highly recommend.

This was the first time I have ever spent money on a ""venue"" for a party.  Will I do it again?  maybe, all places for kids parties are about the same in price. Value for the price is so so.  I spent close to 500 for Party Room B.  The room was a nice size to fit all my guests and super clean and ready for me to decorate.  The party came with 15 drinks for kids and 2 pizzas.  Great if you are just planning on feeding kids.  If you are wanting to feed the grownups too then you will need to purchase more pizza and drink packages... I understand the reasoning for no outside food or drinks but I also find it silly that I have to spend 40 dollars for 40 waters that I could easily buy at walmart for maybe way less.  It was a Saturday so that place was insanely crazy as you can imagine but all the kids had a great time.  You are only allotted 90 minutes for party set up/ take down and party time.  I feel like it was a little rushed, decorations were taken down I feel like almost right after putting them up.  I think people should get a full 2 hours.  I brought my own decor but made sure it was all put together at home so that when I brought it in all we had to do was tape to the wall.  Brings me to my next point.  We were not allowed to thumb tac anything and could only use tape they provided (which was NOT good tape).  My decorations kept falling, which was very frustrating.  I was given a party host Chelsea.  Chelsea was phenomenal!  She helped we bring decor to the room, helped me put decor up, helped decorate the highchair, kept the party moving smoothly, handed out pizza, helped with cake, helped clean up after my baby after his smash cake.  She was my right hand man and I couldn't have done the party without her.  Thank you Chelsea, well deserved included gratuity.   I love playpalz and will always return for a fun play day but as for a party place I feel like there are cheaper options out there that allow you to bring your own outside food and drink for a longer party time. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: manuel frausto ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Great Place to bring the kids ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: DEBBIE Barrow ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Great fun for the kids! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: CHARGER FOELIFE ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Was not worth it at all.

Large play area, two ball pits, a ""road"" to ride their cars around, soft play area for under 4 and even a little reading area for kiddos who get overwhelmed or would rather sit for a spell! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Laura Schwindler ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: To start, My child loved getting to play on the equipment they have and with their friends. They didn't want to leave at all, which is why I'm leaving 2 stars. I took off 3 stars because I did not see the value for the amount of money spent and I will explain why. ⏎ First reason: they only include 20 slices of pizza and 15 drinks [what the girl on the phone to confirm my party add ons said, even though their website states 20 drinks are included] for up to 25 guests and those 25 guests, include adults. You may not bring any outside food or drink, which is fine, but the amount charged for the food they provide is high. I added on a fruit tray [that was $60] because I wanted the fruit available for the kids and from my child's party last year, that was about what I spent on fruit for my own fruit trays and I wouldn't have to wash and cut it... the fruit tray that was brought into the party room was in a store bought container and was less fruit than what I spent $60 on last year, plus the very large strawberries were whole. For a place that has all ages of children, I find it incredibly odd that they did not at least half, if not quarter the strawberries. The high food add ons, that you're pretty much forced into, also contribute into my ire on my third reason. ⏎ Second reason: I paid for a theme add on and for that $30, I got a themed happy birthday sign, a stack of themed plates, a stack of themed napkins, & about 5 themed tablecloths. I did not get to keep any of those supplies and you could clearly see labelled boxes under the tables for other themes. It was also clearly outlined, that plates, napkins, tablecloths, & utensils were already included in the base party price.... I'm super confused on why the add on stated ""come in to your party already decorated,"" when it was a sign and tablecloths and why the add on is $30. ⏎ Third reason: we had a party host included in the base price that was for ""party set up, clean up, & to coordinate,"" that gets an automatic 5% gratuity added on to your final bill. I'm totally fine with the concept, but the execution was lacking. The host did the set up and clean up, but the only thing she did for ""coordinating,"" was ask when she should have the pizza in the room. For a tipped position with coordinating the party as part of the position, I expected the host to actually have a timeline and help us stick to the timeline within the 90min we had the room for. She was nowhere to be seen part of the time and the other part of the time she was just in a corner of the room watching people. Actually making sure your parties are happening on schedule is important... We were supposed to have 10min before the party in our party room. We arrived exactly 10min before, to find the party room was not actually ready and it was past our party start time before we got to go back to it. I highly suggest coaching your host staff on giving parties a heads up when there's 30min & 10min left and leaving more time in between parties to accomodate for any running a little over, clean up, and so incoming parties actually get their 10min before their guests start arriving to get settled in. ⏎ Fourth reason: Overall customer service... I ran out of room to fully elaborate, but there were multiple times I was asked about adding their add ons and multiple times I had questions that were not answered. There was no guidance on where to finish paying for the party and despite asking for a receipt as I checked out, I still had to go back for it. The woman that did complete my transaction, did ask how the party was and did ask for feedback on what could be better; I was just too overwhelmed and tired in the moment to answer her then. ⏎ Fifth reason: the bathrooms are in the no shoes area and my partner immediately left the mens room and went somewhere else to use the bathroom. ⏎ Sixth reason: Included in the base price is a t-shirt and FREE return pass for the birthday child... We did not receive a t-shirt or any kind of voucher nor did we receive information on how we can redeem the return pass. ⏎ Please train your staff better. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jolee Jackson ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: The place it's self was great besides the smell the only complaint is that I had my 2 year old in the 4 and under section and there was a 8 year old we had to keep telling to stop hitting and pushing my kid and then my last straw was when she put her knee in my child's stomach and kept pushing her under the balls my kid could have been seriously hurt I don't recommend this place if you have small children ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alexis Gilmore ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Very clean and fun! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ashley Artiga ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Great visit!

I’m assuming sewer gas because it was strongest near the bathroom. But it permeated the whole place. My clothes, including my jacket that was kept very far away from bathroom, actually still smelled like it even after I left. Bathrooms had filthy floors and trash can was overflowing. The nursing room is dingy and super depressing. The bins for shoes were beyond dirty and gross. The play space was decent but could use a good deep cleaning. Pros were it was an ok price for an indoor playground and the snacks were cheap.

The police station has a holding cell for someone serving a life sentence, presumably a rapist or murderer. A cop pointing a gun at a menacing perp handcuffed in a police car… I wish more thought was given into the decision to add these to the assortment of great play activities.

Our daughter and her friends had a great time! Prior to booking we were told that we would have a party host. Our host was very inattentive. She was in the room when we came in. She left out while we were in the process of handling our signs and putting treat bags out. She spent the remainder of our party time in the front desk area socializing with co workers.  My adult guess, my husband and I all had to “work.” I had to leave the party room to multiples to ask for things such as our drinks. We never mind to pay for and tip good service. I hope that you all will make improvements. I currently feel that we received false advertisement. Stop telling potential customers that parents can come in and relax as a selling pitch if that is not going to be a reality. Lastly, the mandatory tip that is added to the bill should be optional especially in situations like this. This is a great facility for kids unfortunately the customer service does need to be made a priority. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Amanda Raulston ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Update 10/24- a lot of improvements have been made.

You see them constantly wiping everything down. There are bathrooms located in two places in the building as well as two places that can be used to nurse in private. There are different sections for the kids to travel to and engage in different activities. My kids spent a lot of time in the obstacle course/ball pit, but they also really enjoyed the hammock swing quiet room that had blocks. You can bring your own food and drink and cone and go as you please which means you can break for nap or lunch and return. They keep your belongings safe behind the counter and do a number system to make sure kids go home with the correct adults. It's a very chill place, kids can get energy out but it doesn't overwhelm you as a parent. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ray Soldinie ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 days ago ⏎ Review: Really nice people and great place!!

They also have coffee and allow you to bring in your own drinks and snacks.

The worker was super energetic and professional. They have a coffee and tea bar for adults, but you have to go up front and ask for the bag inserts. It’s not so big to where you lose your child in a hoard of other kids. I like the fact that it’s all day play. You can pay once, play,  and leave if you need to grab lunch or something, then you can come back and play more. The only negative is that I wish I could’ve purchased water instead of having my child drink from the fountain. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Brandi Hoback ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: We were so incredibly impressed by this venue!

I love that this is a local family owned business and that we are supporting them and also supporting a fellow veteran family. They are nothing but friendly, all smiles, welcoming, and hard working. They stayed active the whole time we were there, cleaning, asking if we needed anything, offering to make coffee, etc. I feel they are priced fairly and have a variety of activities to keep the kiddos entertained and also plenty of places for parents to sit. They  have planned it out so thoughtfully having things like tables and chairs, highchairs, changing rooms (with extra diapers and wipes), nursing areas, multiple bathrooms, AND it's all very well kept and clean which is a big deal to me!

Tons of comfy seating and a cozy little coffee/tea bar—such a thoughtful touch. ☕💕 ⏎ But what really stood out was the outstanding service.

The place was so clean and well run. They were constantly cleaning floors, bathrooms, play structures, toys, everything so you actually know it is clean! The variety of toys and activities is great for all ages. It's great for both cautious and adventurous kids. I also loved as a parent that they were super diligent about making sure kids went home with the correct adult they came with.

It is just such an amazing place to take your kids. You also get access all day & jelly beans when you leave which makes getting my toddler out the door so much easier because he never wants to leave. Oh & they have a safe place behind the counter for a bin with all your personal belongings and a number they write on you and yours kids, you all get checked before you leave! They also provide non slip socks!!!.

We had them booked for a fourth, but our daughter got very sick..  Understandably, they have a penalty for rebooking on a different date, but they took our deposit instead.  We had a reschedule expecting a small loss in the deposit (penalty as the website says), but they ended up taking our deposit.  What's the incentive now for rebooking if we lose the same money as someone who completely cancels?  We spoke to the employee there about our disagreement with the decision and the owner was there reinforcing the decision.  I think this is bad practice and their policy is unclear and ambiguous.  No consideration for loyalty to the business with three previous bookings.  If we could have rebooked with a partial loss of the deposit we would have been fine with it.  We won't be booking any more birthdays here unfortunately. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Rob Robb ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: Very place had a great birthday party there.

He did, until he wound up being harmed by a bully. Coincidently neither that child's parent nor any staff was around. I observed the incident from across the way. Now I had been watched the whole time I was there. I realized it was because we were the only ones there who did not look like everyone else.  In fact, the Manager had approached me at one point and asked me if we were leaving prior to this incident, and I said no. (Never figured out why he would ask that.) Later I thought, well, maybe it was a hint and we should have left then. I let the child and the parent (who told me I was ignorant because I did not want to speak with him) know that the bullying was unacceptable behavior. I assured the manager that that we would not ever return. I feel they probably prefer that certain people not patronize their business anyway. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Becky Lewis ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: This location is my fave of all of the indoor play places!!

There used to be a whole side of things to do besides the ball pit and slide and now there is just a linear swing line where kids go back and forth. The price hasn’t changed and a lot of the soft mats have tape applied to them and the trampolines are sagging. It needs a refresh and maintenance.

The lady at front was super helpful and the staff was really sweet but I feel like more should be done for making sure children are safe. It’s clear that parents do not pay the slightest attention to their kids here. There were a group of kids throwing objects at other kids faces and after confronting the mom, she did nothing but sit there while her children still continued to throw toys and balls at other kids faces. It’s definitely not the staffs job to parent or control other people’s kids but there should be some sort of protocol for removing children if they aren’t being nice to others or at least make the smaller area for smaller children only. It was disgusting watching older toddlers throwing objects at infant faces and nothing was done. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Nicole Adams ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Had my daughters birthday party here.

However, the unexpected closures due to private events have been really frustrating. I completely understand the need to close for private parties — it’s a great way to provide a special experience. But it would be much better if these closures were communicated in advance. It’s really disappointing to show up only to find out it's closed, especially when we could’ve planned something else for the day. My little one was heartbroken and cried when we couldn’t go in because of a private party. ⏎  ⏎ Another confusing part is that the map and online listings show the hours as 9 AM to 6 PM, which makes us think it’s open. That adds to the frustration when we arrive and it’s not. Now, we feel like we have to call every time before visiting just to be sure.

I rated it 4/5 as we had our son's birthday party and we were notified a week prior to the party on their restriction. The first 1.5 hours are in the gym and the last 30 minutes is reserved for cake/food and presents in the party room as they need time to clean up the gym and do not want kids eating and then playing on the equipment leading to them becoming sick. The website states, ""Access to entire facility for 2 hours."" This is not true. We, all the kids, presents, decorations, and food had to be out by the five o'clock time. (our rental was 3-5) This lead to much stress. I also missed out on my son opening half of his gifts and thanking the parents for coming. . You are allowed 30 minutes to set up. 15 minutes would have been perfect and then 15 to take down and pack would have been better. In the end, we will not be having another birthday party here ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Danielle Hendrickson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: My son is autistic and we travel 4 hours to Fargo every 3 months for therapy and doctors and we ALWAYS end our Fargo trip at we rock the spectrum.

With a mission that boldly declares, ""Finally a place where you never have to say I'm sorry,"" this gym is truly a haven for children of all abilities. ⏎  ⏎ My eleven-year-old son and I spent a weekend exploring the sensory-friendly activities offered at We Rock the Spectrum, and it was an experience that left us in awe. The gym boasts an extensive range of equipment, each thoughtfully designed to cater to various sensory needs. From suspended swings for balance and vestibular treatment to crash mats and pillows for fun, motor planning, and strength, the gym has it all. ⏎  ⏎ One standout feature is the zip slider, providing stress release and promoting joint and body relaxation. The trampoline offers a fantastic opportunity for building leg and core strength, while the indoor play structure enhances climbing skills and playground expertise. The inclusion of sensory-based toys and equipment is a testament to the gym's commitment to improving auditory processing and fine motor skills. ⏎  ⏎ We Rock the Spectrum goes beyond physical activities, offering a fine motor and arts and crafts area that aids in improving hand-eye coordination. The calming room, designed for regulating emotions and reducing negative sensory input, is a thoughtful touch, providing a quiet space for children to find balance. ⏎  ⏎ During our visit, my son, although initially overwhelmed by the new environment, showed genuine interest and enthusiasm. Despite not lasting long during our first visit, he expressed a desire to return—a testament to the gym's engaging and accommodating atmosphere. ⏎  ⏎ Not only did our time at We Rock the Spectrum provide a fun and inclusive experience, but it also offered valuable insights into new equipment that can benefit my son at home. The gym's commitment to inclusivity and overall awesomeness earns it a well-deserved 10/10 rating. We Rock the Spectrum is more than just a gym; it's a supportive community that understands and embraces the diverse needs of every child. I highly recommend this extraordinary space to families seeking a place where their children can play, grow, and thrive without limitations. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kayla Barr ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Such a great environment for kids to explore and learn!

They told me 13.00! I said last time it was 11.00 they just stood there and stared at me! Two young girls. I said well I guess I will have to leave then because all  I have is 11.00 they said sorry. I decided to call my husband to come back all the way here to bring me 3.00 . I told them he would be here soon and they made my 20 month old and I wait inside the gated area for 12 minutes geezers! Instead of letting us inside ! The girls were whispering back and forth.  I will never ever step foot back in this place again! They charge a clean up fee as well but the children's play area looked like tornado so they never cleaned it. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kristisa Bemiller ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Small place but perfect for kiddos.

I went here for a birthday party and the two teenage girls in the front checking people in are rude, They need training in customer service. I also observed how they treated other party attendees and they were rude to them as well. I believe they said they would call the police on a lady and she was just standing there talking to other party goers. From my observation they seem to have a problem with people of color. This was my last time supporting this place I've been here before and everytime those two are there they give me a hard time. I will spend my hard earned money where my business is wanted. Besides the rude customer service the kids enjoy themselves. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Hannah Fleming ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for the 5 star review, Hannah! :D ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mustang Creek PTO ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Michelle Ross ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Super fun place to take your littles!!

Ages 2 and 4 and they were fully occupied for 2 hours. There were many toys I'd never seen before, and everything was SO aesthetic. It is a bit pricy, but if you need a moment or to catch up with a friend or to get work done this is it! We met friends there and actually got to catch up some while our children played. They also had great Matcha, which can be hard to find in KC sometimes. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Andrew Grin ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Reyven Lawrence ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: My baby and I came for their “New Mommy” play date event. Safe to say, he had so much fun. Seeing him being able to actually interact and play with children that fall within his age group was amazing (he is 8 months). He definitely was able to thrive given in other spaces, the kids were very much in their toddler years so although he wanted to engage in play, he wasn’t able to. ⏎  ⏎ Space: I can appreciate the fact that Hümanette has a space dedicated to infants (0-18 months) but they do not have to be confined to that area. I love that they have a cozy, comfortable nursing room that’s just off of the infant play area for breastfeeding moms. Also, socks are required! Which is a positive in my book. Overall, the space has plenty of elbow room and is well organized. ⏎  ⏎ Pricing: Their prices for the play passes and play packs are super reasonable. I like that the cost for 0-18 months and even the older kids are a bit cheaper due to how they will actually utilize the space versus a set price for a child regardless of their age. The membership price could be daunting to look at BUT when you add up all that it has to offer, it’s a really good deal. ⏎  ⏎ Play Periods: They stick to their play periods to the T BUT the good thing is play passes are good for all day play, which allows for that flexibility, especially with schedules. Them sticking to the times is a huge plus for me though, especially during the flu/RSV season. They are able to not only reset the play space but SANITIZE it as well. ⏎  ⏎ Food/Beverages: I’ve had the avocado toast w/ egg + matcha latte w/ oat milk & honey. Both really good as well as the sunflower “pb&j”. The ONLY “negative” would be that the food menu doesn’t offer a lot of options, which if they did would be super convenient. ON THE FLIP SIDE, there are quite a few food options within walking distance and due to its location, Hümanette is super close to other parts of the city that one can get to within 5 minutes for even  more options. Therefore, it wasn’t worth me taking a star off. ⏎  ⏎ Overall, I am happy with Hümanette and am excited to continue to come for play dates with my little. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Cristal Barker ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Shelby Turpen ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: The Humanette facility is incredible for a kids birthday party.

Though it seemed small, there was plenty of seating for the adults in attendance to spread out and mingle/watch the kids play and celebrate. Many of us took advantage of the coffee bar and enjoyed the delicious beverages (I personally had a hot latte with sugar free caramel. VERY tasty). There was something for everyone. I could see bringing my grandbaby back for an open play session or even enjoying one of the many classes offered.

The play area was great for kids of all ages, and the adults loved the coffee! And to top it all off, Jess does the clean up at the end of the party as well.

It's by no means big, not recommended for kids over 5 imo. Our boys had a good time, but started to get a little bored after about an hour. They have a jungle gym with various sensory activities built in, our kids really enjoyed that. Comfortable seating for parents but, the play area for kids can't be larger than 1000 sq ft. Overall it was enjoyable, glad it's close and very very affordable. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kari Kelly ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: We hosted my son's 4th birthday party at rough and bumble.

Jess was incredibly helpful with setting up & tearing the event down (& can't forget Ty - she was not officially working but was so wonderful helping make the punch & get the drink area set up). The party ended at 3 pm and I was in my car heading home by 3:10 - what a relief no clean up!!! While my life was made easier by Jess's help with setting up/cleaning up, most importantly my son had seriously the best time.

I want to start by saying I visited on a Memorial Day Monday at 11 o’clock 2025- not late in the evening and I realize many may not agree with me but for those who do this is your warning. ⏎  ⏎ First, I do not let my children or grandchildren, watch music videos, such as candy shop among others (look it up if you don’t know what it is, I didn’t. The artist is 50 cent I believe). These videos portray, highly sexualized images of women gyrating in a suggestive manner and are not appropriate for young children. If these had been on upstairs in the 21 and over bowling then fine. They were not there, however, they are in the bowling alley on the big screen so children must look at them if they are going to toss their ball down the lane. ⏎ The music is also very loud. While I realize this is something in our culture that we don’t seem to care about much anymore, it is so loud it is likely damaging the hearing of those who work in this environment on a continual basis as well as patrons. We teach about cumulative damage to hearing at health fairs so I know this is something many will regret later in life. ⏎ We had a good experience with laser tag and the outdoors mini golf. Even the bowling would’ve been fine without the videos. But I will not be back because I will not expose my grandchildren to it. ⏎ Someone is going to find this review helpful. And I’m sure I am not the only one who finds these videos inappropriate for young children. ⏎  ⏎ Does heyday care more about making a cultural statement or their profits? If it’s profit how about more kid friendly videos during day time hours, and a hearing safe environment? When you address these I’ll be back and re-review ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Logan Clawson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: We had a great time bowling at HeyDay with our group of six! The entire experience was smooth and enjoyable from start to finish. The lanes were in great condition, the atmosphere was lively without being overwhelming, and everything felt clean and well taken care of. ⏎  ⏎ Our server—Adrianna, I believe—was fantastic. She was friendly, attentive, and always seemed to show up right when we needed something, whether it was refilling drinks or checking in on our order. Even with how busy it was, she never seemed rushed and made us feel like we were well taken care of. ⏎  ⏎ It really added to our night and made our group outing even more fun. We’ll definitely be coming back, and we appreciate the great service from Adrianna and the whole HeyDay team! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Nick Flores ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: Sydney was so lit!!!!!

This isn’t your average entertainment center — it’s a full-blown experience. ✨🎳🍔 ⏎  ⏎ From the moment you step inside, it’s clear: HeyDay knows how to set the mood. Neon lights, great music, laughter echoing from the bowling lanes, and that unmistakable buzz of people having an absolute blast. Whether you're on a date night, out with friends, or bringing the whole fam, this place delivers the vibes. 💃🕺🎯 ⏎  ⏎ I went in expecting a casual good time and left thinking, “Okay...this is my new go-to.” The food? Way better than expected. We're talking next-level bar & grill vibes — think juicy burgers, loaded fries, and shareables that actually make you want to share (well... maybe). 🍔🍟 And the drinks? 🍹 Let’s just say the bartenders know their way around a good pour. Creative cocktails + local brews = winning combo. ⏎  ⏎ Add in the arcade games, laser tag, ropes course, and upscale bowling — and you’ve got the kind of place that makes you lose track of time in the best way possible. Whether you're leveling up your game or just relaxing in the lounge, HeyDay brings that perfect mix of excitement and chill. ⏎  ⏎ The staff? Super friendly, helpful, and genuinely seem to enjoy being there — and that energy is contagious. 🙌 ⏎  ⏎ 📍 HeyDay Entertainment ⏎ Norman, OK ⏎ 🎳 Bowling • 🎮 Arcade • 🍔 Food • 🍹 Drinks • 🧗‍♂️ Ropes Course ⏎ Perfect for parties, date nights, and spontaneous fun ⏎  ⏎ #TrustedLens #GooglePhotographer #SnapAndReview #EpicShots #NextLevelGuide #RoadToLevel9 #LocalGuideLife #ExploreOKC #HiddenGemsOK #OKCSpots #MetroMusts ⏎ 🎭 #FunTimesOKC #MustSeeSpots #WeekendPlans #HeyDayNorman #UnforgettableMoments #SipAndSavor #BowlingVibes #GameNightGoals #ArcadeDreams #OKCAdventures ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Becky Stewart ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Well, ⏎ I used to like this place but now they charge you 3.99 for your golf ball that you get to keep to bring back the next time, REALLY plus their prices went up so for 4 of us to play we were charged an extra $24!!! ⏎ Added to the fact there is a lot of trash in their ponds (which is  understandable with the winds yesterday).

Go somewhere better and friendlier like main event. The only reason we came to heyday was because it was more local for our friends but NEVER AGAIN. ⏎  ⏎ Edit: make sure if you go to heyday that you have double the amount of money you’re planning to spend in your account as they like to double charge you when they force you to put a card on file for FOOD and place a week long merchant hold on your money plus what they’re actually charging you!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!! ⏎  ⏎ Originally a three star review: ⏎ My friends and I went to get some food and go bowling to catch up and have some fun. We unfortunately went when it was spring break which I get is a busier time. However, they were severely understaffed and at times I saw individuals that looked like management just standing doing nothing which is disappointing when service was slow. I will give it to them that their pricing for food and bowling isn’t outrageous and is on the cheaper side compared to other entertainment places. BUT I can’t get past that they charged 4 DOLLARS for drinks that came in a small plastic cup, which wouldn’t be an issue if there was service checking in regularly for refills. Also the fact that the food took almost an hour to get delivered and was lukewarm at best. Needless to say I think it’s worth it to come if you expect poor service or aren’t planning on ordering food and drinks. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jennifer Morton ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Be prepared to open a tab for just going to the restaurant and not ordering alcohol beverages. The tab holds your funds for 5 days but when they actually charge your tab to your account they have a pending transaction x 2 of your total! So now there are 2 $78 transactions pending on my daughter’s account but we can’t dispute with the bank for 5 days. So no thank you Heyday, you can keep your tab, your $4 sodas in small cups and chaos. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Aimee Mcwhorter ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: I  asked if I can  leave my food somewhere  on a counter  and when I return  it was thrown away.

This is by far the best one I’ve found. ⏎ Especially great for kids 5 and under. This is one of the safest layouts. It has 3 levels but no long straight “stairs” so that even if you’re little one were to tumble down them, it wouldn’t be too far and injury is unlikely. ⏎ They are one of the cleanest as well, you don’t see as much dust and grime in hard to clean places as you do at a lot of places. ⏎  ⏎ This place is also in great repair. Any time I see something torn up or broken, it is inevitably repaired by the next time I visit. There are some places that have had duct-taped pads, ripped netting, and exposed metal bolts for at least two years that I can confirm.

My 6 and 3 year old had a blast. It was only 29 bucks for the two kids, and 4 sets of grip socks for my kids and myself and my kids mom. We had a great time. It was safe, it was clean, well maintained, they even have a small part sectioned off for smaller kids. Although my 3 year old was able to play on the big kid side too until like lunch time when it got busy. If you want a nice place to take the kids in the morning then I would recommend.

They have a sign where it’s a place for kids up to 12 years old to play, though I honestly think it’s better suited for kids between ages 1-10. The older ones might not get as much out of it. I’ve thrown a few birthday parties here for my kids, but their older cousins tend to get bored pretty quickly. That said, my kids absolutely love it (and so do I—at least for them!). The place is always kept really clean, and you’ll see staff walking around making sure everything’s in top shape. The bathrooms are also spotless and they have a diaper-changing station. Plus, they offer free coffee while you’re there, which is a nice touch. Snacks for the kids are available, and prices for entry and snacks aren’t too bad. One tip: definitely bring socks since they’re required, unless you want to shell out for a pair on-site. Parking can be tricky on weekends since it gets pretty crowded, but it’s worth it! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alex Martinez ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: I love taking my toddler to Kids City.

I get playing with your kids but it’s not them playing with their kids, it’s kids having to wait for the older people to move out of the way. With that being said, I still am giving five stars because the facility deserves it. The bathroom is just beautiful, probably cleaner than the one at even my house let alone a public place that caters to children. The staff is extremely friendly, the facility itself is very clean, lots of places for parents to sit, big enough to follow your toddler or small child through the play places. It’s is so much to be able to interact with the kids, meet other parents/grandparents/guardians and not have to be in the heat. It’s the only time my grandson gets to play with littles and it’s important to socialize your kids even at a young age. This place is incredible. We have been to one other place like this and this one is by far nicer and provides more to do. We will be back and have encouraged friends to take their littles there, too. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Angelica Leija ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Very good service and clean and good facilities. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Chelsea Hester ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: By far the cleanest indoor kid play place!

They had an area in the front for your itsms but also once you past the gate there are plenty of tables where you can leave your stuff. The 0-5 have their own space but can also join the bigger playground area. I did notice some of the littles almost getting hurt if they ran under the monkey bar area though.

It is so well done and they are constantly walking around cleaning and ensuring kids aren't climbing slides etc. My oldest decided he wants his party here so we just booked today and are looking forward to a birthday experience here!

When we arrived, we were informed that we needed to either remove our shoes or wear shoe covers. The woman at the front desk was about to provide us with shoe covers, but the manager or owner intervened and directed her not to, instead offering us socks. Although I was uncomfortable with the idea of taking off my shoes, I complied with his request. ⏎ The situation became even more troubling when we chose a seat right by the entrance. We noticed that the same manager gave shoe covers to a caucasian woman and her daughter who had just arrived. This raised immediate questions for me—why were they given shoe covers while we were not? The manager had previously warned us that the shoe covers could be slippery and dangerous, yet he still chose to provide them to an older caucasian woman, who was over 70. ⏎ This behavior not only felt discriminatory but also left me feeling uneasy. It made me question his intentions: Did he not want us to have the shoe covers, or was he recklessly indifferent to the safety of the older woman? It’s disheartening to experience such a stark difference in treatment based on race, and it has left a lasting negative impression on our visit. ⏎  ⏎ He might attempt to defend himself by saying, ""I'm not racist; I have minorities working for me."" but it won’t work. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: James Pinwheel ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: Great cozy place to take my kids.

The two-year-and-under area did not have many options. The battery-powered toys were dead. ⏎  ⏎ Luckily, it was a big place and there were tons of things to do. The only issue I had was that not all parents supervised their children. They let their older children run around unsupervised. We were on the trampoline at one end with other little ones. There was a preteen boy whom I had seen earlier playing with his mother and three other siblings. He ran right up to my daughter and jumped, landing as heavily as he could two inches away from my toddler. If he had missed and landed on her, he would have hurt her. We had to take her off the trampoline. His mother was nowhere near him. I saw her in a different area with her other three children. ⏎  ⏎ Parents, if you cannot manage your children, or if your children are not well-behaved, do not bring them at all. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Daniel Hoffman Jr ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Fun place to take the kids when the weather is gross! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Chris Palm ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Inner Active Playground in Plymouth, Minnesota is absolutely awesome!

And it was the worst experience ever. On the top of it pricey for no good reason, the rooms not bright enough, pictures are dark because of the bad lighting. furthermore, we were treated very rude from the their  worker, after we finished from the room, we tried to sat in the craftier while the kids are playing. So we moved some chairs to sat together as a group, the worker came up to us screaming to put the chairs back that we are not allowed to move them. It was so bad for me in front of my guests. So I emailed the owner right away, but I didn’t get any response back. So clearly they do not care. So DO NOT west your money here. Go Urban Air, best customer service and you get what you pay for. The only reason I had my party here, is because I have an infant and I thought here will be better but not. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mary Facchino ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you so much for the 5 stars Mary! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kimberly Bell ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: I appreciate the convenience of the non-staff entry but I have the say the cleanliness was questionable. A lot of the equipment was visibly dirty and the soap was out in the bathroom. Made for an icky feeling in flu season. I went there mainly for the under 2 section and it was pretty depressing. A lot of the play equipment had broken parts. Push- tricycles without handles or steering wheels and broken pieces that my tot kept playing with. Needs some love and new stuff.

When you walk through the first set of doors you cannot advance further. Would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time online. Because trying to buy them on arrival is super frustrating. You are stuck between the two doors that are still the entryway, and so you have to stand there and order tickets while your kids are waiting to get in and other people are trying to get in past you. I tried 2 different cards online and it didn't work (which my cards worked fine before and after this place and have plenty of money)  So my friend had to use hers, and it worked. I look at my account and they charge my account four times and then charged it an additional four times for a dollar fee. It charged me four times and we never got any code.So my cards were working, but the website was weird. Then I see there's multiple refunds on my account while we are there. Then I all of a sudden, get 2 emails with codes 30 minutes later. What's someone else's name on it? Which doesn't make sense since I used my phone?So how was there someone else's name on my code. I went to run outside to grab a water and had my daughter stand by the door to let me back in. Since I didn't have the code and it was on my friend's phone. However, they have it so that you cannot open the door from the inside, no handles, which is a safety hazzard. And my daughter couldn't open the door to let me back in. My daughter had to run through and find my friend to give me the code. My friend even walked over to open the door but they have no handles on the inside to open the door for me. So I had to wait for her to find the code on her phone again for me to enter it. What she had to hold up to the glass so I could see to enter the code to enter in again even though we were already inside and had already paid. It doesn't appear that there's any staff there at all to help you. Kind of makes me worry that there's nobody there if there were problems. To add to that, I would say, the price is pretty high for what's there. The pictures online look much cooler than the place actually is and the pictures online are kind of deceiving. The cost to get in there is the same cost as urban air and urban area is much better quality. I would say the place is just okay, but honestly I think the admission should be about anywhere from $5 to $8. They have some cool features, but it really is just an indoor play set. I have been to other indoor playgrounds that charge a lot less. The signs everywhere are a little intense. At one point another boy hurt my daughter and her finger looked broken, I don't think it is but very swollen but there are no staff to ensure safety and that kids are not being too aggressive. Just so many odd signs, one of them being that it's a crime to enter without paying, which duh...  you should pay. But then even more signs in the two year old area that if you are able to read the sign that you're too old to be in this area. Which also a duh. But if there were some staff there to ensure rules were being followed, there wouldn't need to be so many signs. I don't know. Just overall, experience wasn't very good especially  trying to get in and the handle less door was not the greatest, priced too high, buying tickets in-between the outside doors with the cold was a little ridiculous. I don't normally leave reviews, but wanted to leave this because if I would have seen a review like this.I probably would have tried to go somewhere else. ⏎  ⏎ To also add i tried calling my friend's phone and she didn't see my call and may daughter almost couldn't hear me through the glass door so I can to shout for her to hear me. If my daughter hadn't not been by the door and my friend never saw her phone I would have been locked outside for a long time. Which is also worrisome. ⏎  ⏎ My 7YO and 6YO were bored in the first few minutes of being here i had to convince them to stay and try and make friends since we spent so much money to get in. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kathy Stroth ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: Kathy, thank you so much for the five star review! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Amy Rogers ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: Super way to let kids go crazy! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kevin Dahm ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: Pretty cool.

They found every other kids socks but not mine, so we had to buy new ones.  Other then that they were busy playing card games and doing their own thing.  For me and the needs of my kids it is a great place to keep them entertained so my husband and I could tag team christmas shopping.  I wouldn't go here for any other reason.  But,  to have one of us shop and the other to let the kids play and swap it worked perfect. Comparing this to the indoor playgrounds in the malls in California, it was pitiful but for a place to contain  your kids... this was much easier then the playground on the first floor. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Adam Almuhrezy ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kelsey ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Lobo Blade ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Danielle Morgan ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Can’t recommend this place enough.

They have a small child/baby area for kids under 36 inches where big kids are prohibited to keep them same. The other side is 2 stories. There’s a couple different slides and climbing structures. There’s a ball pit with a volcano that shoots the balls out of the top. They have their own bathrooms. The ball pit needs more balls, there’s not nearly as many as there used to be and a fair amount are crushed. The air cannons on the top level need a better way to get the foam balls up there. As is the kids have to climb up with what they can carry in 1 hand because climbing requires the other. They offer a punch card and they offer a free session once it’s full.

The price for play used to be $10. I don’t think the cost is worth it. The toys are dated and cheap, even the music is some off brand music. They haven’t updated to warrant this increase at all imo. I am not the only one, other parents in line yesterday also seemed a bit shocked at the price jump.

Your area you have for the parents to sit to watch their children is a tight fit even for someone who has 2 legs. You should really rethink the design of the seating and saying it's wheelchair accessible. Someone with crutches would have a hard time getting passed others to even get to the bathrooms to help the child. If my child was to get stuck up there I have no way of getting him down or even knowing because I can't see from the entrance. You don't want me to drop my child off but give me very limited option to watch my child.

Loveliaz ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: Vaseem is by far the worst and disrespectful owner I’ve encountered at a kids’ indoor playland. I visited Dino Kidz with my children on a Tuesday afternoon, about two and a half hours before closing time. I had previously purchased a 10-pass package and planned to use it. However, the front desk staff told me the pass had expired back in December of last year. ⏎  ⏎ This confused me because I clearly remembered visiting recently, so I asked when my last visit was. The staff checked and confirmed that I had been there in February of this year. That means I had already used the pass even after it supposedly expired, and at that time, no one informed me that the pass was no longer valid. In fact, I was told I had two passes remaining. ⏎  ⏎ When I pointed out this inconsistency, the staff allowed me to speak with the owner, Vaseem. During the call, he told me, “You already brought your kids in for free in February—now you want to do it again?” He accused me of trying to manipulate the situation. ⏎  ⏎ But the truth is, I didn’t enter for free—I had already paid for the 10-pass package in advance. He continued to imply that I was trying to get something for nothing and spoke to me with condescension and sarcasm. ⏎  ⏎ At no point was I informed that my pass had expired or that I wouldn’t be able to use the remaining visits. No notice or reminder was ever sent out. As a busy mom juggling a lot, how am I expected to keep exact track of the expiry date of a kids’ indoor play pass? ⏎  ⏎ Despite the fact that the place was nearly empty and closing time was approaching, and even though I was simply trying to use something I had already paid for, Vaseem told me to either purchase at least one single pass (since I had two kids with me) or leave. He claimed this was the “best favor” he could offer and told me, “Take it or leave it.” ⏎  ⏎ The way he treated me—like someone trying to freeload—was incredibly insulting. I’ve visited this place many times before, often for playdates with friends. But after experiencing this petty and disrespectful behavior from the owner, I will absolutely not be returning, nor will I recommend this place to anyone else. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jenin Compton ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: We adore this place!!

We had over 40 ppl in the tiny room they have. Its was so crammed and uncomfortable. We spend over a thousand dollars for the worst experience for our daughter and ourselves.

After a couple songs, the kids lost interest and just wanted to play. I’m sure this varies with age. ⏎ 2. Order from a different pizza place. Several of the kids didn’t care for the pizza.

Completely Unknowledgeable staff. Zero help, zero direction, zero communication. Literally felt like we paid for a room. Young kid that was suppose to be assisting stood in a corner the whole time. I had to go up to him multiple times to ask what was happening “umm you can tell everyone they can dance”. It was embarrassing as all my guest felt awkward and lost as well. I  then went to whom I thought was the boss, she was also absolutely no help. Zero apologies. Had to ask if I needed to serve pizza. Had to ask for juice. It was so bad. Slow to do everything but extremely quick to ask for us to leave and for the final deposit. Which was rudely asked for in front of guest. And one of the most upsetting things; I was never told that it was an additional fee (nor is this pricing listed online) to close the play area to the public (different from other locations) so to our surprise had soooo many other kids there. ⏎ I called Jill (in charge of parties based out of Allen location) and whom had been great and super responsive. She seemed extremely concerned and was very apologetic. ⏎ Final verdict- they refunded me $50!! And one free visit. - a complete joke. ⏎ Save your money go elsewhere. We had last years party at cheeky monkey and it was complete day and night experience.

It had pretty decent food as well for kids and for a quick little nibble when mom is trying to relax.

It was such a GREAT experience from the safe “for toddlers (4 and under) only” area to the in-playground security cameras for adults to have eyes on their kiddos at all times. The staff were friendly and helpful and great with kids. We also appreciated them monitoring the toddler area and clearing out big kids who were not supposed to be in there and were playing too rough around our little guy. ⏎  ⏎ We loved that we could go through the playground with our little ones, too, so even our toddler got to experience the cool look out spots and hanging bean bag features since we could help him. We loved all the bright, happy colors and the adorable monkey decorations throughout. The place felt overall very clean. The food was reasonably priced.

It answers all my thoughts and questions, wish more places were like this. Socks required. No outside food /drinks. Must sign waiver. Items for sale with price on it.

It's a great fun area for parents who live nearby.  I visited Prosper playhouse with my granddaughter on her birthday.  My daughter in law was not aware of the fact that bringing food from outside is not allowed. Although the birthday party couldn't be celebrated however my granddaughter, Mebal, enjoyed it a lot. My son informed me that the playhouse is her favourite place. Concerning the children's ages the playhouse arena is good enough however there's a shortage of places for the accompanying parents. Boutique is not available in its true sense however one can get some clothes in an emergency situation at high costs. Available food for parties and coffee is not expensive nor the playhouse fee. Anyhow this is a blessed place for your child in this hustle life. Some hours of peace in a fast life. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Chino Campos ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Zhou Tony ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: Edited a year ago ⏎ Review: Very bad customer service, as I understanding.

We were sitting in chairs by the tables and when I said I'm having him sit cause he's 1 and not leaving them on the owner Jen Clark replied everyone needed socks period which is crazy if theyre not on equipment.

We have been many times before and our daughter absolutely loves it here so it was a no brainer to have her party here. We booked it a couple of months in advance and I didn’t pay attention and had a typo in my email address for the confirmation of booking. They emailed me right away after I contacted them and they changed it to the correct one. So we started off on a great foot. I got an email a few days before the party to confirm everything we had booked. They also let us know that other than pizza we could add everything as needed while there (extra waters, juice more kids than the 11 put in at booking) and we would settle it at the end. Which was super great because we weren’t sure how many kids we would actually have. We got there about 15 min early they took us right to the party room, the hosts introduced themselves and took all of our cupcakes and got them on a nice stand, laid out the plates and napkins and put the favors on top of the plates for us. Basically got the whole room ready. They directed all the kids to the party room. The kids all ran off to play. They had a speaker system to call the kids when it was time to eat. They served the pizzas to all the kids as well as adults, they didn’t let even the adults get their own pizza which was actually really great. They handed out the waters and tended to the kids amazingly. Then at the end they get brought out two wagons and helped us get everything loaded into our car. They really took all the stress away from hosting a birthday party. I cannot say enough good things about prosper playhouse but even more so our two fabulous hosts. It was also very cool temperature wise and clean! Both get major stars from us for that! ⏎ Cannot recommend prosper playhouse enough! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Shetal ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: Great play date idea or birthday party idea! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Leslie ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: WORST Costumer service!!! The Owner being upset that I wasn’t spending money at her subpar cafe (Which was entirely untrue seeing as we had already payed $50 entrance for 3 kids buying a water bottle 2 coffees 4 Oreo packages and a $5 cup of MacNcheese) took it upon herself to throw away 2 of my kiddos drink cups because she thought they were juice. Another kiddo had the same type of cup but his wasnt thrown away which is more confusing as to why she needed to throw ours away. Had she done the right thing which was to look for me and politely tell me outside beverages weren’t allowed then I could have explained that I have come many times with the same cup and told as long as it was water it was ok which they had water from a bottle of water I purchased from the cafe. She could have asked I not bring them again I wouldn’t have cared. Instead of owning up to her mistake, realizing she handled it incorrectly and sincerely apologizing she says yea sorry with attitude and rudeness, when I further try to explain that now I have an upset toddler actively crying looking for her baby shark cup she continues with what more do you want I said I was sorry you can either grab them out of the trash or I can give you a cup of water. Suggesting I dig through trash to have my kids put their mouth on them again is disgusting. Also makes me call into question what she thinks is acceptable to do in her cafe. Oh and she didn’t forget to mention that I could just buy another juice cup but couldn’t even be bothered to offer my crying toddler a free juice box since she threw away her cup what toddler would be okay exchanging their favorite character cup for a cup of tap water ?! Needless to say I will never return, I am all for small business but NOT with that awful attitude no thank you !

The age range of the kids here is from infants to big kids. Every time we have gone here, the big kids push my two year out of the way. It has happened every time (we have been here four times now). The way this place is designed, the parents sit and let their kids go wild. (Attention parents: watch your kids and get your head out of your phone.)

This one is the worst.  Safety hazards,  such as the cut ropes on the weave flooring where your crawl (big enough for my granddaughter to fall into), foam area on the main climbing area is gapped to allow you to fall through or twist an ankle, place was very dirty. The person at the front giving the safety rules (again,  even though my family has been before) was slightly aggressive in her tone and unfriendly. ⏎ After the first visit here my daughter felt she should give it another chance. ⏎ Won't return, much better options elsewhere. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: michael bowling ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: Amazing facility ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sheila Campbell ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Debra Landry ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: Spend your money else where.

Upon purchasing the punch card, for $100 keep in mind, no one told me up front it lasted only 6 months. She should've still have 4 visits left. We come here all the time with her friend group of 7 kids.. We also had a birthday party here this past January 2022 and spent $600 on it even when they decided they did the absolute bare minimum. ⏎  ⏎ I decided, okay whatever, we're already here so i'll pay the $15 for the day pass, all I had was cash on me.. The lady up front, rudely, told me that they didn't have change for a $20 bill? Needless to say i'm very disappointed in the customer service shown today. ⏎  ⏎ They did NOT disclose all the information at the time of purchase, nor did I receive a text message saying that it was expired, and that should be against policy. They with held information to gain sales... As a business owner myself, I understand that business must go on, but I also understand when to accommodate something for a customer when it goes wrong on my end.. and for a business to not carry change when you have a concession stand and boutique? Looks like the new play dates will be held at Cheeky Monkeys instead of Prosper Playhouse. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Niecy Johnson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: sujeet kumar ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: Awesome place for kids.

Unlike some indoor parks, where you essentially pay by the hour, here you buy a day pass. On days too  cold to be outside at the park, we've literally gone in the morning and the afternoon. Areas for under 3 and of course giant multi-level maze of features - slides, bouncy ball room, foam ball cannons, obstacles. Moms and dads, if you're joining, prepare to be on your hands and knees a lot in the maze and/or be ready for the chiro the next day, it's not tall enough for adults to stand in a lot of places (and isn't supposed to be). ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Lesley Forte ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: We hosted a small birthday party there on Saturday, and the kids all had a blast.

I love it for my toddlers cause I can keep track of them when they go in different directions. The only minimal downside is that the snow room is REAL snow. Well. As real as it can artificially get lol its cold and wet and not very convenient with toddlers. We were not clothed appropriately though so thats our fault. We had just assumed it was all foam but this alternative is better. Great prices, great music and ambiance. The staff is all very sweet and the owner listens and cares about his customers. We threw our daughters birthday party here after visiting a few times and it was nearly perfect. Snags here and there but nothing that wasn’t fixed.

One of his friends said it was the best party she has ever been to! We rented out the whole place and it was such a great value. We had two helpers to set up all the decorations as well as take them down. They also served the birthday cake, and boxed up all our leftovers as well. I didn’t have to lift a finger, which means I had time to mingle with the guests. Ari was one of their names, but they were both fantastic!  The owner was also very responsive to texts which helped with the planning as well.  The only improvement I would have would be the jump house slides are not smooth enough, I noticed many kids going down and hitting a rough patch on the slide and bouncing down. This was so minor, but just wanted to provide some feedback.  Everyone had so much fun especially in the snow room which the owner worked tirelessly to fix prior to our party! We are so grateful for that, and look forward to booking with them in the future! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kelly Cooper ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Kids had a lot of fun at a birthday party here.

Summer birthday with an ice room? Why not?! To my surprise, my daughter had a blast and talks about her birthday at Snowy Fun still!  The party rooms are the biggest we’ve had at a venue which I can appreciate because it’s not only the kids we are catering to, the kids’ parents also need a place to sit while the kids are enjoying their time. I have a few suggestions for party hosts and party structure to make the transition from one party to the next a lot smoother - 1) hosts should organize and plan ahead for each party and prepare supplies and utensils in advanced to avoid having to leave the room during the party causing delays. 2) if only there was a way to allow each party to separate into the trampoline and play area without having to mix in and share with turn crowd - similar to Pump it up’s technique to avoid chaos. Lastly, have an option for gratuity to add for party hosts during check out.  Overall, the owners are kind and accommodating and hopefully these recommendations are helpful and does not come off rude. We would return as the kids had so much fun there! We also appreciate not allowing older kids to jump with young kids because you know kids aren’t aware and don’t look out for the younger ones. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Naim Uluctan ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Feel the cold with kids in texas ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alejandra Aranda ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Liliana was a great host!

Stay away! ⏎ I am deeply disappointed and outraged by the treatment my husband and children received at Kids Mania Playground. When my husband took our kids there today, the staff didn’t stamp the children’s hands after signing the waiver because the employee responsible was too distracted with her headset. When they tried to leave, another employee rudely accused my husband of attempting to kidnap his own children, simply because they didn’t have stamps on their hands. ⏎ Instead of handling the situation professionally, the employee used inappropriate language and demanded my husband show pictures of the kids to prove he was their father, threatening to call the police. When my husband stood his ground and insisted they call the police, the staff lied to the authorities, claiming my husband refused to show his ID when, in fact, she never asked for it—she only demanded pictures. ⏎ The situation escalated unnecessarily, and while the police eventually confirmed everything was in order after seeing the waiver and my husband’s ID, this ordeal happened in front of my young children. My 7-year-old was terrified and had a panic attack because of how traumatic this experience was. ⏎ This place is unprofessional, disrespectful, and downright negligent. I plan to pursue legal action over this incident. I strongly urge other parents to avoid this place at all costs—it’s not worth the risk of putting your family through such a horrifying experience. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Elizabeth Nelson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: We love this place 🎉🥳🎁 … ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Amanda Souza ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: yuk cheung ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: Employee at the counter is rude deadass.

Any party I have been invited to at this location has been complete chaos. Kids running everywhere. It is so LOUD and very easy to lose track of a little one. At one point a crying child was lost and I helped them get to the desk so that someone could call for their parent over the PA. You couldn’t even hear the employee over the crowd. Luckily, the child ended up locating his mother. ⏎  ⏎ Anyhow, anytime I have gone, the majority of the games upstairs are all out of service.  I do not understand these facilities that are at least somewhat based on arcade games that never have their arcade games in working order.  The party rooms downstairs are also very cramped, so not great for larger parties. The food is fine. No complaints there. ⏎  ⏎ I asked a friend why she didn’t go with Urban Air or another venue, and I found out that these parties are way, way cheaper than the average party place, so that explains why people always book here. ⏎  ⏎ The one plus of this place is that like Chuck E. Cheese, it does have the security measure where they check the stamp on the child’s hand and make sure it matches their adult companion before they allow you to exit. ⏎  ⏎ If you’re looking for somewhere, comparatively cheap, where your kid can run around, and you don’t mind a bunch of chaos and broken games, this may be a great place for you! Personally, an invite to a party here always gives me major anxiety and I cannot wait to leave. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: jd jr ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: BETTY OLVERA ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Myra ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: Loved it !

The floors were sticky when you walk around. The toddler area is for 3 and under but there were many 5, 6, and even 7 year olds playing inside it. It was very crowded at noon on a Friday but it's summer. The staff were on their phones when trying to leave and we had to grab their attention because they have to check your stamp to leave. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mohamad Katramiz ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Snow Lam ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Texas 2024: Destination #33 ⏎ Kid Mania ⏎  ⏎ Features: ⏎ 1.  Arcade games ⏎ 2.  Serves fast pizza/sandwich/salad and typical junk food ⏎ 3.  Clean Play Station designated for ages three and under ⏎ 4. Clean Play Station for ages 4 to 104.  My kids didn't want to go into the Play Station at first due to the crowded kids and screaming volume, but when the crowd died down, they went in and enjoyed playing inside. The Play Station is just mainly elevated climbing and walking. Not a challenging obstacle course compared to Ninja Nation or Planet Obstacle. ⏎  ⏎ Pricing: ⏎ I paid $29 for my two kids to enter the building. I am assuming that's if they came to play in the climbing maze and not for the arcade. I then paid $20 each for two play cards for my kids to play in the arcade area. The games range from fifty cents to $3 each!  For the arcade, I am better off with the Summer Fun Pass with Chucky Cheese for the same games. The son's favorite arcade is Jurassic Park and it is $3 per game! ⏎  ⏎ Food:  My kids and I don't like the low grade American food here so the not allowing food inside makes it very inconvenient. It's not an ideal place to stay long for play and eat. ⏎  ⏎ Note: Kids who don't like loud noises shouldn't come here. It's very loud. My daughter doesn't like the screaming volume from the play area. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Veronica Achebe ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: It was cheap to get in, exactly $5.40, because my child was less than 3 years old but the playground for 3 years and under was underwhelming and not interesting. The arcade games were more fun but the problem is that the arcade games cost real money so you end up paying way more than the price for general admission.
