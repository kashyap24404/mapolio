As a first-time mom, cleanliness is incredibly important to me, and Alexia goes above and beyond to make things as clean and drool-free as possible :) I love how the toy selection is perfectly curated for a range of ages!! My son finds something new to play with every time we go to open play, and we’ve been members since it opened! (If you have kids you know how fast they get sick of toys, so this is a BIG plus) We’re really looking forward to the new membership offerings starting in the fall. I tell everyone about this place – we’re so grateful it exists! ❤️"

My 3 year old would like to add, \"I like the nugget especially- because I Iike sitting on it! And I like to jump off of the nugget especially. And I also like to play the kitchen especially. And I like the teapot especially.\" Lolol - he could have kept going. We highly recommend."

The decals/decorations on several of the structures was torn and then still filthy. The rope bridge in the toddler are did not look safe for actual toddlers, designed for kids at least 4 or 5. The alarm on the door went off, a worker came several minutes later to turn it off and announced quietly as she walked out “let’s keep the toddler area to under 3” but did nothing to get the 7-8 year old kids playing there to leave. There were a LOT of big kids playing in the toddler area, and not watching out for the little ones who belonged in the area. Half the kids didn’t have wristbands or a sticker on their back to indicate they paid…\nWe won’t be going back."

The only staff were the ones selling the tickets, wow \"great\" safety! And as soon as we get in we see so many little kids running around and being reckless while their parents are talking away doing nothing. So packed to even find a spot to sit down. We see so many snotty nose kids picking away and the whole place smelled like pee and poop like a McDonald's play place. Do not go here if you don't wanna get irritated."

Their are a bunch of crawl spaces, tunnels, and slides to slide down, climb, and move around in. I'm definitely going back, and we will be regular. I believe that during the weekdays, the cost per child is $5.50 toward the end of the day, and the weekend is $8 (supervising adult is free). There are signs that everybody must wear socks for hygiene, safety, and to protect the playground, but because the staff does not monitor carefully, there are some parents who disregard the signs and have a lack of respect and courtesy for the facility guidelines, so you will see them wearing shoes."

Then he comes back saying, \"There was a big guy, he was scary!\" Seriously, people, let your kids explore on their own. They don't need you on top of them!

We went to the section for smaller kids and it was taken over by older kids, climbing the tree and blocking the tree with the huge benches. I sat and watched one older kid get stuck in the tree and scream for a good minute for his mom because he was stuck in the tree and mom was stuck on her phone. Another parent had to help this kid. I literally walked by and saw all of the parents glued on their phones while their kids are running into other peoples children. What happened to safety? And keeping an eye on your kids?"

          "content": "My 2.5 year old and I visited today and after having not been there in a year, I was really surprised at how filthy it was and how it's not being cared for. You can see an inch of dust under the equipment (especially under the slides on the right side), and the dust bunnies are floating around the room. I felt like my eyes were itchy and we didn't stay long because of it.\n\nAs others pointed out in their reviews, this place STINKS and they need to figure out why. Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.\n\nMore ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.\n\nI'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum."

There two rooms in side which are  rented out for birthdays parties. The reason why I gave 4 ⭐️ only is because the restrooms should be kept clean and because since there is only one restroom, the lines are very long. Other than that, it’s a great place for kids to release their energy.\nWhen my girls got home, I bathed them and they were asleep literally 5 mins later. I love this place. This place is the girl’s new play place. I definitely recommend it."

Price was reasonable for a two hour window and ten wristbands. It's hard to keep an eye on kids the whole time, but having one entry/exit makes it secure at least. And overall kids seemed to get along quite well throughout the play area.\nNice separate area for the little little ones. Hope to visit again when it might be a little less busy"

We didn't have to worry about any unsupervised kids. Door is heavy enough to where if a kiddo did run off, they wouldn't be able to exit. & the place isn't big to where you feel overwhelmed. You can see your child from any location in the room.\n\nThe place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well, no odors or messes. Bonus points for the rubber flooring that makes falls easier to handle. & the couches placed throughout so parents have somewhere to sit. Offially our favorite local indoor place for the littles. Safe. Fun. Friendly."

It's designed for parents who also have an infant to care for, as there a whole corner just for tinies that includes a rocking/nursing chair!! There's a little area for crawlers so that they don't get trampled. There are FOUR big, comfy couches around for the adults, flooring is totally padded except for the kitchen area. THEY STOCK THE BATHROOMS WITH DIAPERS AND WIPES. That's unheard of. Decent vending machine, sink, coffee machine, drinking fountains, cubbies for shoes and coats. $14 for one kid, good for the whole day."

There were only two tables so when both were occupied with other parents working/reading, or storing their food and stuff, we unfortunately resorted to sitting on the floor to eat until a table opened up. Overall, this is a quality place I would return to in the future for my little ones."

Lots of dangerous things such as the back door could very easily be opened, no bumpers on doors for finger protection, the metal grates in the doors are sharp and fingers could get stuck in them. We found toys with small pieces that young ones could choke on. The thing that I noticed was how toxic everything is. The chemical smell from the plastic is obviously not safe for children to be exposed to.\nI probably wouldn’t pay to come back."

Once inside, we stowed our shoes and then it was off to all the amazing different areas to do. If you forget socks, there’s a vending machine for that.\nThe facility was clean and had a great layout. We first hit up the bouncy floor then the slides and tire swing and everything else. The girls favorite was the ninja course.\nThe 4 year old biffed at one point and needed a bandage. There’s a kit available with ample supplies for that.\nIf you bring kids that are still in diapers, there’s a double changing room that is not in a bathroom.  Whether the kids are chaperoned by a man or woman, anyone can utilize the space at the same time.\nIf you want to host a party, there are two separate rooms that can be reserved.\nThere’s also a nice area with tables to take a break and have food that you can bring with you. There are also vending machines if you just need a snack.\nI highly recommend and the girls do too. We were all exhausted by the time we got home."

There are play structures for little babies and bigger kids, giving a wider range of options. The open field area is such a fantastic idea, too!\nYou are expected to clean up after yourself and they give you the cleaning supplies needed to. I love this feature. The bouncer trampoline thing is such a great addition.\nWe are here an average of 1.5 hours, which makes it worth the trip, and the price of a ticket per child.\nI highly recommend going!"

          "content": "This is a really nice indoor playground in Woodbury. There are two play structures with slides and climbing walls/ladders, a big swing (like a tire swing, but more a disc than a tire), a fake turf area with soccer balls and hula hoops and cones, an obstacle course area, a two and under play area, foam building blocks, and a big \"pillow\" for jumping. There are also places to take a break, including a reading room and nursing rooms. My 2.5 year old was done after about an hour, but my 6 year old could've stayed all day. I'm glad that you can go in/out with your code and there's a pretty large area to sit and eat. I was able to take my younger child to Culver's while the older one stayed with a grandparent and we ate our food and then played for more time.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that there are no staff there. When we were there today there was a kid who pretty clearly was just dropped off. He couldn't have been more than 6. He was an absolute menace. He was pushing kids and throwing their foam blocks and yelling at kids and adults alike. I encountered this kid in several different areas and he never had anyone with him. I just wish there was even one person on site to report these kinds of things to. Kids shouldn't be abandoned at an indoor playground for who knows how long, and without staff on site there's nothing stopping people from leaving their children there unattended. I hope that kid is ok."

          "content": "I had a mixed experience at the facility. While there were several engaging features, I noticed some areas that could benefit from improvements to ensure a safer and more enriching visit for everyone.\n\nOne of my main concerns was the bouncy pad. It appears that if children cannot easily reach the higher, air-filled section, the pad becomes flat and potentially dangerous. Unfortunately, my daughter slipped there, resulting in a minor injury to her head and nose. This design might need reevaluation to ensure that all children, regardless of their ability to reach the top, remain safe.\n\nAdditionally, the selection of building blocks was somewhat limited. For children who enjoy creative play, having a wider variety of building materials could greatly enhance their experience. It also seemed that sharing was not as encouraged as it could be, which sometimes hindered cooperative play among the kids and parents present.\n\nThe baby area was modest and felt a bit underwhelming compared to the other zones. Enhancing this area with more engaging, age-appropriate activities might make it a more attractive option for families with younger children.\n\nThe ninja area had potential, but I observed several instances of unsupervised children lingering after falls, even though the rules clearly specify that parental supervision is required. Strengthening the oversight in this area could help maintain both safety and the intended flow of activities.\n\nGiven the price of $12 per child, I felt that the overall experience did not quite match the cost. Unfortunately, based on my visit, I don't plan to return."

There aren’t regular staff on site, but did see a woman regularly cleaning equipment.\nIt was a nice space to be on a cold winters day, but really geared towards younger children. Went with another mom & her children and the 2 oldest of our group of 4 kids, were only occupied by a few of the spaces. This is a one level facility, so don’t expect climbing areas, there are none. Their feedback was McD’s playland in CG is “more fun”.\nThe bathrooms were clean and spacious, there’s a great locker/cubby area for all your outerwear/shoes and they allow you to bring snacks/water bottles etc and provide a really nice picnic area to eat. Overall very nice for K and under I think, based on feedback from our group."

The main difference is that there is not a basketball court like the Eagan location.\n\nOverall, the facility was clean and orderly.  When we were there, the net around the field was damaged on one side. It's not a huge problem, but it does need to get fixed.\n\nThe Ninja course did have kids climbing all over it. My daughter had a tough time playing in this area  due to the number of kids on the equipment. Would not be as big of a problem if the rules were being followed.\n\nOther than that, this is a nice place to bring the kids for some activity when the weather is not nice."

The concept of the park is great but we won't be returning and don't recommend it for families with young toddlers/infants. We went to the Woodbury location on 12/13/24. Although there are signs with rules everywhere we saw too many people not following them. It made us feel uncomfortable. There were two bigger boys (unsupervised) tossing a football on the bounce pad with lots of little toddlers around. My son is 1 and so I had to take him away in case he got hit by the ball. Every single time my son wanted to play with the blocks in the blocks area there would be 1 or 2 kids playing with ALL of the blocks. The second time we tried playing a grandmother told me her grandson was playing with all of them (there has to be at least 50 blocks there). I had to tell my disappointed 1 year old that he couldn't play because the kid wouldn't share. The dining area had food crumbs on the tables and floor. This is disappointing because cleaning supplies are provided and people still don't clean up after themselves. We won't return since there are no staff to regulate the rules."

My 12 year old had a blast running around with her younger sisters (6 and 8), but I’m not sure much older kids would have as much fun. The price is for all day and you can come and go as you please for that one admission fee. There are a few arcade machines and fun ride ons available for credits called “flames”. We bought 50 flames for $10, which my kids mostly used for the ride ons. It’s only 5 flames per ride. I don’t think the arcade machines are worth it, but they’re there if your kid really wants a little prize. Worth a visit!"

The birthday party meal package that we went with included pizza, cake, beverages, decorations, credits for games/rides, and goody bags. You're able to bring in outside food with the party so we brought a few snacks and sparkling waters for the adults. We (and our guests) were so impressed with the cleanliness and quality of the facility. The play structure is completely enclosed (so no intrepid explorers can make their way out of the play area) and can fully accommodate adults so the parents can get in to help kids when needed (or just to join in the fun). There is another play structure for smaller kids (toddlers in diapers and under) so there was something fun for all ages.\n\nWe chose a 10:30am slot on a Saturday and it was great for our ages 2-5. It wasn't too busy (started getting pretty packed by the time we left at 2:30pm) and the majority of kids in the structure were around that age. I felt safe letting my 3 and 5 year olds run free with less supervision.\n\nThe thing that really stood out was the professionalism and attention to detail of the events team that handled our party! They took care of everything and made sure we were having a great time. I highly recommend this place for birthday parties and we'll definitely be back on another day just to have hours of fun climbing, running, and playing in this awesome place!"

It was the first day of Spring Break and EID. Management needs to plan better staffing-wise around school breaks and holidays.\n\nA little while into our visit, the male staff found two young kids but could not find their adult. He carried them both around, trying to find their adult. There has to be a better way for staff to locate parents than this. With how chaotic it was, he could have easily tripped while carrying both of these kids and they all would have gotten hurt. Mom was eventually found, and all seemed well.\n\nA little boy hurt himself pretty badly (gash on his head, absolutely needed stitches). Thankfully, I had napkins at my table and was able to apply pressure while my husband told the staff to get the first aid kit, and the child's parents were found. About 30 minutes after the family had left, there was still blood on the floor next to my table. I walked to the counter (noticed a bloody gauze pad on the floor on the way) to let the female employee know about the blood on the floor and the gauze pad, and her response was less than desired. She cut me off before I could even tell her where the blood was by saying 'We are working on it.\" I tried to tell her that I understood they were working on it but I wanted to let her know the location, and she cut me off AGAIN with, 'We know, we are working on it.' (I never was able to tell her about the bloody gauze pad or the location of blood by my table)\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, the male staff member was walking around the sitting area with paper towels and a bottle of cleaner, not wearing gloves. I am not sure if he was looking for blood spots or was just doing some regular cleaning.\n\nWe left at 7:30, and the blood was still on the floor near my table.\n\nWe have been to this location before and had a great time. It was clean and the staff were friendly. Last night, they needed a minimum of two more staff members working for them to be successful."

My sister went to get an icepack and the staff gave us one that was supposed to become cold after cracking it, but the icepack never got cold. Then we found out the staff called an ambulance without seeing what happened or talking to us first. When we asked for help directly they chastised us for not having left already. Absurd and incredibly unprofessional behavior. It was all very strange and an avoidable situation. There was only one person working at the front when we came and the play area was completely unsupervised. I also agree with all the other comments. Overpriced, system was strange, was not very clean, and UNSAFE. We did take our son to the hospital and thankfully he was fine."

The staff didn't ask us parents anything, a few minutes later my son vomited, we think it was because of the blow, the staff came to say they didn't want to be rude but what were we doing? I was changing diapers and getting my son ready to go to the emergency room. Without asking us, she called an ambulance, we wanted to buy socks because my son soiled his with vomit, the socks they sell are not safe and have no grip, how is that possible in a place that specializes in children? That alone I recommend not going, but it is also very expensive for what they offer, you cannot bring drinks or food and you can only consume what they sell. We will never go back to a place like this."

And you can come and go throughout the day without having to pay more than once.  We went this past Friday and the place is still very clean, temperature controlled, bright and well cared for.  The one employee who was working the front noticed my nephew was crying and came over to see if he was okay because he had accidentally got kicked in the eye while on the \"spider web\" tower and asked if he wanted a sucker and an ice pack.  Only thing I wish they did have is wipes in the changing table to use to wipe the changing table.  The concessions stand is reasonable and the arcade card you can get is great ($20 for 100 points).  The kiddos love the bikes they can self drive.  I'm so grateful that this place opened in our neighborhood and is open throughout the year especially during the winter.  We look forward to returning in the future!"

Multiple times that we have been to this park, the equipment has been taken over by people looking 18+ years old. The equipment is designed for younger kids up to middle school, so people adult‐size make the park cramped and unsafe for children to play. The employees ignore any of this going on and let everything be free roam. Our younger child was almost crushed under a 6'2 probably 200+ pound person that jumped down the strap climbing area without looking at the 4-6 year olds climbing from the bottom. The soccer area which is about 20 feet by 30 feet in size was taken over by about 15+ of these adults that were wrestling and pushing each other and small children out of the way. There should be restrictions enforced for safety in a play area of this size, but there aren't any. This crowd shows up regularly as well as they have been there almost every time I've visited. My kids love the park but it feels too unsafe to bring them again after the incidents in our last visit."

They small pizza in Shoreview cost cheaper than they pj sandwich box  at kids empire.  Kids empire want last long at all. I wonder if the owner realize  they never busy and want last.

And the guilt associated when you are finding this out when you are standing there with your child or your grandchildren and you have to tell them because of how incredibly expensive it is that you will not be able to play there is incredible! - it almost seems like that guilt is counted on as it is really tough to tell your kids or grandkids that we have to go because you did not budget for the (shocking) amount  of money it costs to play there. That said,  if cost is not an issue for you, it looks like the place can be fun for the kids or Grandkids. **NOTE** We did not play there because of the high cost of admission - we found that Chutes and Ladders - also in Bloomington - is free and although it is outdoors, the Grandkidos had a terrific time and is one of their favorite places to play. Mind you, it is not a daycare, so a parent, grandparent etc. is best to stay and play for the safest, fun time!"

It's always clean and a safe place for kids. The app is super easy to use. It's great for your younger children. It hasn't been overcrowded any time I've been there. You can bring your own snacks, but they have to be left outside the play area itself. There are areas for that. Otherwise you can easily go for food elsewhere and come back."

I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day."

I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away. We will never be back."

          "content": "Visited Play Date recently for the first time, and I was very pleasantly surprised With the facility. I do think the cost for one day is a bit on the higher side when compared to other comparable play places in the Twin Cities; however, The admission ticket gets you all day, which is a big difference from most places that limit your admission to two hours. When looking at the pricing online, it would seem that the monthly membership is well worth the cost. There is also no admission fee for the adults, which is quite nice in comparison to some of the other places!\n\nThe play structures are very clean and well maintained. I loved how much seating there was for the adults. You could tell that a lot of thought was put into this place to provide comfort and convenience in all aspects. I really liked that compared to other play places there were less small toys. I find in some of the other places, the small toys create a huge tripping mass very quickly. I thought the emphasis on play structures was super nice, it almost seemed like an OT built the place. My kids had a wonderful time and have been asking daily to go back! We will be definitely purchasing a membership for the upcoming fall and winter!"

They’ve updated the party packages so even more was included in the base fee, with more add on options! Everybody had a wonderful time, and I can’t recommend this place enough!\n\nUPDATE: We had our son’s birthday party at Play Date! We had a great time, it was a perfect place to celebrate with friends! I can’t remember her name, but the staff person that was there was very nice and helpful. Reserving the space was a breeze, and they have multiple options as far as party packages. Will definitely have a party here again in the future!\n\nA nice, clean play area for kids! My two year old had a blast when we were there, he didn’t want to leave! So nice to have an indoor play area for kids in Carver County! The space was clean, as were the toys and climbing areas. And it was nice and open, so you could have view of your child from almost anywhere in the space. The only suggestion I would have, with winter coming up, is more coatracks for coats. We plan to come back again, so I hope they have an annual pass option available soon!"

The owner Heather is shockingly unprofessional and clearly doesn’t understand how to run a business. After I professionally requested a refund (for a 2nd time) instead of a credit via email after a misunderstanding she said I was rude and ‘never allowed back’? It was so strange. Not like I wanted to go back anyway after the struggle it was to be refunded, but it’s clear they care more about taking people’s money than providing a quality experience and doing the right thing without getting defensive.\nThere are far better places that actually value their customers. I hope Heather responds on here as dramatic as she was in her emails, and learns from this experience to treat customers better."

The climbing equipment is the perfect size for younger kids, and there is often something new added or changed (the playhouse with various themes is a favorite). Always clean & nice seating for adults. A good amount of space and activities for them to be entertained for hours, but small enough that I can keep an eye on both of them simultaneously. Highly recommend!"

It is fairly clean for the traffic it sees. No staff on site to periodically sanitize mouthed toys or pick up, and the water fountain is pretty gross. Saw a caretaker change a diaper on the carpeted play area. I can tell a lot of thought went into the set up of this place, but it was a disappointment for me."

The place just feels very warm (welcoming) and clean (including restrooms and well apportioned baby changing areas), and my kids didn't want to leave after 2 hours.  We were there from 3pm for a few hours and there were a max of four families at busiest.  The entry is very easy.\nI'd say it was high value for the money spent, and while there are cheaper options, my happiness level was higher and stress lower here than at a community center or large, grimy indoor playground.  Well done to this small, local business!\nWould recommend all adults and kids alike wear good socks."

As soon as we walked in and took off our shoes our daughter couldn't wait to check out everything this place had to offer! She had so much fun playing with the other little kids! This place caters to babies, toddlers and preschoolers and that's exactly what we were looking for! A fun, safe environment for our daughter to socialize with other children her age.

There are little nuances to the space that could be fixed up/changed to get 5 stars. The imaginarium train table tracks have been glued down to the table totally defeating the purpose of imaginary and creative play. Some pieces have been ripped off, making some unusable as well as ripping up the table. The hand dryer in the restroom does not work, i had to scurry around and check out the changing station where I was lucky to find paper towels. I would go again, just with lower expectations."

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).  We would go back anytime, but on a day when it was 95 degrees outside and you have a little one that wants to go to a playground, this place was a life saver.  We loved it!!!"

She called they said they don't offer gift cards. So then she came in. And bought a membership for me despite them knowing I had a membership she bought it the second membership. And it was a huge hassle totryy to fix it.\nThe no food policy is RIDICULOUS. it's all because they got mad that some family had a bday party in their picnic area. Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of \"only snacks\" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks? Idk The policy is ridiculous. And doesn't make much sense to anyone lol.\n\nThat being said it's still fun but I wish they'd re-evaluate the rule. And understand that not every family can afford their giant birthday package and private party room. And are just trying to make the best of what they can with winter birthdays"

People (adults / children) getting public benefits discount need to show management their enrollment cards in person (preferably before) the actual playdate since it gets sooooo busy.  Management will put person(s) on 25% off ($12 active individual AND $3 responsible adult).  Instead of paying $15 for two hours it'll be $11.25.  if your person has a waiver, be sure to ask for the waiver to pay for your membership.\n\nPlease remember this play space is for our loved ones who are adults w significant development delay.\n\nStaff say website explains 1/2 price admission for kids who receive any kind of financial assistance for their disabilities, but I can't find it?  You have to meet w their manager in person to explain why you need $6 off.  Who does this?"

Why not allow one free adult for every 3-4 child admissions? That's my only complaint. The annual memberships do not fix this problem for us as we live an hour away."

It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.\nIn short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips."

          "content": "Play area is great and generally well kept, customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday."

We were told we had to leave if we didn't toss the food. It was only later that I noticed a sign that said \"no meals\" posted above the sink. Seems kind of open to interpretation and trivial. We pay $30 a month for a membership and can't bring a sandwich and sippy cup of water into the food area? I understand if people leave big messes, but we weren't hurting anybody or anything."

It has multiple areas for kids to play and explore and is easily accessible and inclusive for different ages and abilities. The price for a couple hours is very reasonable and worth every cent. The facility was clean and inviting. We can't wait to bring them back here next time we visit.\n\nWe would love to have a facility like Boundless in the Northland, Twin Ports Duluth, MN / Superior, WI!"

One bathroom didn't have any soap.  The bathrooms only have air dryers but they need towels too.  Most kids strongly dislike the sound of air dryers.

The battery-powered toys were dead.\n\nLuckily, it was a big place and there were tons of things to do. The only issue I had was that not all parents supervised their children. They let their older children run around unsupervised. We were on the trampoline at one end with other little ones. There was a preteen boy whom I had seen earlier playing with his mother and three other siblings. He ran right up to my daughter and jumped, landing as heavily as he could two inches away from my toddler. If he had missed and landed on her, he would have hurt her. We had to take her off the trampoline. His mother was nowhere near him. I saw her in a different area with her other three children.\n\nParents, if you cannot manage your children, or if your children are not well-behaved, do not bring them at all."

So we moved some chairs to sat together as a group, the worker came up to us screaming to put the chairs back that we are not allowed to move them. It was so bad for me in front of my guests. So I emailed the owner right away, but I didn’t get any response back. So clearly they do not care. So DO NOT west your money here. Go Urban Air, best customer service and you get what you pay for. The only reason I had my party here, is because I have an infant and I thought here will be better but not."

          "content": "I do want to give my review to warn others trying to go.\nTo start off, the place it located in an odd place and was a little hard to locate. When you walk through the first set of doors you cannot advance further. Would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time online. Because trying to buy them on arrival is super frustrating. You are stuck between the two doors that are still the entryway, and so you have to stand there and order tickets while your kids are waiting to get in and other people are trying to get in past you. I tried 2 different cards online and it didn't work (which my cards worked fine before and after this place and have plenty of money)  So my friend had to use hers, and it worked. I look at my account and they charge my account four times and then charged it an additional four times for a dollar fee. It charged me four times and we never got any code.So my cards were working, but the website was weird. Then I see there's multiple refunds on my account while we are there. Then I all of a sudden, get 2 emails with codes 30 minutes later. What's someone else's name on it? Which doesn't make sense since I used my phone?So how was there someone else's name on my code. I went to run outside to grab a water and had my daughter stand by the door to let me back in. Since I didn't have the code and it was on my friend's phone. However, they have it so that you cannot open the door from the inside, no handles, which is a safety hazzard. And my daughter couldn't open the door to let me back in. My daughter had to run through and find my friend to give me the code. My friend even walked over to open the door but they have no handles on the inside to open the door for me. So I had to wait for her to find the code on her phone again for me to enter it. What she had to hold up to the glass so I could see to enter the code to enter in again even though we were already inside and had already paid. It doesn't appear that there's any staff there at all to help you. Kind of makes me worry that there's nobody there if there were problems. To add to that, I would say, the price is pretty high for what's there. The pictures online look much cooler than the place actually is and the pictures online are kind of deceiving. The cost to get in there is the same cost as urban air and urban area is much better quality. I would say the place is just okay, but honestly I think the admission should be about anywhere from $5 to $8. They have some cool features, but it really is just an indoor play set. I have been to other indoor playgrounds that charge a lot less. The signs everywhere are a little intense. At one point another boy hurt my daughter and her finger looked broken, I don't think it is but very swollen but there are no staff to ensure safety and that kids are not being too aggressive. Just so many odd signs, one of them being that it's a crime to enter without paying, which duh...  you should pay. But then even more signs in the two year old area that if you are able to read the sign that you're too old to be in this area. Which also a duh. But if there were some staff there to ensure rules were being followed, there wouldn't need to be so many signs. I don't know. Just overall, experience wasn't very good especially  trying to get in and the handle less door was not the greatest, priced too high, buying tickets in-between the outside doors with the cold was a little ridiculous. I don't normally leave reviews, but wanted to leave this because if I would have seen a review like this.I probably would have tried to go somewhere else.\n\nTo also add i tried calling my friend's phone and she didn't see my call and may daughter almost couldn't hear me through the glass door so I can to shout for her to hear me. If my daughter hadn't not been by the door and my friend never saw her phone I would have been locked outside for a long time. Which is also worrisome.\n\nMy 7YO and 6YO were bored in the first few minutes of being here i had to convince them to stay and try and make friends since we spent so much money to get in."

Very few places I feel safe to let my kids explore with worries of them running off or getting into something they shouldn’t, this place was such a relief! Coded access so everyone entering building in on file, so open and variety of things and burns so much energy before nap time . 12 hour access year round can’t bear that, instantly signed up for monthly after day pass. If you are on the fence, just try it!"

Our infant likes it too, but I don’t know that the price will be worth it once he turns one.\n\nThe bathrooms need some help. I changed a diaper in the family bathroom, only to turn around and see the sink was out of order. So I went to the women’s bathroom to wash my hands, only to find there was no soap. Thankfully there was soap at the sink in the seating area. I wish there was a phone number posted around the building that you can text if something needs attention. Then the owners can assess if it needs immediate attention or can wait until later. I’ve tried emailing in the past but haven’t gotten quick responses.\n\nOverall, I appreciate this place and what it’s provided for us, but wish it was better updated and maintained for the price we pay."

Balls in basketball and soccer field were very worn, but other than that the place was in very good condition.\nOnly issue was Massage chair charged me $14 and did not work, but chair company quickly refunded me after emailing them."

Plenty of better options in the north metro."

The maze is clean and well kept all be it, it smells a little like feet when you are in the maze but that comes with the territory.\nI was going through the maze with my son because there were far older kids in the maze. Kids do run around mostly unsupervised, so be prepared for disagreements and the spats that come with that but nothing out of the ordinary for children. All the children were mindful of my little one, so I was glad about that.\nThey have open cubbies for your stuff. No food or drink in the maze (for good reason), but they do have tables in a common area outside the maze where you can have a snack and clean up before going back in. Also please wear socks.\nAll and all a good experience, $6 per kid 1 and up. If it was closer to me, I might conder getting a pass to go."

I love that there is plenty of space for active play but there is also a quiet sensory room, two ball pits, and dedicated spaces for the littlest guests. It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored. We have been coming here since it opened and one thing that stands out to me is that Kirsten, the owner, is constantly making tweaks and improvements based on feedback. She is incredibly responsive and friendly. My boys (now 5 and almost 3) keep asking to go back!"

The play space is super fun and engaging for the kids and the room where you can have your food setup was perfect!  A little tight for 30 people but workable.  Kirsten is great to work with, very responsive to questions, and was at the ready to help us with anything the day of.  Highly recommend!"

Really enjoyed my drink, which I could sip while watching him play in a safe, fun enclosed space. I noticed they took extra care to make sure it was “childproof” even putting electrical covers on behind furniture. My only complaint is that I wish there was a play cafe just like this near my house!"

She lights up so many children's lives, including my daughter, and moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, nanny's, etc.!! She always takes the time to make sure everything is going well and willing to help anywhere she can. We love it here and have a 10 count punchcard that allows us to have access anytime we'd like to!  Thank you Peekabooboo's for lighting up so many little humans lives! :)"

There were crafts, snacks, gift bags, an egg hunt, and lots of fun & music with Bluey! Great selection of imaginative play toys and different ball pits to fit the needs of all age groups, from babies to toddlers! The calming/sensory room was very relaxing. Very reasonable and fair pricing. Plenty of places to sit while your children play. Make your way here today for a fun experience for all!"

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.\n\nThe drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!\n\nAt first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.\n\nThe owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.\n\nRight inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.\n\nTheir cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.\n\nThere is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.\n\nTheis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.\n\nMy husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.\n\nOverall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!"

I love the gift card/punch card option to receive an additional discount because I know we will use it ourselves and/or invite friends.  The sensory room is so wonderful for everyone and the party events she hosts are so cute!  She’s so tuned in on what kids enjoy and will switch things up to accommodate.  It was also a great place for me to meet a potential babysitter so I could have a safe place for kids to play, chat with sitter a little, and have them interact and play with kiddos.

For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit. Overall we had a great experience and the owner played a large part in that. I’m excited to take my boys back again!"

The facility is very clean & the owner is beyond friendly. She regularly checked in on us to see how we were doing, introduced herself & made an effort to connect with your child. It was a little packed but for a Saturday morning, it wasn’t too bad. There is a great variety of activities for kids of all ages. My three year old loved playing with the fire station & sensory bins, while the babies loved the play gym. We’ll definitely be back again this winter!"

My daughter crawled everywhere and enjoyed herself until it was time to close. Everything was perfect for babies and I been to few places and haven’t found a place I fell in love with and knew it was perfect for my baby. But this place was perfect for her and age appropriate. I drove 30 mins to go here and it was worth the drive. The owner was super sweet and nice. The environment was calm and perfect for a baby. This is the best indoor playground for a baby."

Our infant had fun crawling around on the green turf but there was a lot of small garbage on the ground from confetti pieces to bottle caps. I picked up and threw away what I saw. I'm not sure how often they clean the facility but it was dirty. Could use drywall patching and paint. There are things written on the walls along with big holes. There are cameras around the building so if there isn't anyone here maintaining it, then they should watch every once in awhile to see who's damaging things or misusing items... which is unfortunate when parents should be responsible. Some parents and their kids went barefooted as well, which is gross and not hygienic. They didn't seem to care about the rules when told. That's also a health hazard. The hand painted graphics are fun.  There's a little game area. A lot of tables to sit at. Not bad for an indoor play area but dirty with lazy upkeep and enforcement. There are other places cheaper and cleaner that offer the same thing besides the Kangaroo Jump/Blob."

They always have a blast, but this time was the first time I’ve seriously considered not returning given the cleanliness and safety concerns. There were some holes in the drywall exposing wiring that young children could easily pull out. These were in high traffic and highly visible areas. In addition, the play areas seemed extremely dirty. The floors in the age 2 to 5 playground area were especially gross. Dust, food remnants and who knows what were visibly evident. We were there about two hours, and I observed one person cleaning the tables and eating areas, but the play areas seem totally neglected and not kept up. Part of this is on the part of parents of especially older children who tend to run wild and misuse equipment. Nevertheless, I don’t think we’ll be back, which is a shame, considering we’ve enjoyed this facility a number of times over the past decade. For less money, you can have a better experience at Avery’s Adventures in Elk River for younger kiddos."

All but two hand sanitizers were just empty. The tanks for the purel were removed and not replaced. All the table wipe dispensers were empty. A lot of the toy vending machines were empty (worked out for me though) quarter machine was out of order. Many other food machines were out of order or just powered off, and the door handle to exit was broken off and swinging. The sink in the cafeteria area had a soap dispenser with soap loaded, but it was not functioning so there was a regular hand pump soap at least by the sink. Just so so so lazy. Please reload the hand sanitizers, wipes, and change the batteries in the soap dispenser!! I get the massive amounts of drywall damage in the play area, but the other above mentioned is such an easy fix."

They don't sell food (other than a vending machine).\n\nHard to find since there isn't a sign on the building."

For 15 bucks per child, I had mediocre expectations, which were absolutely not met. The entire place was absolutely disgusting and filthy. I took my daughter to the bathroom, and before we could see that the toilet had overflowed, my daughter walked into the toilet water on the floor. Luckily, I had a spare pair of socks  but we had to throw the ones we came in with away. When we sought out another bathroom to get cleaned up, it was out of the basics, no soap and dirty. Just to have one person on staff to do these basic tasks would be the minimum expectation for a place of this size. You can tell there is little pride in the space and the people have given up on maintenance and are just there to take your money."

No one was monitoring the play area or facilities either. We were there for 3 hours and I never saw an employee. I was in three different bathrooms with my kids and two were out of toilet paper and paper towels. There's a sign in the bathroom to text a # if the bathroom needs attention - I did text the number.\nOne plus is that they had toddler pottyseats in the bathrooms.\nThere's a sink in the dining area that also didn't have paper towels.\nThere were dents and holes in the walls all over.\nThe party room that we were in had one outlet and they couldn't get it to work (needed to plug in a crock pot for birthday food).\nThe playground and bounce pad were fun for the kids."

It is a warehouse converted into an indoor playground for kids typically 2-8 years old.\nYou will find a large inflatable air bag for kids to jump on, a large slide/playground (older kids), a small slide/playground (toddler kids), foam building blocks, an indoor soccer like field with various balls, and seating areas throughout the place. Oh, and Free WiFi for the adults!\n\nFood/Drink:\nThe facility offers a decent sized cafeteria area, so bring a small cooler with snacks. This area has two small TVs that allow you to pick up a sports score, but don’t expect sound.\nThere is one small vending machine with a few drink options and a couple of snacks for the kids, but don’t expect much. It’s basically stocked with animal crackers and juice boxes.\nThe are no microwaves on site, so plan ahead.\n\nBirthday options:\nThe facility offers two birthday rooms of equal size. Pizza seems to be the go to for these parties and you will see pizza delivered all day long.\n\nTiming: The place is open from 7am - 9pm everyday. I have found that it’s usually busy from 8am - 11:30am and then gets busy again around 2pm - 6pm during the weekends.\nI haven’t been through the week yet.\n\nOverall it’s a nice place to go on a rainy, cold, or hot day."

Also disappointing that he didn’t ask the big kids to leave the little kids area (yes, I know parents should, but they didn’t, so I wouldn’t thought he would’ve). Toddlers couldn’t play freely/safely because the big kids were running/jumping crazy all over the little kid area."

The vibe is kind of like nobody really cares about this place, they just care about making money with minimal effort.\n\nMy suggestion would be to limit the number of families who can be in the space at one time, and have families sign up for a 2 hour slot with breaks in between for cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing. Eg 9-11 slot, 11-1 clean, 1-3 slot. I would be willing to pay more knowing my son is going to a clean environment."

Apparently a St. Micheal catholic school did a field trip there that day and about 100 kids were packed into the party rooms. We had no idea they were there. My 2.5 year old daughter was bouncing on the big bouncer when the school suddenly let all of the kids out at once and about 30 older kids bombarded the bouncer. My daughter was suddenly being bounced feet into the air and flailing, crying and couldn’t get off. Parents, myself included, suddenly couldn’t let our children play on most of the equipment because there were so many kids from the school. This situation was entirely mismanaged by both the school and the management of playground plaza. I went into the office and told the man there I wanted a refund for the day. He didn’t argue and did give me a refund but did not offer up any sort of apology. Management should have closed the place to the public and called it a private event."

I only gave it 3 stars, 1) the cleanliness could be a lot better 2) wish there was a swing of some sort. A round sensory swing, and a baby swing would have been great. 3) the price\nIf the place was cleaner and there was a swing of some sort, the cost would definitely be explained."

Since we were the last late party (6-8pm) he allowed us to have the room until close at 9! He greeted us by name when we came in, he made us feel like family! Told us that he may not be there for the entire party but he’s only 10 minutes away and will be there for anything we needed! He ended up showing up at the end to clean the common areas. He’s just the best!! Thank you so much again, Mike!!"

I first purchased a day-pass to try it out, but immediately decided on a membership pass as my toddler and I loved it so much on our first trip there. It's a great place for your little ones to interact with other children. I've also had many pleasant encounters with parents. We'll be going here regularly! :-)"

Most places you get gross pizza or hot dogs and we were able to basically create our own party and still have an awesome place for kids to play. Prices are very reasonable and the party rooms are a great size. The doors lock behind you and nobody is allowed in without a code so it helps the stress of keeping an eye on your kids with other ppl walking in. I highly recommend this place."

So many options to keep a child busy, between the two different sized playgrounds, to the jumper/trampoline, the building blocks, turf for sports. Not to mention the giant lite-bright wall! Having the option to bring lunch/dinner with and eat at the available tables is amazing. And hey, you don't have to miss the big game, as there are a couple tvs to check-in on the Twins/Vikings :).  There are two party rooms available for birthday parties, and even when they are being used, there always seems to be plenty of space throughout the facility for everyone. Note to those using the vending machines: You really need to stick your hand/arm through the partition to get your items. Your purchased items don't just fall down like your typical vending machine. I've seen numerous people think the machine isn't working, when it really did provide the item, it's just you have to stick your arm all the way in the machine sometimes.\nThis is a great space!! I wish there were more locations!!"

It's a pretty good indoor playground, but it's very expensive. Also, just be aware that some parents (apparently) just drop off their 5 and 6 year old boys and don't stay, so if there are some kids without supervision being bullies and rude, that's why. For that reason alone, go early morning to avoid this problem."

          "content": "I have three critiques and LOTS OF GOOD THINGS about our experience, I'm going to drop the critiques first because lets be honest, that's why most of us read reviews.\n\n1. I really wish there was a large digital clock on the wall so I didn't have to keep pulling out my phone to see the time.\n\n2. The price - we gotta talk about the price since it is probably most people's hesitation to visiting. For the size of the gym and what they offer, the price is STEEP. Especially with all of the other indoor play areas in the metro area. A price like $18.99 per child, siblings discounted to $16.99 should 1000000% include same day re-entry. I feel like this is a total oversight and missed opportunity to gain a solid customer base in the area. **Worth mentioning that on Facebook, the pricing says it has changed to $15.99/child and $13.99/sibling, but the WRTS website still lists $18.99/$16.99. With tax, it was $17.33 for my son to play on 6/3/2025**\n\nNot to mention, the Monthly Memberships : 1 child for $250; 2 children for $300; 3 children for $380; 4 children for $450 is wild. You would have to go 14 times to even pay for the membership cost. This is another financial aspect that doesn't feel appropriate for the location based on what's also available for options nearby.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the Minnesota Children's Museum has daily entry of $16-19 and a YEARLY membership of $160-260. This includes three entire floors of play areas and experiences.\n\nI know that WRTS is new to the area and obviously wants to stick around for a long time, but having more accessible pricing would definitely make more families visit. The Little Village in CG has figured out the pricing of memberships perfectly for the area, IMO.\n\n3. Although having a mini store of things to buy is cool, it's like walking my ND kid into a gift shop and I was not expecting to navigate that upon entry.\n\nNOW ON TO THE GOOD THINGS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY!!! When asked how many stars my son would rate WRTS, he said \"infinite because this is the best place I have ever been to\".\n\n1. There was no unnecessary music playing! YAY!!! We were prepared with our noise canceling headphones, but it was such a relief that there was no music playing.\n\n2. The area had a vast array of swings, pretend play toys, a trampoline, a climbing dome, life sized building blocks, a massive Tetris and connect four and so many books.\n\n3. There are some tables in the entry area where you can sit and eat a snack or lunch if you packed them. They also have a vending machine with some items in it (my son is GF and I think there were only two GF items but that's better than none). We will definitely plan to pack a snack for next time.\n\n4. Accommodations in the bathroom for littles. A simple step stool and potty seat goes such a long way.\n\n5. A changing room for any size child.\n\n6. I know WRTS can't control their customer base, but every parent I spoke to while we were there was so kind and it felt good to be in a play area where other parents \"just get it\". It builds a kind of community that we all desperately need.\n\n7. I appreciate the fact that there were so many small pieced toys to play with (magnets, puzzles, etc), even though those would be a nightmare to pick up at the end of the day, its such a fun thing for the kids to play with while they visit.\n\n8. We have been considering a sensory swing for my son's room for a while now but we haven't been able to determine which one he wanted. After our visit, and his ability to test out all the swings there, we know which one he wants! It was an unintentional sensory swing testing area, hahaha.\n\n9. We were able to find toys that we loved that we never would have thought to try or buy before.\n\n10. There is counter seating at the half wall so parents could sit and watch their kids if they wanted. I didn't look to see if there were plug-ins at the wall to charge electronics, but that would be cool if there was. But also nbd if there isn't.\n\nOverall, my son can't wait to go back and we will return! I'm out of space to type anymore LOL."

I forgot his headphones but as soon as we walked in they had an extra pair. He went and started playing right away. He bounced around laughing and playing for two hours! I was so unbelievably excited to see him so comfortable. It was such a win for our family today. I’m truly grateful to have this resource. <3"

Which I love.\n\nI already have my kids signed up for summer camps, events, and their birthdays at WRTS Woodbury! As well as I purchased monthly memberships so we can come whenever we want. The price is well worth it!"

          "content": "I was excited to see that We Rock the Spectrum was coming to the Twin Cities after taking my son to a location in the Nashville area while on vacation. We left that facility with a very positive view of the company and were looking forward to taking him again.\n\nWe were only the second family to arrive early on a Thursday morning, and it was clear that the facility had not been cleaned the night before. The seating area was still full of crumbs. There were small toys scattered all over the gym as well, demonstrating that the floor couldn't possibly have been cleaned and definitely nothing had been sanitized. Also, no soap dispensers in the women's bathroom were functional.\n\nWe were most looking forward to the zipline, which my son got to try in Nashville and loved. However, I don't think the zipline setup at this location is safe. The lane of padding was too narrow and metal supports in the middle (where a child is most likely to fall off) had no padding at all. My son did fall off, bounce off the padding and onto the floor, and didn't want anything to do with the zipline after that.\n\nAlso, I realize that a fire exit is necessary and required by law, but the one here is very much accessible to any ambulatory child. Many autistic children, mine included, are practiced and efficient elopers. My son tried to make a quick exit outside with effectively no barrier to stop him.\n\nHonestly, the pricing at this place is also completely bananas. Good Times is $24 a month, Inneractive is $36 a month, and Eagle's Nest is $9 a day. Unless there is something specific at We Rock the Spectrum that your child really enjoys, you're much better off at one of their local competitors if you're just looking to burn some energy during a rainy day."

Today it was snowing outside and there were too many people at Good Times Park. Good Times Park is not the right fit for my son.\n\nMy son has autism, born with poymicrogyria, he is a neurodivergent child. He  kept on saying he wants to go swinging, it crushed my heart to see him smiling and so excited when we arrived at We Rock Spectrum. The owner gave me a free pass to go for the next time we return. I do appreciate it. But I think this kind of policy should be adjusted."

This location did not disappoint! The Woodbury location is HUGE, the owner and her family are wonderful people. I also have a young infant and loved the huge changing room, and ESPECIALLY loved the adult changing tables, which is something rare to find for a parent who has an older child still in diapers. There are so many activities to do for all ages from infants to adults with special needs. And the swings can hold up to 300 lbs, accommodating for larger children/adults with special needs. My kids' favorite thing was the zip line! They have a nice party room for activities and events. Theres also a gift shop and private rooms to rent out for therapies. 100% recommend and we cannot wait to go back the next time we are in town. :)"

The play space is one large open space, with one open door, so you can easily watch more than one child if you have multiples. There's a variety of things for kids to keep busy and quite honestly, keep adults entertained as well (or maybe it's just me who is easily entertained). My toddler had a blast exploring everything! My 5-year-old immediately gravitated to the space themed items."

If so I’d like to know so I can take the review down for the new owner.\n\nThe staff is rude. I had a monthly membership here and when I decided to cancel the system wouldn't let me. When I contacted the lady to try and cancel she wouldn't let me. She kept charging my card. When we disputed the charge (with email proof that we attempted to cancel) the credit card company refunded me. This prompted good times park to charge my card for the amount that was just refunded by the credit card company. That is credit cars fraud. The lady was belligerent and hostile in all of her communications with me. Would not recommend this place to anyone."

I noticed that some children were playing unsupervised, creating unsafe situations. For example, I witnessed a six-month-old child almost getting hurt in the designated baby area due to older children using equipment incorrectly and without appropriate supervision.\n\nI appreciate your previous response to my concerns, but it seems that the essential rules aimed at ensuring the safety of all children are not being adequately enforced. It is particularly troubling that enforcement appears to focus primarily on monetary transactions rather than the essential safety regulations that protect our kids.\n\nAs a concerned patron, I urge you to take immediate action to address these issues. If these safety concerns are not addressed properly, I feel compelled to share my experiences on social media and spread the word about the lack of safety at Good Times Park.\n\nMaintaining a safe environment for children should be the highest priority, and I sincerely hope to see improvements that would encourage me to return as a customer in the future.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response."

          "content": "This is horrible we are getting arrestedThe Good Times Park is a place that many people see as a sanctuary of joy, a place where children can play, families can bond, and laughter fills the air. It is a place full of colorful swings, slides, and the occasional sound of music playing from a distant vendor’s cart. For most, it is a space of happiness. However, for me, my experience with the Good Times Park has been different. It is a place where I often feel alone, reminded of the harsh realities of my life as an orphan, and of the mean lady who often makes my visits there even more difficult.\n\nBeing an orphan is not something I ever imagined would define my life. I lost my parents when I was very young, and since then, I have been in and out of foster homes. I never really had a place to call my own. The Good Times Park, with its bright colors and cheerful faces, was one of the few places I hoped to find a sense of belonging. I would often walk through the park, watching the other children with their parents, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of longing deep inside. I wondered what it would be like to have a family that would take me to the park, to share a moment of joy with me.\n\nYet, there is one person who has made it difficult for me to enjoy the park: the lady who is often there. She is an older woman, and her presence seems to cast a shadow over the park’s otherwise sunny atmosphere. She is the park’s caretaker, or at least, that’s what I have gathered. Every time I visit, she seems to be watching me with disdain. She never smiles or greets me like she does with the other children. If I get too close to the swings or the slides, she often scolds me, telling me that I shouldn’t be playing because I don’t belong there. Her words sting, and it is as if the park, a place that should be filled with joy, becomes a reminder of my loneliness.\n\nThe harshness of her attitude is even more difficult to bear because of the absence of my own family. When I see children laughing and playing with their parents, it reminds me of what I don’t have. I can feel the emptiness, and the lady’s unkindness only deepens that feeling. Her presence feels like an additional weight on my shoulders, as though I am being constantly reminded of my lack of a family and the cruelty that exists in the world.\n\nI sometimes wonder why she acts this way toward me. Perhaps it is because I am an orphan, a child without a place to call home, and she sees me as different. But the truth is, her behavior only adds to my sense of isolation. I wish that people like her would understand the pain of being without a family and the importance of kindness. The Good Times Park, which should be a place of joy and healing, often feels like an unwelcoming reminder of my struggles.\n\nDespite her mean demeanor, I try to find moments of peace in the park. I sit on the benches, watching the other children play. I try to lose myself in their laughter and the sense of normalcy that surrounds them, but it is never quite the same. My heart aches as I realize that my life will never be like theirs. I have no one to share these moments with, and the cruel lady’s behavior only reinforces that loneliness.\n\nHowever, I still hold on to the hope that someday things will change. Maybe the lady will be kinder, maybe I will find a family, or maybe I will learn to see the park differently. For now, I continue to visit the Good Times Park, though the experiences are bittersweet. The pain of being an orphan and the meanness of the lady linger in my heart, but I still try to find a glimmer of hope and joy in the moments when I can.\n\nIn conclusion, the Good Times Park is a place filled with contrasts for me. It is a space that should represent happiness and connection, but for me, it often feels like a symbol of my loneliness and pain. The lady, whose coldness hurts more than I can explain, is just one part of the challenge. As an orphan, I long for the simple pleasures that others seem to take for granted. While the park may never be the sanctuary"

If you have a chance to come here often the monthly membership would be your best option, after only two visits in the same 30 days it pays off and the rest of the month you visit “for free” :)"

Unfortunately my visit on December 24th was less than enjoyable.\nOwners/Managers need to be a little more hands-on when other guests have zero common sense. A group came in at 9:10am. Three 20 - 30 something men proceeded to run picks with a football in the soccer area. Then they went to the basketball area and the three played basketball for over an hour. It was so dangerous for the little ones that all of the parents and kids had to clear out for their safety. If that wasn't enough,  these three knuckle heads went to the bounce area for several minutes.\nSince people have no regard for others,  Good Times needs to step in.\nThese guys didn't pay to get in because they were with a group and felt they owned the place.\nVery frustrating that my 8, 6 and 2 year old couldn't enjoy their day off.\nI would have stepped in but these burly dudes were very intimidating and obviously didn't care about others."

No play area segregation based on the age. There is small area for kids below two years of age but rest of the area is common for all kids until 17 years. Just got my membership and cancelled it right away. Don’t want my kid to be traumatized. Good park employee just sits inside the room and watches the phone and doesn’t care what is happening in the play area. Atleast if the employee can let the bigger kids know not to run and watch out for others that would be great."

I have really appreciated the addition of online field trip postings because we definitely avoid those days. It can get busy and loud during those times, but that’s understandable. There are never field trips on Mondays and that’s great! They are constantly making improvements, most recently: new flooring in areas, more things in the baby area, and a ninja obstacle course. There is also a large eating area with high chairs which is great!\n\nI would love to see a baby/toddler wall seat installed in one of the restroom stalls because it’s hard to use the restroom when you are alone with a crawling baby. Also, a short toilet for young kids would be a huge help!\n\nThanks for providing a fun, clean, and engaging indoor play space!"

It does get scary sometimes, with some of the older kids kicking the balls too hard, but that’s why you must watch your child the entire time.

Everything looked to be in good condition in the play area, they just had multiple things blocking the entrance and a sign saying it's temporarily closed.

The thermostat said 64 degrees. The fridge open for a few minutes isn’t going to cool it down that much, as it was set to 64 degrees. We played here to be warm instead of playing outside, but I would’ve rather bundled us up outside honestly or brought a blanket inside, brrrrr. We still had fun, but definitely something that the business should be mindful off.\nAlso to add apparently they offered free drinks today, I was not aware of this and the worker did not offer or tell me. But she offered it right up to the next people who walked in, super odd."

          "content": "It’s a cute place for toddlers/small kids.  I brought my son two times in a one week and I noticed a few things I was not pleased with.  First is the price, ridiculous for one time, monthly whatever way you want to pay is not great.  They make you buy their socks the first time even if you have socks with grip… second is the cleanliness and the types of toys.  Dust and dirt everywhere.   Clearly a lack of cleaning overall.  Plastics pieces and foam were everywhere (choking hazard). Vacuuming and moping/spraying needs to happen everyday, everywhere.  The young teenage employees should be walking around and wiping stuff down not just sitting on their phones. Some of toys are dangerous for small children especially in the “doctors” area.  Flimsy plastic that could break and or too small for choking.  And yes, every kid puts stuff in their mouth even when you say no.  The desk in the “grocery store” is dangerous for fingers and sharp corners.\nLastly, it’s absolutely freezing.  They have it set to 64 degrees and the door is broken so when someone doesn’t pull it closed there is a bad draft."

          "content": "The first thing I have noticed about this place is that there were too many rules and alot of things were broken (including the front door). The staff seemed nice but not prepared for when special needs parents come in. I was not allowed on certain equipment and because of that my son did not want to participate on the structure. His favorite the ball sucker wall thing was his ultimate favorite. There were alot of signs that stuff was broken or not allowed to use. Average play places charge for the same cost with socks. I just found the membership outrageous. There are other places that have 10 passes for less than $100. They wanted almost $400 a month or almost $700 a year. You would have to make sure to attend every day to get your money's worth. The kids birthday party area is not ideal. It is very small. Would just recommend to come once in a while. I really liked the padding they used on all the equipment. That was the most appealing when I looked the place up online."

My husband would really like to join our son and I, but charging for another adult is a bit ridiculous and not family friendly. Another local play place similar to this allows for readmission later in the day for customers who visited earlier and I love this idea and could justify the cost more for this concept. This place is super cool, clean, and engaging, but not somewhere we could afford to visit often (even though we live right in town). Really hoping the business model may be tweaked in the future to allow more families to enjoy this treasure in our community ❤️"

Cute concept but definitely would love to see lower prices and not require the silly socks."

Due to my budget, I would say this, and the bathroom situation is the reason for the 4 stars.\nIt is a bit more expensive than some of the other places near, but the quality of the Playland is there!! I 100% understand the price! It's about $17 after tax!\nThe play areas seemed really clean and very well kept!\nThe bathroom - for moms with littles that can open doors, the bathroom is dangerous. If you're in the bathroom with them, they can open the door. If there could be a parent lock where kids can't reach that, that would make the situation so much better!\nAll in all, Little North Playland is so much fun!"

Adults are NOT FREE must buy socks to be in play area.\nHere are some tips. ........\nSnack & beverage bar available for additional cost. Ideal ages children (2-7). FILL THE WAIVER OUT BEFORE YOU ENTER the building. The seating/reception/party room area is not a large area. Seating options are backless stools or a few tables with chairs. Be prepared to carry around valuables or leave them out in the open. No coat hangers so if you can leave coats in the vehicle I would. Before planning to have a party, I would visit the location to see the space. Parking lot is shared with 2 other business but seemed to be enough. Temperature was warm so wear layers. Only two chairs for adult seating in play area, not many options.\nHope this helps!"

The establishment  would not let us use the bathroom unless you pay $2.50 for the socks to walk to the back Where the bathrooms were.   We had greatgrand parents in ther 80s who could not put the socks on so had to walk to the coffee shop. A father had his young daughter come to him who needed the bathroom but he was told he couldn't go back without purchasing the socks. You can't supervise you children unless you  purchase the socks.  I myself purchased the socks and was with the kids.  I multiple times witnessed the counter girl going to the back and snapping at the children for only one on the trampoline at a time, but you had to go across the trampoline to get to the foam pit. There is a big cone by the merry-go-round (Which never stops) with a hollow center that when the child goes head first into is totally unable to get out of and is now stuck in on there head. Had it been a smaller child they would have gone straight down on their head.  The toys in the clinic were brocken so when the kids put the audoscope to there face they could get cut. And i hope thet sanitizing the stuffed animal.  Also be prepared to bag and empty your trash can before you go. For a birthday party I give 0 stars. If you go with just your children it could be a 2 star."

My 4 yr old daughter was there and witness the whole thing and now she never wants to go back there it’s a playhouse for children the safety should come first of the children and that owner single out that 7yr old against a grown man"

I am sure I will be here everytime we visit at least once and can only wish we get one where we live! My only suggestion for the owner is to get sticky bottom socks to sell they are so worth it."

I appreciate that there is an area just for toddlers if she needs a slower paced area too. That being said, my FAVORITE thing about bringing my toddler here is that it is so clean! There are constantly employees wiping the structure down, using a Swiffer to clean the floor, and rearranging the toddler space to keep it organized and accessible. I'm not even super concerned about germs, it's just THAT clean! It is $20 for 90 minutes of play. It isn't a cheap excursion, but it is so so worth it! We love this place!"

Only downside was that I had to go wait in my care because the smell of the air fresheners is VERY strong and it made me super nauseous. Small space for so many air fresheners. It would be nice for them to open the door for some fresh air or get a natural air freshener like essential oils. We probably won't be returning due to the overuse of chemicals we have to breathe. Wish you guys the best of luck"

Not only that but the owner also went way above the call of duty and spent some time on the floor playing with our children, which as a very pregnant mom I was so appreciative of. We would make the hour drive from home just to visit again sometime."

It was a great way to relieve stress while my kid got his wiggles out. Great location and the perfect size so this tired mama can sit and see the little man and not have to chase after him the whole time. I wish they were still open in the morning at least once a week. It’s been harder to get there since the hours changed. I’d say it’s perfect for kids from when they are walking to around 6 years old."

The owner was present and took the time blowing up balloon animals for the guests which was very appreciated. The venue was clean and better in person than you can imagine with the pictures (to no fault of the owner). Reasonably priced as well compared to alternatives. I recommend giving this place a shot whether in Duluth, Superior or surrounding areas. Many thanks to Funland!"

There are also a few fun games for kids to play, like basketball and a small selection of arcade games—but what really stands out is how much they focus on getting kids active and moving their bodies, which is so important these days!\n\nBut the real gem here is the sensory room—we absolutely love it! It’s colorful, interactive, and so thoughtfully designed. My child could spend hours in there exploring and playing. The jump pillow is another favorite—always a huge hit and a great way for kids to burn energy.\n\nThis spot is perfect for birthday parties, rainy days, snowy days—really anytime you need a fun indoor activity. And to top it off, the owner is incredibly kind and welcoming. You can tell a lot of love went into creating this space.\n\nHighly recommend for any family looking for fun, safe, and sensory-friendly play!"

She (and my hubs, mom, and I) had an absolute blast here! There are a neverending number of toys, rides, and fun things to do, including an enormous Kangaroo Jumper (the \"hop-hop-crash\"), and it's an incredibly clean, bright, and welcoming environment for everyone.\n\nWe'll be purchasing a membership the next time our grandbaby visits, as it is an extremely cost-friendly way to entertain her at a place she loves!\n\nThis is just what Superior needed, and I'm so very glad they're here!"

Super Clean place, well organized & a friendly-and appreciative owner definitely made our two hour long (round trip) drive worth it!   We work with children so we know exactly what to look for in a setting to maintain safety, child development and encourage free play.  This “Funland” certainly met our expectations.   Age appropriate for crawling infants all the way up to our oldest kiddos- age 13.  (They were well aware to watch out for the “Littles” and they were also able to enjoy themselves)  Having rented the entire space for our “private event” was more than worth the price to have the evening to ourselves.  The party rooms, adult massage chairs work great.  The sensory room is ideal for toddlers & young preschoolers.  The bounce pad alone entertained everyone -of all ages our entire 2 hours.  We all agreed that not only would we come back as individuals but we will host most private events here as the set up was so perfect.  Thanks again for hosting us!  We are excited to return!"

The layout of the tables worked for our guests and the flexibility on decorations helped a lot. We had about 10 guests and they all loved it.\n\nWe even had an extra table just outside the room with a little area to do the gift opening. The price is very reasonable and the staff is great to work with (we even got a free gift!).\n\nI 100% recommend visiting here! Especially if you are looking for an easy place to have a birthday party. All of the kids had an amazing time."

I completely understand the need to close for private parties — it’s a great way to provide a special experience. But it would be much better if these closures were communicated in advance. It’s really disappointing to show up only to find out it's closed, especially when we could’ve planned something else for the day. My little one was heartbroken and cried when we couldn’t go in because of a private party.\n\nAnother confusing part is that the map and online listings show the hours as 9 AM to 6 PM, which makes us think it’s open. That adds to the frustration when we arrive and it’s not. Now, we feel like we have to call every time before visiting just to be sure. Clearer communication would really help families like ours plan better and avoid disappointment."

I was surprised how large the party space was and with the kitchen attached to it. We truly had a wonderful time and have heard so many good comments from both kids and parents. I was touched to see the coloring pages they added to the tables that went along with my party's theme. The staff was great!\nI would highly recommend planning your next birthday party with them!"

I got really excited when I first started reading and checking out the website, I thought I finally found a place for my son to be able to spend time at this summer. A place where he would be understood, would be safe and able to socialize while allowing me a small break.\nPart of being on the spectrum is every child is so different, some aren’t able be potty trained and some are. I wish there were places that were actually inclusive to the whole spectrum, not just claiming to be."

I rated it 4/5 as we had our son's birthday party and we were notified a week prior to the party on their restriction. The first 1.5 hours are in the gym and the last 30 minutes is reserved for cake/food and presents in the party room as they need time to clean up the gym and do not want kids eating and then playing on the equipment leading to them becoming sick. The website states, \"Access to entire facility for 2 hours.\" This is not true. We, all the kids, presents, decorations, and food had to be out by the five o'clock time. (our rental was 3-5) This lead to much stress. I also missed out on my son opening half of his gifts and thanking the parents for coming. . You are allowed 30 minutes to set up. 15 minutes would have been perfect and then 15 to take down and pack would have been better. In the end, we will not be having another birthday party here"

With a mission that boldly declares, \"Finally a place where you never have to say I'm sorry,\" this gym is truly a haven for children of all abilities.\n\nMy eleven-year-old son and I spent a weekend exploring the sensory-friendly activities offered at We Rock the Spectrum, and it was an experience that left us in awe. The gym boasts an extensive range of equipment, each thoughtfully designed to cater to various sensory needs. From suspended swings for balance and vestibular treatment to crash mats and pillows for fun, motor planning, and strength, the gym has it all.\n\nOne standout feature is the zip slider, providing stress release and promoting joint and body relaxation. The trampoline offers a fantastic opportunity for building leg and core strength, while the indoor play structure enhances climbing skills and playground expertise. The inclusion of sensory-based toys and equipment is a testament to the gym's commitment to improving auditory processing and fine motor skills.\n\nWe Rock the Spectrum goes beyond physical activities, offering a fine motor and arts and crafts area that aids in improving hand-eye coordination. The calming room, designed for regulating emotions and reducing negative sensory input, is a thoughtful touch, providing a quiet space for children to find balance.\n\nDuring our visit, my son, although initially overwhelmed by the new environment, showed genuine interest and enthusiasm. Despite not lasting long during our first visit, he expressed a desire to return—a testament to the gym's engaging and accommodating atmosphere.\n\nNot only did our time at We Rock the Spectrum provide a fun and inclusive experience, but it also offered valuable insights into new equipment that can benefit my son at home. The gym's commitment to inclusivity and overall awesomeness earns it a well-deserved 10/10 rating. We Rock the Spectrum is more than just a gym; it's a supportive community that understands and embraces the diverse needs of every child. I highly recommend this extraordinary space to families seeking a place where their children can play, grow, and thrive without limitations."

I saw several times older children playing very Rough between the ages of 12 and 14 at no time were they told to be careful. In my opinion, they should set safety rules. There are several small children and some others with some condition. You should be more attentive, an accident could happen. No person is in charge of security."

My kids' favorite part of the playground was what they dubbed the \"carwash\" which was kind of like a ninja maze (pictured). There is a nice indoor waterfall area outside of the playground that my kids enjoyed as well.\n\nDownsides: no food at the tables, though drinks are permitted. If your kid is timid and wants you to go through with them the first few times some of the crawl spaces are extremely tight for the grown-ups - wear your workout pants! A lot of the crawl spaces are very dark, which my kids didn't prefer. The bigger slides are super fast compared to most playgrounds we frequent (indoor or outdoor) so the kids only went down the big ones twice. We still managed to be there for almost three hours, so obviously it's not terrible."

It IS hard to keep track of where your child is in here, as most of the structures are low visibility. Everything is roped/gated off to try to prevent any leaving, but the desk where you check in was not paying attention to much more than their phone.\nThe issues I had: parents were NOT watching their children and no one was enforcing the rules (no running, screaming, rough housing). Many times older kids would come chasing each other, literally screaming, and it scared some of the younger children and made it hard to enjoy. Most parents were sitting to the side on their phone or computer. I wish there was more enforcement and accountability on staff and parents end of things to make the park enjoyable for all visiting. I wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone under 3 (most were school age kids there running)."

They have lockers and cubbies for you to use. You can bring snacks and beverages as long as it's at the tables. The best part about this playground is that it's inside the Woodbury library and has a nature center area. I've never been to a place that has so many things to offer at 1 location! Also, you have to check out the waterfalls inside! They're are beautiful and peaceful.. This is a wonderful place to have  lunch, business meetings, remote working, or just a peaceful place to read. The best part about the park is that parents are free and the kids are 5.50 per child. We took 7 kids with 3 adults, and it was a wonderful time! We definitely will be back soon! Thank you so much for the opportunity to visit this beautiful indoor playground for the kiddos."

Well, except to have snack and drink a few times!  😉 It's really nice to have a place to bring kids rain, snow or shine!  It's a clean facility and reasonably priced!  Best of all, all of the kids they met quickly became friends to add to their fun!  Very Encouraging, given these Pandemic times!"

The girl (taller, short hair blond) is not the friendliest; she barely wanted to take my money.  Stuck out her hands and took the bills with two fingers as if they were contaminated.  She left them on the countertop even after I had left.  This is my first time here with my boys because we live close by, and will probably be my last.  This experience leaves a bad taste.  I do not recommend this place if this is the customer service offered.  Clearly there are signs that say no food or drinks but the front desk staff is eating a cold sandwich.  Other patrons who came later brought in outside food as well."

The main passage to enter the area HAS to pass that area and hear the noise. After 20 mins he wanted to leave.\n\nI think it's a great space for most kids. If your child is sensitive to loud noises, may not be the best place to bring them.\n\nSecond it gets really warm inside to dress your child appropriately."

The other time we paid for mini golf ahead of time with the female staff member but weren't given a receipt. When we returned later to play, the male staff member questioned if we had actually paid. There are ample other places to visit in the Twin Cities that are better options."

The only thing I would mention is the ball canon was very loud and most of the kids had to cover their ears. Other than that, great place for a birthday party!!"

I was super grossed out here...It would be stretching for this to even be a free place to go. Everything is so warn out and grubby and in bad shape and feels unsanitary. It's kind of like a bunch of garage sale items that should've been thrown away instead of sold, all compiled together. Most material is so warn down you can see the insides. The germs and junk from the wear and tear has to be just caked into every crevice there. Honestly the whole thing needs to be completed gutted and redone. There is a strong chemical smell upon entering - like a bad cleaning agent - almost like kitty litter chemicals. The chairs available for parents to sit are so sunken and low and hard and you can't see your kids from the sitting area. There are so many enclosed places for kids to hide that it's a recipe for disaster as far as keeping your kids safe. We immediately washed all of our clothes upon returning home and felt like we even needed showers. Hard pass for me, there's many other play places in the general area that are much much better at the same or even more affordable pricing."

When I get there their was a lady she ask me to pay and she put stamp on their hands she never mentioned anything about waver to sign this guy shows up and ask me if I signed it. I said ‘NO’ he goes off saying why why I can call the cops. How is that my responsibility and how would I know when nobody mentioned it. O ask for the manager he said he is the manager.\nI can not believe they treat their customer like this he star recording my kids and my car and my kids asked me why is he recording Us.  I put them in the car and I call the police and reported him. We was there only for 1hr we spend close to 100$ and this is how they treat us.\n\nI do not recommend this place."

Also the area where customers keep there things (cubbies and lockers) were very dirty. I understand it’s winter but the cubbies appeared to not be cleaned in a long time. And the odor from all of the lockers (where I had to keep my son’s diaper bag) was foul. Again I love this play place and will try again in the future, but if things don’t start being cleaned/ repaired I don’t see how it can remain safe/cleanly for children"

And finally my biggest concern is that there is NO outside food/snacks are allowed but yet, they only sell junk food. I understand this is a small business and they want us to support them by buying their snacks. However; We are strictly don’t do chips or junk food for our kids. Only fruits, vegetables & water is our usual snacks. Therefore, we have to leave after an hours & half. Try eating in the car but it’s uncomfortable. Finding a place is a bit challenging for us due to our diet & lot of fast food around here. We ended up just going to a friend house and ended up not returning. It’s an awesome playground but will not be coming back. I found it’s inconvenient as a parents and for lot of parents especially if you bring more than 2 kids. Driving back and forth and parking are limited."

It's a cool place to visit, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have little littles."

It was very clean with a nice seating area, plenty of counter space for food, and tons to do for the kids. We had kids ranging from 1-9 and they all had a blast. We also loved that it was private and the whole place was ours for 2 hours- worked great for our son who is very shy with strangers, so he was really able to open up with just friends and family there.  The owner even got my son a dragon stuffed animal as a birthday gift. It was very well organized and we didn’t feel rushed out or unwelcome in anyway. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to host a party!"

The owner is super kind and helpful, and rates are very low for the extent of entertainment. There is a particular area for babies, tables for snacks or work, and lots of fun, interactive centers."

The owner or manager (not 100% sure) was very nice. I didn't have my military documents with me and she still gave me the military discount which I wasn't expecting. I plan to tell all of the moms I talk to and tell them how much fun we had. I look forward to going back soon!"
