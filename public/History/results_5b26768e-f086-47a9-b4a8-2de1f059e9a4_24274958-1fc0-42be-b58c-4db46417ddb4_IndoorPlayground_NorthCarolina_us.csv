It‚Äôs the perfect spot for kids to play freely while parents can relax a bit too. The staff is very friendly, and the overall vibe is welcoming and fun. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, safe play space.

Review: Such a cute spot for so much play! You can tell the owner really poured her heart into making this an interactive play area while incorporating so many local touches from the area. This is very different from the play cafe that is downtown morehead in case anyone was wondering!
Toys and environment were clean. Lots of natural light and something for
all ages. Especially love the size of the area for the crawlers/littles. We will be back often! Great addition to town.

Only constructive criticism was for the ice chest in the grocery, those ice cubes traveled far and I found a few in the littles area. Those are a major choking hazard so I turned them into staff for sanitation to make their way back to where they belong. Just do your part as the parent (self explanatory) and you‚Äôll be fine. Everything else was fine!!

You‚Äôd think with all the covid concerns that cleaning a Children‚Äôs play area would be on the list of things this base cares about but clearly that‚Äôs not on the list of priorities.

Review: The indoor playground is very clean and nice. However, we had to leave early because the bigger kids were coming into the toddler section. They were picking my baby up and moving him around, taking things from him and running by him. It's not the facilities fault but I do wish Parents would keep a closer watch on the bigger kids.

Review: A great little spot to take your little ones!  They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

Review: Great place for my 3 year old. Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.

Our 13 months old totally loved the playground.
The owner and her daughter are great, kind and respectful. Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.
The space is clean and it‚Äôs got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.
So thankful we found this place.
We will be back üíô

Review: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Their favorite thing was the dinosaur room and the playground. Atmosphere was relaxing was not crowded today. I like that i can bring my own food for them they do have a cafe there as well. 10/10 recommend.

Review: Super fun! Great relaxing place to let your kid(s) run around without having to tell them no every 5 min. It‚Äôs a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.

Saturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.

I wish there were more gates around doors here though, I‚Äôve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.

My only criticism is that the music is a bit louder than it needs to be. The volume mixed with kids playing and yelling is a bit much. Also, maybe play children‚Äôs songs!

Review: My son (3.5) has a blast here!   They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

Review: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: Such a cute spot for so much play! You can tell the owner really poured her heart into making this an interactive play area while incorporating so many local touches from the area. This is very different from the play cafe that is downtown morehead in case anyone was wondering!
Toys and environment were clean. Lots of natural light and something for
all ages. Especially love the size of the area for the crawlers/littles. We will be back often! Great addition to town.

Only constructive criticism was for the ice chest in the grocery, those ice cubes traveled far and I found a few in the littles area. Those are a major choking hazard so I turned them into staff for sanitation to make their way back to where they belong. Just do your part as the parent (self explanatory) and you‚Äôll be fine. Everything else was fine!!

Review: Amazing spot for kiddos of basically all ages, mostly geared towards 2-10 year olds in my opinion. I have been looking for a place that my 2 and 8 year old can be both entertained by equally, and I have found it! Almost 3 hours of fun and they still didn‚Äôt want to leave. I appreciate the variety of activities and all sorts of paces. Art room, calm room with low lights and books, a zip line, trampoline, dramatic play area, and tons of swings. They‚Äôve got snacks and a gift shop. Only thing: beware of the classroom they have that releases their kids @ noon, it can go from being real quiet to a mad house in a matter of minutes (don‚Äôt worry they leave by 12:30 üòâ)

Vanessa made planning the party easy and she was very helpful - both in planning and the day of the event.  She went out of her way to make sure every child had a wonderful experience.

After an autism diagnosis with her fourth child, she wanted to create an inclusive environment that can support ALL children in a safe and fun space! Vanessa and her husband Mark opened up We Rock the Spectrum right off Hendersonville road in the Turtle Creek shopping center in South Asheville!

Our daughters Sydney and Riley went last night for Parents Night Out and they can‚Äôt stop talking about it! The indoor zip line and the trampoline ‚Ä¶ big hits! Also, pizza, popcorn and a üçø movie!

Support their awesome local business if you can! It‚Äôs for all kids! She even has a pre-K prep program led by a certified elementary school teacher with a Montessori philosophy!

Review: We are going to love having this nearby! We went for the first time over the weekend with our neurotypical 22 month old and she had a blast. Call ahead of time because they are currently only allowing a small amount of people at a time. Everything was clean, masks worn by all adults, and so many different fun options for the kids. There is something for every kid here! Pretend play section (grocery store/kitchen/baby dolls), various swings and ziplines, things to climb on, a springless trampoline, puppet show, a calming room (which our girl seemed to enjoy), an arts and crafts room, and so much more! Prices are very reasonable.

I hosted my son‚Äôs birthday last month with an Optimus Prime Transformers theme, and the team was incredibly helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the entire experience. I was so impressed that I referred a friend for her sons‚Äô birthdays (ages 1 and 7), and once again, the staff, venue, and overall atmosphere exceeded expectations. I will definitely continue recommending this location to others!

Every time something is broken they fix it immediately and you constantly see someone cleaning. Not to mention the healthy snack choices and the great coffee. Always a a joy to be here

Review: Went here for the first time with my girls who are 5 and 3, we were going to do a trampoline park, but I thought Playland would be more age appropriate, and I‚Äôm glad I changed my mind. The highlights for my girls were; the ball pit/slide, the kid cafe, the spin tops, and the big middle slide. While seated I did see numerous employees sweeping, wiping tables, and checking the bathrooms. My husband and I enjoyed the sweets they had to offer. We tried a crepe and the Oreo waffle, they both were good!

Review: Our children had fun. As adults we were really uncomfortable as one of the staff literally watched our kids and said something to them every time they did anything but he wouldn't say anything to any of the other kids not following rule. He would literally walk past them to come say something to my son and nephew. I found this odd as we were the only black family there.  I probably won't go back. It is fun for kids but not for my kind of people....

As I stated yesterday we were made aware and the kids only went in there once. There were tons of other kids at the same age but of a different race in the toddler area and the guy seen them. He only said something to our children because we were the only black family. And to keep from taking ownership someone who wasnt even there gets on here and tries to paint my children as the bad guy but wont tell you how my children helped the guy clean up as the other children played wild and out of control. My son also had another child flip him the bird. Parents bring their kids here and don't pay any attention once they get there.

Review: My son is Autistic has sensory issues, so I was spinning him on the spinning seats in front of the toddler area and beside of the ball pit, he was laughing, smiling, and sitting with his head back against the padding looking up at the ceiling while I spun him. A worker came up to us, while we‚Äôre actively playing, and told us that we needed to stop because he is ‚Äúspinning too fast and looks like he‚Äôs going to start gagging and be sick!‚Äù Okay, while I appreciate the ‚Äúconcern‚Äù I know my child, I‚Äôm actively playing with my 3yr old who LOVES spinning and sensory play. I could understand if my son was screaming, crying or standing up while spinning.. something OTHER THAN laughing and asking and signing for ‚Äúmore spinning‚Äù.. He begged me to spin him more after something was said and I had to explain to him that ‚Äúmommy can‚Äôt spin you anymore‚Äù he got so upset he asked to go home.. He is THREE!! A three year old, or any child, should not have experience discrimination..I have friends who have had similar experiences with their children whom aren‚Äôt neurotypical.. This place is NOT inclusive for those with intellectual disabilities and I will be filing a formal complaint.

The front desk worker said, ‚Äúparents need to watch their kids‚Äù. I‚Äôd feel better going once she‚Äôs older but there‚Äôs no point in having a toddler area if that‚Äôs not enforced.

Review: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that‚Äôs intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out‚Ä¶. I walked away‚Ä¶ about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife‚Äôs mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn‚Äôt melt. All this to say, if you don‚Äôt pay the 200$ for a party, don‚Äôt take any food or drinks‚Ä¶and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don‚Äôt ask if you can bring anything in‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably get talked about like your a criminal‚Ä¶ total of 150$ spent here.

First time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn‚Äôt help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn‚Äôt put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.

Then wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn‚Äôt wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm super clean I can‚Äôt let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!

Then I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!

Would I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn‚Äôt happy

That broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent

Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.

Review: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.

Review: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.
They had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.

Review: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The ‚Äútoddler area‚Äù gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn‚Äôt get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you‚Äôre going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.

Review: This place is just THE BEST. We've brought our now 2.5 year old here for the past year whenever we are in  town visiting and he loves it.  The ball pit, maze, giant slides, and trampolines are fantastic, and the downtown Salisbury street with the shops that kiddos can play in is a cute addition. Staff are super friendly as well.

Review: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.

Review: If they had a zero I‚Äôd leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don‚Äôt fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don‚Äôt even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn‚Äôt let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I‚Äôm another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don‚Äôt tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you‚Äôre business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up

Review: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back üòä

Review: It wasn‚Äôt horrible but it wasn‚Äôt great either. This was the second time I‚Äôve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It‚Äôs not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.

Review: Really wanted to like this place - it's decorated really cute and has lots of fun things for kids to do. However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.

Review: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn‚Äôt expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol
This was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.

Review: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù event‚Ä¶ this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter‚Äôs wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to ‚Äúsit down and have a special snack‚Äù that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn‚Äôt tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren‚Äôt even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.

Review: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don‚Äôt know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn‚Äôt take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn‚Äôt have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.

Review: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the ""reserved"" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the ""manager"" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.

Review: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.

It‚Äôs one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents

Place is priced perfect‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the biggest but it‚Äôs not for older kids‚Ä¶The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It‚Äôs injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry‚Ä¶

The food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven‚Äôt seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child‚Ä¶

Review: Pleasantly surprised by this nice clean indoor playground for kids. I took five of my six granddaughters for two hours of playtime at approximately $81 for all six of us for entry.

It‚Äôs modern with plenty of areas for the kids to explore, climb, and play. There is a separate gated play area towards the rear to accommodate smaller children or little ones with disabilities. Plenty of seating for the adults is available near the Cafe or cubbies near the ball pit and other areas.

Don‚Äôt forget to remove your shoes on the playground and wear some socks! Call ahead to ensure it‚Äôs not closed for a private party or event.

Review: Visiting over the Christmas/new year holiday with our 5yr old. After 3 straight rainy days, we needed to get out and play. We googled and found Playland. 2hrs of indoor play geared for 1-10yrs olds for $16 is amazing!!! We don‚Äôt have it in ENC.

Highlights:
Clean/safe
Positive/chill atmosphere
Employees circulate and interact as needed with kids. They are positive and happy to see kids playing - not grumpy or bothered or constantly yelling ‚Äúno, don‚Äôt do that‚Äù. This really is a playground for your kid to let loose and enjoy climbing, jumping, falling, running, all the things. Seems like a family run place that really has put a lot of thought into how kids play and enjoy lots of diverse stimuli to interact around them.

My five year old played hard for 2hrs straight!

There‚Äôs padded benches, seats, and cafe tables. Lots of seating to supervise at a distance if your kid is at that stage. It‚Äôs also very normal to get into the space and play with your littles too.

*there is even a smaller play area that is gated for littles to get in if that‚Äôs your pace.

Didn‚Äôt try the cafe yet but many folks had hotdogs, waffles, coffees, grilled sandwiches, and yummy kids snacks. Sitting back with a cold coffee and chilling while kiddos burn their energy is a great business concept!

Only con:
I wish I could‚Äôve brought in our water bottles. Their sign says no outside food/drinks. There is 100% access to water fountains. In hindsight I‚Äôm sure I could‚Äôve asked if water was ok. Check next time.

Review: I used to really like this indoor playground ‚Äî it was clean, well-maintained, and felt like a safe space for my baby to play. Unfortunately, it seems like the quality has been slipping lately. Things are getting noticeably dirtier, and some of the equipment is starting to be worn down.

During a recent visit, I was shocked to find poop in the play area. I reported it to the staff immediately. While they said they would clean it, I was surprised there was no apology or even a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for reporting it. I made sure to clarify that it wasn‚Äôt from my child, and all I got was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok‚Äù.

Cleanliness and hygiene are critical in a space meant for babies and toddlers ‚Äî and so is a respectful, professional response when serious issues are raised.

Will not come anymore.

My 10 month old really enjoyed the baby/toddler area, especially the little carrousel. It‚Äôs nice that each location is different, but the coffee stays the same, delicious as always!

Review: It provides a highly engaging and entertaining environment for children, offering a diverse range of activities that effectively capture their attention. The two-hour time limit is sufficient and seems to pass swiftly due to the captivating nature of the activities. The materials utilized for play are predominantly safe, alleviating concerns for parents. Additionally, the presence of a cafeteria further enhances the overall experience.

Review: Probably my favorite indoor play place for my little ones. Whoever designed the play areas has kids and kids in mind. There's something around every corner for their enjoyment. Spacious (a plus). For us germaphobes, they clean and sanitize A LOT.
A separate play area for crawlers-3yo and a seating area to watch them. Everything is cushioned.
The eating area has plenty of space to camp your gear. Kid friendly food and snacks and drinks to buy. For adults, they make Belgian waffles and crepes and more. I did not look at the menu extensively for my first visit but saw many people chowing down.
I was really pleased with the experience and cost for value (2hrs, $15 per kid) and you get a punch card.
Pro Tip: Go online and fill out Waiver Form information before your first visit.
We will be back!

Review: By far the BEST indoor playground we have ever been to, designed so well and FUN for the kids. It is also gated and very very CLEAN!
My only feedback (for safety) would be to place a 1-kid limit sign or monitor the entrance to that stretchy climbing area, kids were running and jumping from the top clear bridge into the middle, falling through each tier and forcefully landing on top of other kids.

I also want to add that I absolutely loved the  Christian music they played while we were there, we will definitely be back!

Review: We visited Play Land, a playground advertised for kids ages 1‚Äì10. My nieces are both 10 years old, they are twins, but we were told they couldn‚Äôt play because they ‚Äúlooked older/they were about to turn 11 in 2 months and there were many younger children playing that day so they weren‚Äôt comfortable letting them play‚Äù The manager claimed the owners had recently changed the policy and that it was listed on the website‚Äîbut after checking thoroughly, there was no such information online or posted anywhere in the facility.

While the manager said she was just doing her job, the situation was frustrating and humiliating. My nieces were made to feel out of place and judged based on appearance alone, despite being within the stated age range. They were eventually allowed to play, but the damage was done‚Äîit was an upsetting experience that no child or family should go through.

Discrimination based on how a child looks rather than their actual age is not acceptable. Clear communication and respectful treatment should be a priority, especially in spaces meant for kids. We have been coming here for months and are truly saddened by our experience today. I understand there was most likely a situation that happened that put smaller children in danger, that the manager/owners started a policy of gaging whether a child was fit to play or not based on there looks, but I am appalled by the treatment we received by this establishment today.

Replying to owners response.

Thank you for your response, but the manager was not going to let my nieces play yesterday until I drove home the fact that they were 10, so I could understand her reasoning.  I told her multiple times they were 10 and she proceeded with what I stated earlier about their size. My response to was regardless of there appearance, they are 10 yrs old and not 11 yet, and she stated if they are close to turning 11 then your policy is that they can‚Äôt play if you feel they would be a threat to younger children. There was no confusion on what transpired. I just continued telling her they were 10 and she said that she can make an exception this one time. I realize when they turn 11 they will no longer be able to play, that was not the issue.

Review: A Perfect Spot for Kids and Parents!

We recently visited Playland Pineville with our 8 year old son and his best friend, and it exceeded all our expectations. From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how clean, bright, and thoughtfully designed the space was. The indoor playground is spacious and full of creative play zones ‚Äî from climbing structures and slides to sensory areas and imaginative play corners. Everything felt safe and well-maintained, which gave us peace of mind while the kids explored.

What truly sets this place apart for patents is the caf√©. Me and my husband enjoyed an iced matcha and a hot tea‚Ä¶ drinks were soooo good.

The staff were friendly, attentive, and clearly passionate about creating a fun, safe environment.

Whether you‚Äôre looking for a rainy-day activity or a fun outing where both kids and adults are happy, Playland is a fantastic choice. We‚Äôll definitely be back!

Review: This location is nothing short of amazing! It was an absolute delight! From the moment we walked in, the clean and neat environment made a great first impression. The layout is spacious and open, allowing for easy navigation and plenty of room for the kids to explore.

The variety of play structures kept my children entertained for hours. They had so much fun that they were genuinely upset when it was time to go home! As a bonus, the coffee served at the caf√© was delicious. It was a treat to enjoy a nice cup of HOT coffee while the kids played happily.

The owners truly make Playland special! They put in so much effort to create a welcoming atmosphere. Their dedication to maintaining the playground shines through in every detail.

Overall, Playland is an inviting and enjoyable space for both kids and parents. We‚Äôll definitely be returning!

Review: This was my first time at the indoor playground with my son. They are very nice people and they have great customer service. There were two individuals that stuck out the most that was very helpful. One of the associates even went up and got my son out of the top of the play area, cause he was scared. Her name was Teagan, she was also the one that helped me check in with me and my son arrived by scanning the barcode. She is awesome. There was another individual name Andrea she had great customer service as well. She rung us up at the register for lunchables and a juice box. Definitely will be taking my son back to the establishment. It is a awesome place and I highly recommend.

Allowing me to be by my child‚Äôs side while we slide down into the ball pit or climb and explore really makes the whole experience special and we enjoy playing together. Thank you for offering us a fun and safe place to play.

Review: Highly disappointed with this location. We love the Monroe & Mooresville location & was excited to try out this new location which is closer to the grandparents. However, today‚Äôs experience was a complete let down & we will not be back to this location.
The staff is NOT friendly like the other locations (one in particular was constantly YELLING at some younger boys)‚Ä¶ these are kids coming in, yes, keep them safe & tell them the rules by all means‚Ä¶ but yelling at them the way she did was completely uncalled for (if it was my kid she was talking to I would have said something). The manager was even rude to me when my gift card wasn‚Äôt working‚Ä¶ just not the same vibe/friendly staff as the other two locations.

Edited to add a response to the ‚Äúowners‚Äù comment below:

Your response to our experience is very disappointing and further confirmation we will no longer be loyal customers. I was not disrespectful by any means & was simply explaining to your manager it was in fact a gift card granted from one of your other locations. Now accusing me as the customer of fraud when I happily paid for our entrance when they couldn‚Äôt figure it out is exactly the reason we will not be giving this location or any of your locations our business. This all could have been handled in a professional manner and the least you as an owner could have offered to do would be to check into the gift card situation further. Instead you jumped to an extreme conclusion that this was somehow a fraudulent gift card without being present to even know the background information.

In regard to your employee, it was not only the time when everyone was asked to leave the ball pit for cleaning but several other occasions when kids were ‚Äúbreaking rules.‚Äù Correcting the children was not the problem but choosing to snap at them is not called for and an environment your guests should have to experience with Christian music playing in the background.

I hope this place reconsiders how many children are allowed at one time as it was extremely overwhelming as a mom of two young children. My son got upset a few times because he couldn‚Äôt find me as I was with our youngest. The pros- the place is very cute, and my kids had a blast and it does look clean and employees were walking around. Just not sure if I‚Äôll be back soon as we are pretty far and I don‚Äôt want to risk it being this busy again and if I can‚Äôt make a reservation during the week.

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Review: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.

The coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.

This place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Only comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.

Place is clean and they have activities for every kid. Even the very small kids.

There are plenty of tables to sit.

They have coffee and snacks like waffles, hot dogs and potato chips.

Parking is easy, they have plenty of space outside.

Perfect activity for when is too hot outside.

If it is not too busy you don‚Äôt need a reservation.

Review: We are so happy this place opened! The girls that work there are so kind and helpful. I LOVE that they check your sticker against your child's sticker on the way out and when I lost my sticker, the young woman working at the desk was asking my son ""is this your mommy?"" lol super cute and you can never be too safe! One day we were there and the side door alarm went off. I was happy no child escaped and that the alarm actually did its job. Kids can roam free without fear of losing them as you can walk around the playland; there are only a couple of small places where you may not be able to visualize them, but an adult can definitely get to those places if need be. There were the occasional kids that were on the more rambunctious side but the parents (so far) seem to do a great job of reeling them in. The bathrooms were clean and the snacks and coffee were fresh. Yeah the cafe is a little pricey but that is the price you pay to give yourself a little enjoyment while you watch your kids have a great time or get some work done on your laptop. This place would be best for walkers through about 5/6 year-olds. Lots of little toys/walkers/cars for toddlers, a sectioned off play room, and sensory board. I did see a couple kids eat-it on the slide but that is just what happens when they want to walk down the slide and not sit lol. Everything is padded and kids were still taking nose-dives/face-planting and did not seem physically harmed. It gets pretty busy and seating can be limited but otherwise we will keep coming back until he outgrows it.

Review: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It‚Äôs a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it‚Äôs been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we‚Äôd happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

The staff are so genuine, I had amazing interactions with Kyrsten, Francine, Zoie, and Andrew.. made me feel so welcome and at home with their smiling faces. The place is always sanitary and spotless as I see them picking up and cleaning constantly. Perfect place to let kids unwind after school. I will be returning!

Review: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

Review: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed üòâ Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I‚Äôm counting on Francine‚Äôs lattes to see me through!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome üòé... And I'm definitely going back!! üéâ

We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it!

Review: Recently had a birthday party here and was left a little disappointed with the price factor and what we received. Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: HAVE YOUR PARTY HERE! An amazing team, beautiful space, and a stress free day. I called them with a very vague plan for my 4 and 2 year olds joint party and they took their talents and made it come to life better than I could have imagined. All we had to do was show up the day of the party and it was ready for us and all our guests, who had an amazing time. Can‚Äôt recommend them enough!

Review: The place is cute, however when we rented the front and back out for a 2 hour party, they were starting to clean up and put food up 15 minutes before the end of the party. They were removing table cloths and taking down decor, like the expensive balloon garland we also purchased from them. In addition, they didn‚Äôt warn the kids that the bounce house was going to be deflated, also before the end of the party. There was no party after us, so
I don‚Äôt see why they‚Äôd need to be in such a rush. I paid for 2 hours of a birthday party and they very rudely cut it short. I have told everyone not to waste their money on a party at this location. The owner and whoever was working that day were extremely rude.

At the other end, they have an activity area to celebrate birthdays and any desired activity is very large. I recommend it. visit this place.

Review: If you‚Äôre looking for a beautiful venue to celebrate your special occasion, without having to sell a kidney, look no further! We recently held my daughter‚Äôs Sweet 16 Birthday party here and Andrea & Kathy totally exceeded my expectations. They were both extremely kind and easy to work with and offered great advice to elevate the decor within my budget. Their decorations were beautiful and my daughter (and her guests) were pleased with how everything turned out. These ladies have an eye for detail and they decorated the immaculate event space so beautifully. They honestly felt like family by the end of the party. I can‚Äôt recommend Confete Soiree and Play enough. Stop by and see for yourself!

Review: I had the pleasure of working with Andrea and her team to host/decorate for my daughter's first birthday party. Let me tell you, the experience was PHENOMENAL!! Preparing for a first birthday party is stressful, but the team at Confete made the planning completely stress free and seamless! Every idea and thought I had for the decor and theme they supported and brought to fruition perfectly. I also love how they deep clean the entire event space to ensure extreme cleanliness and safety for the kids; like literally hand wiping/sanitizing every object in the event space....for an OCD mom like me, it was awesome to see this. I can't thank them enough for executing my vision for my daughter's party. Everything was absolutely beautiful!!! Follow them on Instagram to see just how awesome they are!

Review: Please take the $10 I gave your company today and buy a new lock for the play area gate. The gate does not lock automatically and it is very difficult to manually lock. If you are not going to replace the lock, please ensure someone is standing at the gate making sure children do not get out of the gate as the gate is intended to ensure childrens safety. I do not recommend for children under 2 as the jungle gym may be very difficult for them to navigate alone. The play area was clean.

My littles are 2.5 years apart, and they both were entertained for over two hours. The area is closed off which is nice for little ones still figuring things out. It‚Äôs big enough but not too big! Great place for any day but especially a rainy or cold day. Will def go back!

Review: We truly had the most amazing experience here! I cannot say enough good things about this space and the people who work here. We have been multiple times just to play but their birthday party hosting skills are the best and you will not find a better place or group of people to work with. We hosted my daughters 2nd birthday here and they truly went above and beyond. They made the day perfect and I really got to just enjoy the time celebrating my little girl as they were so helpful from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It was such an enjoyable time celebrating my 2 year old with all her friends and my husband and I both agree that we will plan to hopefully have her party here every year until she outgrows the space.

It took me some time to gather the courage to share my experience, but it's important to address what went wrong. Despite a friend's words against this company I still went by, my visit to this store a couple of weeks ago was nothing short of a nightmare.

The staff's behavior was shockingly rude, and the atmosphere was incredibly unpleasant. I felt racially profiled during my visit. I strongly advise against bringing your children here, as you may risk them experiencing the same distressing treatment.

Tons of climbing areas, a ball pit, trampolines etc for kids to choose from. My daughter loves the carousel swing while my son's favorite is the trampoline area.

Review: Very clean playgym with a ton of fun equipment. However, it has issues. First of all the food/kitchen menu is basically fake. In theory, they serve both coffee and hot food, but in reality, there's never actually staff to prepare it. I've been here 10+ times. Just don't expect any food except packaged snacks.

Secondly, why is there a huge movie screen playing cartoons??? Who thought this was a good idea at a playgym? If I wanted my toddler to sit and watch Disney movies, we do that at home for free.

Too bad for these poor management decisions. High Five could be great! But right now there is zero reason to visit when you can drive 10m down Independence & go to Playland instead.

Review: Hosted a party here for my son and the kids had a blast. They do, however, need to work on logistics. We arrived 30 minutes before start time and they said we needed to wait until 15-20 minutes prior‚Äîno problem. The email stated we‚Äôd have a room attendant which we did not have. No grip socks included for my party guests. The food came and no one announced or told us it was there so by the time the kids got to it‚Äîit was cooling off. The same happened with their sweet treats at the end. No announcement, no notifying the parents‚Äîjust dropped it off to melt and walked off. The only time someone came and communicated directly with me was at the end when they wanted me to check out and pay them. For the prices they charge they should be way more accommodating to families hosting parties. If you‚Äôre going just for kids to play 6 and under it‚Äôs a good option with accessibility for the smaller kids. I‚Äôve hosted multiple kids parties and this was the least impressive experience on that front.

Review: Great spot for kids! We went recently for a 2 yr olds birthday party and everyone has a good time. There's something to do for kids of pretty much all ages... my 18 month old enjoyed herself just as much of my 9 year old. It can be a little chaotic as kids can run around independently while parents can choose to watch from the sidelines. So you just have to be extra watchful of the smaller kids to make sure the bigger ones dont run them over. The location would have been hard to find of the party host didnt specifically tell everyone it was behind the At Home store, because if you simply type the address in the GPS you would end up at the front door of the At Home store. Overall it was a great time, I would visit again!

Review: It‚Äôs a very spacious clean and fun playground with beautiful displays. However when you book a party (which is very expensive)they expect you and all your guests to be out of the entire facility in the two hour window. They also failed to put the correct amount of chairs knowing the number of guests that had signed in about an hour prior to seat for pizza and cake. The number of chairs was not updated in time. One of my guests felt left out because they took a long time to bring the chair and the little one stepped out crying. It was not a fun experience for my guest and I‚Äôm very unhappy about that.

Review: Not worth the money üëéüèª biased because I‚Äôve been to other indoor playgrounds, and this was most definitely at the bottom of my list. Parents aren‚Äôt allowed to go down the beautiful big slide they have and that really threw me for a loop since my child wanted to go down together. There was also paper signs multiple places saying that adults couldn‚Äôt go on or use areas as well as other paper signs to not lean on furniture etc. This just tells me you bought cheap furniture but charge an expensive price to get through the door. Not to mention, the cafe was not stocked with any food or snacks in the cases and when asked for a cup of coffee well over an hour before their closing time, we had been told the machine was already shut down for the day. They only offer 2 hour passes and within 30 minutes of not being able to join my toddler on things, we were ready to go but stayed since we had already paid for it. I‚Äôm sure people enjoy it here but in my opinion, spend your money elsewhere. The place was also clean, which was nice. The gate at the front had been left open a couple times and had to keep redirecting my toddler to not run away.

Review: This place was incredible for my 2 year old daughter. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a perfect indoor play area for kids under 7 years old. They had equipment for balancing, climbing obstacles, swinging and rotating equipment, tiny trampolines, ball pits, and a really cool jungle gym with three slides. Everything is soft sided so you can feel good about kids trying new things without getting hurt. Didn‚Äôt try any food or anything, but was impressed with how much my kid enjoyed it.

Review: Nice place to play for toddlers, not worth $20 though. I‚Äôd also examine the ball pits while your child is in it. There was a huge living spider in the smaller ball pit for 2 and under it looked like, luckily my 2year old seen it and notified me before anyone was bitten. Hopefully they clean out the ball pits regularly to make sure there aren‚Äôt any insects living beneath.

Review: We really enjoyed this place. My children are 1 year and 4 years old. Both kids had a great time. The playground was built in such a way that I could always visually make sure that everything was fine with my eldest and that she was having a great time, while I stayed close to my youngest daughter the whole time. Clean, beautiful, lots of fun for children. For two children it turned out to be about $35 for 2 hours, which is above average, but the day was cloudy, and most importantly the daughters had a great time.

You can book your time online, but it is not necessary. The first time I booked, the subsequent ones came simply when they wanted to play. But in the second case, it is worth considering that if the site is overcrowded, you may be refused, which has never happened to us.

There is an area for smaller toddlers to play as well. Every surface is soft so no problem if anyone falls down. They have 4 private birthday rooms. Grownups are allowed to play too. They just can't go on the trampolines or slides.I recommend.

It is HUGEEEE with tons of different obstacles and areas for kids to have fun. We took our 1 year old here and our 7 year old year. Both had an amazing time.

They are very welcoming and constantly cleaning!

My only suggestion would be quick snacks, and also, if they had music playing, that would've elevated the experience. Nonetheless, it was a great time, and I would definitely definitely be back.

Review: Came to High five for an afternoon play date. We had a blast! We went around 4PM on a Friday. Everything was clean. Even made me more excited to see people actively cleaning as we were playing. The only reason I took off one star is because the price is a bit steep for a 2 hour playtime. I only brought one of my two kids but I can‚Äôt imagine a family paying for more than 2 kids. This place is definitely geared to kids 10 and under. They have little baby sections for little ones to play on. Socks are required which is great! Hand sanitizer stations posted everywhere and lots of spaces for parents to sit out and chill. Even a place for parents who need to charge their phones, use their computers, or even moms to plug up to pump. They also have a cafe that serves food. We were going out to eat afterwards so we didn‚Äôt get to use those services. It overall we enjoyed and though the price is higher than others, we will be back!

Review: The establishment is clean, and maintained well, it was not very busy today which was nice,   Removed stars for not having any saftey measures for kids leaving with correct adults and the gate to the exit was not consistently shut either and the front door wouldn‚Äôt completely shut either   ‚Ä¶ when we got here it was so hot inside everyone was sweating even people sitting down- I personally bumped the ac to a comfortable level bc no employees were‚Ä¶ overpriced, (15 min down the road I can pay half of what I pay for 1 here )-  the food options are not healthy at all,   And there are tvs in multiple spots ‚Ä¶.  Which for some would be a  non issue but for people bringing kids who are screen free the kids just stare at the tv and video game tv  in the ball pit and barely play with the eqpt we overpaid for.  ‚Ä¶. Not allowed to go down the slide with the toddler. Means  we now have to keep redirecting away from the slide and this one loves slides. The ‚Äúlittle‚Äù slides are great for 6-9 month olds, but not 2 year olds.  the spinning car thing has broken pedals  it was not a horrible time, but it def could be better

They have put a lot of thought into protecting all of the potential hazards for a small kid who is just learning how to walk. My toddler really enjoyed it, and the staff was always cleaning. We would highly recommend this place for anyone who has more children, they have a larger area for bigger kids as well. The place is also very aesthetically beautiful. It‚Äôs a little hard to find at first since it is behind the home store.

Review: We usually go to Playland but came here with our friends a few weeks ago instead since it's closer to our home. With a 4 year old, for a few dollars more than Playland, she had a fantastic time. Absolutely loved all the play equipment. It felt pretty clean, was very spacious, had more things that parents could sit on closer to the kids if they needed help, and truly it was worth the extra dollar or two above Playland to not have to drive all the way down there.
However, the one negative thing I would say is that there's absolutely no security measures for the children or parents. There's no name tags to double check and make sure you're bringing your child out with you or someone else's kid. I felt very concerned the entire time that I had to keep a lookout near the door and make sure no creeps had come in.
Would really appreciate it if you guys have a name system and check on the tags before the parents and children leave. Playland does that.

Review: I‚Äôve visited High-five Playhouse twice now and my son and I really enjoy it. My son recently had a birthday party there last weekend and we had overall a good experience but I do wish our party host told us to leave in a kinder manner. Our party was over at 12 and we were out of the play area by 12:15. The party room was completely empty by 12 pm. We were on the side where the chairs were by 12:15 gathering last minute things but by 12:20 our party host came to me and told us we had to leave now and was very rude about it. I understand that we were still in the building 20 mins after party time but we were not in the party room or play area whatsoever.. just on the side gathering things and putting kids shoes on. I would understand more if the facility was busier or if we were in anyone‚Äôs way but like I mentioned, our party room was empty and the next party hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. At 12:20 the building alone wasn‚Äôt even as busy as it was 30 mins prior. I‚Äôm really big on customer service and I wish our birthday party experience didn't end that way. I also wish they wouldn‚Äôt tell us to start packing up 15 mins before our party time ends which cuts us short of our 2hours that we have booked. I wish they had longer slots in between parties to avoid people from feeling rushed to leave.

We had brought our son here a few times before and he loved it, so we thought it would be the perfect place for his party.  He and his friends had more fun than I even imagined they'd have.  It's the perfect play area for their age, and there are so many fun things for them to do.  Everyone talked about what an amazing place it was for a birthday party!  We had to drag our son out at the end because he was having so much fun he didn't want it to end.  Haha.  As far as setting the party up, Katina was AMAZING!!!  She was beyond helpful and so incredibly sweet.  I'd do another party there just because of how wonderful she is!  All of the girls working that day were great.

Review: Angel Island was the perfect play date for my newly turned 2 year old. He was big enough to do most things by himself and had an amazing time. We went on a Monday morning and it was not too crowded and proved to be a perfect activity to keep him entertained with plenty of activities for not only this age but for him to grow into over the next few years. Highly recommend!

I think with such a young age group, you should allow parents to go into the play gym to be able to retrieve lost children. I can't see our family returning to any of the locations.

Review: Our 3 year old loved Angel Island Fun Park. We went on a Friday afternoon. Not crowded at all. They have several reasonable payment options and a waiver you sign via scanning a bar code or doing it online. We opted for the $20 one-time visit (there's a 59 monthly option or a $72 punch card option plus more options). The $20 one-time play option was good for 3hrs of play! üòé We also purchased $3 non slip socks, so bring your own and save some cash. They also offer snacks and drinks for purchase (didn't see any hot food options), or I think you can bring your own snack and sit at the tables, check with the store. We did see children with their own water bottles in the sitting area.  I know they told us no food or beverages in the play area. They have a cubby for shoes. Free ""community"" flip flops for bathroom use (must remove your shoes for bathroom use) Im guessing you can bring your own disposable foot coverings if you're uncomfortable using the public flops, ask the store. The restroom was clean and so was the play area - soft padding for little ones. Our 3 year old navigated the play area on his own, under our watchful eyes. Parents can sit at the little tables outside the play area with a full view. The play area is also fenced with open entrances so you can stand and watch your kiddos. There's also two pay-as-you-go massage chairs in the sitting area against the wall - you can relax while getting a massage. If I recall correctly, the cost was about $5 per 10-15 minutes. I believe their website states this play place iso ages 8 and under. Parking was ok but the place is in a small plaza and if they get super busy it looks like parking could be an issue. We enjoyed our time and will be back soon. We recommend!

First off the lady Katina at check in was SO friendly and a bubbly personality. She was so fun to talk to and constantly was cleaning at different times to make sure everything was clean. Which is especially nice to see during the winter months when it‚Äôs sick season! I have never seen an indoor play space with the staff this nice and the facility this clean. I loved there was plenty to do for my girls but it wasn‚Äôt too big that I was having to run around everywhere looking for them. There‚Äôs also a vending machine that has drinks and snacks. Which was a lifesaver when they build up an appetite playing! 10/10 recommend!

I will say it‚Äôs pricey. $17 to play for two hours is expensive and I don‚Äôt think it should be that much in comparison to other places locally / within the state. I will say better attention needs to be added into the 24M and younger area. Yesterday there was a ridiculous amount of older kids in the play area meant for small kids and no parent in sight correcting them until it was to late. The service for drinks is pretty slow they need more staff

Review: I expected more. Empanadas were very dry and hard, ordered 3 orders between my sister and my friend. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Ended up throwing most away. My oldest daughter (who is 5) was helping me with my one year old in the under 2 area, and while my oldest was only sitting on the floor not saying a word, asked her to get out of the area since it‚Äôs for 2 and under only. I get the rules but it‚Äôs not like she was being rowdy or obnoxious she was literally sitting beside her sister.
Also, my friend and I came in about 10 mins apart, and my time was up (barely) and we‚Äôre already being asked (my friends time wasn‚Äôt up yet) if we were leaving or paying another hour. There isn‚Äôt a clock in sight. I won‚Äôt be back. As much as I wanted to support Latinx owned businesses. üíî

You can pay for an hour or more on the spot or online. The first time they ask you to do it online, from their website, but it is very easy.
The requirement for children is that they wear grippy socks with rubber bands.
Even I wanted to be a girl again to enjoy the games ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Review: Sock store disguised as a play area.

After signing the standard waiver before entering, stating that if my child is injured - it's on me - my 2 year old lost one of his socks (grippy socks tlarw required at all times for play - I bought my own from home).

He lost the sock in their foam pit (because the grippy part stuck to the foam), I was told he could no longer play without both socks - but they would conveniently 'sell' me a pair of socks.

Adults are not allowed in the foam pit ...so I couldn't go in to look for the sock and no member of staff offered to help find it either.

Review: Cute little place to take kids! My son is 2.5 and loves it! You will need grip socks for the kids, they have them for $4 but I suggest you buy your own since it‚Äôs more economical. Posting a pic of the socks so you buy something comparable. Certain grip socks aren‚Äôt allowed I don‚Äôt believe going by the other reviews. The place is very clean, I went around lunch time on a Friday. Not overcrowded, calm music playing, they have a ball pit and a sandbox which is a plus. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is one of the workers. The light skin mixed looking woman. She reminded me of a prison guard. She is one of the girls making sure we don‚Äôt go over our time, she was not friendly at all, no smile, not welcoming. Not sure if she was having a bad day which we all have our days so I get it but you should have a friendly personality if you‚Äôre working somewhere involving children. The rest of the staff was very nice! Let me also add if this is your first time going you will need to book online. I suggest doing that before you get there

Review: It‚Äôs a nice place, albeit a little small. I have a 2 1/2 year old and thought the place would be better suited for younger kids. There‚Äôs only one slide, and as expected, some parents are not keeping an eye on their kids, leading to kids climbing up the slide while 3 others are going down. The lack of supervision is not the fault of Unwind, but I do think they should have someone monitoring, instead of having 4 employees hanging out behind the coffee bar. There weren‚Äôt enough balls in the ball-pit/slide area.

Also, you HAVE to buy their socks. We went the Monday after their grand opening and nowhere was it listed that you had to buy their socks. On the way out, they do have a box where you can choose to donate your $4 socks so they can wash and resell. I kept mine. Check-in took forever, but it was only their second day of being open, so I hope they find a better and more efficient way of getting people in quickly.

FYI - they don‚Äôt have iced coffee.

UPDATE - so I wanted to give this place another chance. I went to their online site to book a ticket and was absolutely shocked on their new prices. $24.99 for TWO HOURS OF PLAY? I went six months ago and paid $16 for TWO HOURS. That is a $9 increase in six months. That‚Äôs a 56% increase in price. I was completely floored and astounded on how crazy expensive it got. Did they add new activities? Are they giving away stuff for free at the door? In 6 months, I don‚Äôt know what justifies that. They have outpriced themselves out of the indoor playground market.

Review: $12.99 for one hour of play is very expensive, especially if you are bringing multiple children. My baby had his own grip socks (that were brand new and clean) and the guy at the front desk made me buy THEIR grip socks. For an extra $6. Cost me close to $20 for an hour of play, and that was for one almost 2 year old. My 8 year old daughter was at school and found out that we went and has been begging to go. Unfortunately not with those astronomical prices!

Review: Our first visit and we were pleased with the facility and the staff were kind and helpful.
Our little one had a blast.
The only downside is that it was extremely packed. I feel like many of the kids were able to enjoy the areas as much as they could. For one hour time slots, I feel like they should have more of a limit on the number of kids per hour and not have the times overlapping so much.
It would give the staff more opportunity to keep areas cleaned and the children better enjoyment of the areas.

Review: This place has slipped a bit since they first opened. Unwind is advertised as a sensory play area for all kids, but especially sensitive toward kids with autism.  At the beginning we loved it for exactly that reason. But recently it seems that they do not have any control over the capacity. I went while unbeknownst to me, there was a birthday party going on and that room was packed with people....not to mention the tons of regular customers. There were children well over 7 years old (their limit) running around like crazy people, uncontrolled by their parents and the handful of employees that were there were barely able to keep the balls in the pit because of how out of control these kids were. Aside frome that, small children were getting pushed around as the older ones carelssly ran by them (nothing happened to my 4 year old, thankfully). I feel as if a family should have to rent the whole space out for whatever amount of hours they will be there and not mix other customers in.

I thought since the price was so high there would be fewer people. Nope, I could barely walk due to the amount of adults and children. No way could I enjoy a coffee or even sit down at this place. Maybe the weekdays are better?  Also their sock requirement didn‚Äôt really make any sense to me. I likely won‚Äôt return.

Review: My kids have been ill for the past 14 days after a little girl sneezed and coughed directly in my babies face. My toddler almost had to go to the hospital for dehydration from being so ill.
There were so many actively and obviously sick children in the play area. The employees are absolutely overrun by the numbers of families there. Seems like the owners would rather have a higher profit than care about screening illness out.
The rules are very clear, do not bring sick children. But it is ultimately up to the employees to deny entry to inconsiderate parents who try to bring their sick children.

Posting IG videos of your employees cleaning the equipment isn‚Äôt going to do anything when the place is overrun by actively sick children.

During Covid, people screened temps and looked for signs of sickness before admitting people into places. I would be perfectly fine with these policies in place.

Review: I think this place is okay. I think if you have a 5 year old or younger it would be great for you. My biggies ick from my this place is the length of time your kids can play. Just 1 hour and the staff literally walk around and tap you and say that your time is up would you like to pay for another hour. I have never had that happen at any other place I‚Äôve ever taken my child so if you have more than 1 child you would be paying almost $60 for 2 hours of play that‚Äôs pretty pricey. I think that if an 2 hour minimum was added it would have been better

Review: I know this place is near and my son enjoyed it but the price for the time doesn't seem to match. Then they require you to only wear their socks so please don't forget to bring them if returning. My son enjoyed the sand pit but looking around there were some people around with times that should have been up but 5 mins before my time is up staff reminded me if I stayed over 10 mins I would have to buy another hour. There is no discount for buying multiple hours at one time or anything and I couldn't imagine paying the price double. Decent amount of seating but also lots of people which means a lot of standing. The set up seems cheaply made from the fence that's wobbly to the mining wall by the sand pit, and the floor with socks on is hard on your feet.

Review: Edited: Such a salty response from the business owner. I am not a fake account, only a customer and a mom who is looking for a nice experience for my children, as well as support a woman-owned business. But the owner's reply leaves much to be desired. I am a loyal customer with Playland because they run their business well, are kind and welcoming to all customers, and make sure their equipment and play areas are clean and safe. By the way, I was not solicited or asked by Playland to mention their name or wrote a review. They are an honest business and wouldn‚Äôt engage in this weird and combative behavior.

So sorry that the owner cannot be a professional and apologize for the poor treatment I experienced‚Ä¶
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
While my kids enjoyed their play experience, I think charging $12.99 per child for one hour is very expensive, and there were no discounts for siblings.  Also, I felt their equipment was not as sturdy, especially in the baby/24 month area where the climbing thing was loose.

I ordered some items from their cafe, and they forgot to charge me for the water. While I was feeding my 2 year old, I was not aware that my hot chocolate was ready. An employee came to me and brought a credit card reader and said ‚Äúwe forgot to charge you for the water, please pay.‚Äù I was shocked because I was frazzled as I was feeding my toddler while trying to watch my other kids. They said I had to go to the counter to pay. I told them I had to feed my kid, and they offered to watch her so I can pay. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable so I had to drag my child all the way to the register - this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. It felt like they wanted to nickel and dime me when it‚Äôs THEIR fault. Not coming back again, I am sticking to Playland in Monroe.

Review: My wife and I decided on a whim to bring our 2 year old twins for a fun outing and we were not disappointed in choosing Little Doodles Play Cafe. Upon entering the cafe, the kids faces lit up with excitement and wonder. They loved the variety of toys and activities. We also used the arts and crafts room and they had a great time drawing some pictures. As for the the adults, we had a warm blueberry muffin and a iced coconut coffee. Both were delicious and very fresh. Thank you for being awesome. The note on my wife's coffee made her day.

Although my step son was a bit older - he played really well around the small kiddos. I do wish they had a bigger space and had some things for older kids but I love the concept of having a space for toddlers and smaller children. When my baby girl arrives and we need somewhere to go to get out I‚Äôll definitely be bringing her here. The food and drinks were delicious and the owner was so polite! üíì loved the art room!!

Review: This business is a great place to bring the kids to play, make a mess, dress up in their favorite characters and make friends.
You have the option to come just with your kids, plan a play date or just relax with your kids playing in a safe space.
The fact that this business supports small business is great because there are many different items you can choose from and you know is not a big corporation getting your money but a small local business.
LDPC offers bday packages and monthly membership benefits.

Review: We had out kids' 3rd birthday party here. Things were easy and everyone had a blast! We brought cakes and light snacks. We had Little Doodles decorate and provide eating-ware for a Paw Patrol themed party.

Staff was very helpful in transitioning between playtime, crafts, cake, and presents. During the party, the Cafe was open for purchase and the coffee beverages were quite good (it's not a full cafe setup, but equally yummy).

There is a large area for tables for parents to sit and a play area along the wall. The play area has a bouncy horse, shopping cart, ice cream vendor, food truck, giant blocks, tent/rock wall, pirate ship, dress up clothes and more!

Highly recommend for both play and party. All the parents commented about how great the setup was. Kids were corralled and it was air conditioned in summer (hello!).

Parking was easy as well. Everything was well-orchestrated!

They have affordable membership prices as well as day prices cheaper than other places. There are lots of activities for parents that want to guide their children in play, but independent play is safe here.

There are larger places with climbing equipment, but that is not this type of establishment. Great for a younger kids to socialize and parents who could use a cup of coffee .

Review: I have been investigating area indoor play spaces with my ""nanny kid,"" 2 y.o. male.

This is indeed a better option than a place such as Bumble Brews.

One element that I dislike is the jam-packed play area is so long and thin that it is difficult to keep an eye on him while sitting at a table up front. I propose an adjustment to the layout or more comfortable seating at the back of the space.

He is still learning so many social skills and etiquette that not being able to see him is a bit anxiety inducing.

Also, I was never able to get a strong enough wifi signal to do work/research on my laptop.

It‚Äôs perfect for children‚Äôs birthday parties, with lots of activities to do. Decorations and food are included, or you can choose to bring your own decorations and food, or a mix of both. They have lots of options for party themes to choose from, and depending on the party package you choose, the children can also do arts and crafts. This is a cozy place and only your guests will be in attendance during your allotted party time. It is a great place for children that enjoy free play, dress up, and arts and crafts. They also have a little cafe so parents can enjoy some coffee during the party. Highly recommend!

Review: I purchased the year long membership and I have loved my experience. Being a parent of a toddler that works from home this place has been a godsend. My little one can play, make friends and get out his wiggles while I work. The coffee is great and so are the snacks. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Shout out to Melissa who is always super kind to my son and always remembers our names when we come in. So grateful for this place. If you are a stay at home or work from home parent of little ones you will get your moneys worth here!

Review: Little Doodles is a fantastic place to get some work done while kiddos play independently. It truly feels like a community. Our favorite spot is the art room - it's clear they put a ton of thought into how to make the space special for littles. They also sell local goods/crafts, coffee, kid-friendly snacks. Just a heads up that no outside food drink (besides water) are allowed - purchasing things helps keep the place in business!

Review: 1. Most of the toys that were battery operated must not have had batteries or the batteries were dead.
Edit: Why have battery operated toys if you can‚Äôt have batteries?
2. The worker was on her phone instead of cleaning the toys in the bin that needs to be sanitized.
3. Lots of toys missing parts or broken. The busy board that was on the wall a piece was about to fall off and it was missing a piece already.
Edit: I mean, it took me all of 5 seconds to see the busy board needed repair.
4. Place definitely needs to be reorganized and cleaned.
Edit: While it could have been busy before we got there at 12:30pm, it certainly was not when we were there. I was there for my child and still managed to find a put toys back where they should have been and I don‚Äôt even work there.

The concept is good, but for the price I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd return. Felt chaotic with how messy it was (And there were only 2 other kids in another room). The worker should‚Äôve been cleaning things and organizing. Maybe they will next time.

There's just way too much to do for one person, which means coffee/food service takes forever and the line is often long. The people working here are wonderful, but just completely overwhelmed. It kinda ruins the whole ""coffee shop w/ a playground"" idea they're trying to pitch.

Review: We had a great experience at Little Doodles! I took two of my kids (ages 2 and 5) last week and they didn't want to leave. It was our first time at a play cafe like this, but the experience had us all wanting to go back more often!
The pros of this spot for me:
- The seating area - I had a clear view from my table of basically all of the play spaces so when my 2 year old was wandering around, I could be at my table but still have eyes on her.
- The selection of toys and activities. Between the play sets, the art center, and the discovery room - both of my kids were occupied for the 3+ hours we spent there, and we honestly could've spent many more.
- The ability to come and go, and stay as long as we wanted. The biggest perk of Little Doodles to me is that our day pass covered the whole day! We got there 20 minutes after they opened, left to run to a store about 2 hours in, and then came back for another hour before we had to head to school pick up. That flexibility is huge for me as we drove an hour from the Lillington area to visit this location.

We ate lunch here and the food was okay. It is standard cafeteria-esque food you'd expect from a small cafe and fit our needs, but I wouldn't come here just for the food or coffee. It is the safe, fun atmosphere for the kids while the parent/caretaker can work or just hang out that you really come for - and they do that exceptionally well! We will return! I wish we lived closer because I would have bought the year membership on the spot and we'd be there several days a week! Living an hour away, I haven't decided how often we'll be able to make it up that way to commit to a membership just yet.

Review: I really want to love this place, but it just misses the mark each time we go. I just want a good coffee while I watch my kid play. Unless you drink black coffee, I would not recommend any coffee drink there. The staff is sweet, she‚Äôs just not a barista, and that‚Äôs fine. The toy sets that are there are cute and my kid likes them, but they don‚Äôt really have accessories for it (for example, the ice cream cart doesn‚Äôt have any ice cream in it. Sure, my kid can use her imagination, but at $10 per kid and an overpriced below average coffee, it‚Äôs just not worth it to us. Still, I give 4 stars because I do like the concept and the staff. It is just a bit overpriced for what it is.

Review: I cannot say enough good things about We Kan Go Play! I've gone a few times with my kids, and each visit has been amazing. They have an absolute blast and could play for hours on end!

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and we absolutely love the owners. They're incredibly attentive to both my needs and my kids' while we‚Äôre there. It‚Äôs clear they genuinely care about the community.

What stands out most is their commitment to cleanliness and safety‚ÄîShay (the owner) is constantly cleaning toys and surfaces while the kids play. It gives me such peace of mind.

I truly can't believe how LUCKY I am to have this gem just five minutes from my house. It‚Äôs such a blessing‚Äîfor me and for all the moms in Mount Holly!

Review: Couldn't recommend them enough! I've taken my two girls (4 and 9) for a regular play date and we loved it enough to immediately book a birthday party for the 4 year old.
What you get with a place like this, as opposed to a chain, is that the owners clearly take pride in their work and are very hands on with everything. Everything is extremely clean and well taken care of, the toys are high quality, engaging and actually fun! The area is thoughtfully laid out to where you will constantly find new things as you walk around, but doesn't feel overwhelming with clutter.
With the party, I came in to decorate with a random box of decorations and Shay (one of the owners) came out to immediately help bring in stuff from my car and helped put up the decorations with me. Honestly, couldn't have done it without her. They make the whole process as easy as possible, they are there to help when needed and you don't have to worry any clean up!
Overall, for parties or just a playdate for the kids, this place is a high quality establishment with extraordinary owners!

Review: Such a wonderful place! The owners have created such a special and NEEDED spot for kids in the area.

You‚Äôre greeted as soon as you walk in with smiles, warmth, and *the most* aesthetically pleasing kids‚Äô space I‚Äôve been to around here. The colors, designated areas - everything was planned so intentionally.

There‚Äôs so much to do, and yet it‚Äôs done in a way that invites kids vs overwhelms them. Sensory areas, imaginative play, trains, a scarf wind tunnel, stem activities, indoor playground set, a gated baby play area, climbing and jumping‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all there, plus things like board games, color wonder and puzzles in the caf√© seating area - which can also entertain older siblings.

You can make a cup of (complimentary) coffee, grab a seat, and see your child from any vantage point. Snacks are allowed to be brought in and also available for purchase - plus a water station.

While you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôll find ‚ÄúMs. Shay‚Äù sanitizing often - checking in, engaging with the kids, and making it feel more like a community than just an indoor park.

We love visiting here!

It‚Äôs clean and the ownership takes the time to speak to you and ask your thoughts. Innovative toys, sensory sections, and they also can do birthday parties. Section for parents to monitor is comfortable, and gate entrance once you walk in to ensure your child does not make their way out the door without you. Huge fan and will be adding this place to our list for rainy or really hot days.  Suggest you pre book your play time slot as they do monitor their capacity.

Review: We recently held a birthday party for our baby at Over the Moon and everything was great. The staff were extremely helpful and communicative. We visit OTM frequently for regular play dates as well and have always had good experiences. They restrict entry to a certain number of people, so it never gets too crowded. Perfect for those days when it's too hot/cold/rainy etc. to play outside.

Review: Great play space for children up to 5-6 years old. Lots of open space, safe soft rubber covered floors, different types of play items. Always super clean in both the playroom and common areas. Toilet is always clean there are always diapers and wet wipes if you happen to forget. Enjoy coffee or tea served free of charge, you can buy on site self-service different snacks. There is also an enclosed space for children under a year old. Most importantly the place is very cozy and nice staff.

Review: I was disappointed after making a reservation for baby and paying $14.00, there was an area with low seating, blocks, several foam pieces center of room and a table/chairs.  My 9 month old granddaughter is not interested in sitting at a table nor does she want to sit on a low couch.  she wants to crawl and have toys available (not the case here).  You did have one magnetic wall with twirl toys on she was interested in, but that was it.  There was another toy where you could put balls into it but there were no balls.  After being there possibly 10 minutes if that, we left.  Not going back.

Review: It really saddens me to write this review, as once upon a time I would have easily written a 5 star review. I have been bringing my 4.5 year old daughter to Over The Moon since she was 1. Before she started preschool we used to come several times a week, we loved it that much! Unfortunately I think we have visited for the last time. The concept, decor, and toys at OTM are so cool and so much fun! Unfortunately, the decline in overall experience since we first started coming here has been SHARP in just about every way. When we first started coming there was a wonderful and caring group of staff members, and the same can not be said about the current group. The last several times we have come the staff have spent more time talking to each other than doing any kind of supervision of the play area. The last time we were there there was only one staff member working, and she NEVER looked back into the play area once. We used to see staff members occasionally go through and pick up toys, reset the obstacle course, etc. and we certainly have not seen that lately. While I‚Äôm always happy to see a local business succeed, the crowd level has been out of control lately, and it can be very overwhelming. Unfortunately, the bigger issue is that many parents don‚Äôt supervise their children adequately. Today a small child (who was in the calm toddler area, no less) whose parent was across the room threw a large toy rocket right at my daughter. Fortunately, it hit her in the back, not the head, but when the child‚Äôs parent was finally located they shrugged it off and continued to let the child run around unsupervised. The staff also didn‚Äôt seem to care about this incident or the lack of supervision which narrowly missed causing a serious injury. Unfortunately, that was the last straw for me. I truly hope the OTM experience can go back to the way it used to be, but until that happens, we sadly won‚Äôt be back.

The free tea and coffee meant that the visit practically paid for itself as I was able to sit and get 1.5 of work done while my kiddo ran off her energy on a rain day. The climbing equipment was age appropriate and challenging enough that she was super proud of the skills she learned while she was there. She cried that she didn't want to leave and I had to reassure her we are coming back!

Review: I wish I could give 10/10 stars!  This place is so thoughtfully designed for parents of young children- infant through elementary school aged.

The space is relatively large, very safe, and even has an infant area. The hours are broader than a lot of competitors and better priced. You can also buy memberships or multiple passes at a time at a discount.

The dining area is spacious while still allowing a great view of the play area. This space provides free specialty coffees (from a machine) and free WiFi!  They also have a fridge of snacks for purchase.

They offer free socks to borrow instead of only for purchase like most other places. You can use the space for free play or birthday parties. They have separate rooms for the food/cake during the party. We attended a birthday there and they did a great job hosting.

They also do an excellent job cleaning the facility throughout the day.  The staff is friendly and professional. I‚Äôm probably missing other great features I‚Äôll think of later.

I‚Äôve been to all the indoor play areas around here and this blows all others out of the water!  I hope they consider opening more locations around the Triangle.

Review: Searched Google for 'indoor play'' and Over The Moon came up as one of the options. We checked in via a bar code or tablet. And paid the same way - $14 got us an hour and a half of play. Our 3 year old had a blast moving from obstacle to obstacle, climbing, and making friends. I would recommend adding a moon bounce or soft thick obstacles for small children to climb - our son needed help a couple of times, and a vending massage chair or something for parents. There was plenty of open space and room to play. Clean place and they offer a sink at the entrance for hand washing, cubbies for shoes, and coat hangers. No shoes or bare feet allowed in the play area, but they do offer socks for the little ones to borrow, if you forget theirs.  Very nice hosts who are friendly to the children and explain the rules. This location also offered free coffee, tables for snacks or sitting while you watch your little ones play (ok to bring your own snacks or kid water bottles), party rooms, etc. Not a lot of seats in the play area for parents but the floors against the walls are cushioned so you can sit and watch or do your own stretching ;). They also have a section for babies/toddlers and a fish tank in the corner.

There's climbing structures, obstacle courses, building materials, toys, books, and an area just for smaller children, all with a space theme. The rocket with a view of outer space from the top level is a standout feature. Coffee and tea are free in the cafe area, and you can buy kid-friendly drinks and snacks. I recommend reserving ahead since they manage the numbers to keep it from getting too crowded.

Review: Today we visited Minds of Every Kind for the first time and my boys (2 & 6) thoroughly enjoyed it! My 6 year old has mild autism, specifically working on social/emotional skills a lot lately & self-regulation, and it was a fresh of breath air to go to a place where he was fully accepted whether he was calm or having an occasional moment. The boys' favorite activities were the rock climbing wall, ball pit and trampolines but there are lots of different sensory experiences and play options in the open spaces as well as little side rooms off of the main area. The owner and support staff were very friendly and helpful. They even offered snacks/drinks for my children from a kitchen on location. My children are already talking about coming back and we definitely will be!

Review: Minds of Every Kind is an amazing sensory friendly gym! It is rare to find a place that caters to our children that have different needs. Summer greeted us when we arrived and was very kind, informative and welcoming! The facility itself was clean, had a variety of activities (sensory swings, rock walls, cool down/quiet room, slides, etc‚Ä¶) they offered snacks/drinks for the kids and even coffee for the parents! From the time we walked in our kids were smiling and laughing for hours. It was a beautiful sight and it was a relief to be in a safe space. One where I don‚Äôt have to apologize if my children are too loud or have to explain what is already understood. I highly recommend bringing your family to experience this wonderful gym. Courtney and the staff are amazing and just get it! You will not be disappointed!

Review: Outrageously upset about the fact that Little bees indoor playground was extremely perfect for my four year old toddler. I was looking for somewhere to take him to release all his pent up energy.! (Too cold and wet for the playgrounds). Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny.. Ideal place to stop by if you have children that love imaginative and interactive playtime!

Ps. I will be back day after day

Review: My friend and I visited each with 3 kids 4 and younger. It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue ""Elsa"" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!

We just had our child's birthday today and it was great. The owner and staff were friendly, communicative, and kind. They really went above and beyond for our kid's party and helped ensure the it went off without a hitch! We had a great experience.

The place is so clean! It is big enough that all the kids can run around without it feeling crowded, but small enough that parents don't have to keep moving to keep their kids in line-of-sight.

Review: I used to work here back during the 1st two years of it being open. It‚Äôs so cool to see all the new stuff they‚Äôve added but it‚Äôs a shame that the customer service has plummeted to a zero. I remember customer service used to be a top priority here. The teenagers working look like they‚Äôre being forced to work here and like it‚Äôs such a burden. One girl was asleep at the jumping zone where the air bag is. Smh there was multiple kids jumping at the same time, adults jumping with more than one child in their arms. There was no kind of safety being implemented. The other employees in the area would just point to her and laugh, they didn‚Äôt even bother to wake her up. 30 minutes of this went by before a manager was called over. Which leads me to my next point. The managers had no sense of customer service either. Would walk right  by you and make eye contact and not even smile or say hi. At one point a manger walked into the jump zone where the girl was sleeping and didn‚Äôt even say anything to her. When I worked here years ago, food that was ordered was brought to the customers wherever they were in the facility. I ordered food and after 20 minutes still had not received it, I went to the cafe and there my food was sitting under the warmer. I wish they would‚Äôve told me I had to come get my food. I mean what‚Äôs the point of giving me a stand with a number if I‚Äôve got to come get it myself? Maybe give me a time frame too! All in all my kids had a great time but as the adult who‚Äôs spending $40+ in just 2 hours, I lol at these things and they matter to me.

Review: Very negative experience.  Paid for a ""package"" with an ""add on extra attraction 1 time use"". The rides included in the package which had a countdown of 2 hours to use did not have operators at the attractions which meant even though they were advertised as part of the package, could not be used during periods of my 2 hour package. Several instances not due to my actions resulted in delayed operation times on rides which in turn ate into my kids 2 hour usage time. After all of the negative experiences went to use my add on attraction only to be told my time had ran out. Attendant called the supervisor over after I complained and he told them to let us use it anyway since we had paid for it, only to have an entire birthday  party pass us waiting for the manager to arrive which in turn would've meant waiting for 25 kids to get on the ropes course before my kid would have even though he was ahead of them in line. Would've took hour to hour and half just to ride one attraction.  Told manager we wanted a refund and he was an all out confrontational dick who refused to give me a 9.00 refund which in turn probably costed the establishment more than 9.00 in the long run. Hope someone in management learns a lesson from this.

Review: Place was fun. Only 3 stars because of the 3 rude employees I encountered. Especially the young girl with the bad wig working the laser tag that acted like she‚Äôd rather be anywhere else and wouldn‚Äôt talk to the customers which caused confusion as to what was going on. Strange experience.

Review: Great place to let the kids run free. They have specials all the time and coupons if you look for them. Mini golf was cool and the kids loved the jump park. Go karts were definitely not worth the wait in line if you like to go fast. Lots to do to pass several hours of a day for younger kids. The games are reasonably priced but quick on game over. Bring about $100 for two kids just to get in the door though. Price is why 4 stars. It's a great bandaid between vacations but need to budget accordingly. The prizes for tickets are some of the best deals I've seen though.

The prices are pretty reasonable, especially if you pay by activity. There‚Äôs bumper cars, a ropes course, go karts, laser tag, trampolines and many other attractions. Of course, there are a bunch of arcades! Overall, it‚Äôs a good time for kids. They also have food in the venue so that‚Äôs convenient. The crowd is also not very crazy on most Sundays, so it‚Äôs nice not to have to stand in line. Lots of convenient parking and lots of restaurants in the vicinity. It‚Äôs conveniently located, right off 540.

I get it‚Äôs a high traffic area but you can see the dirt on the flooring, the soft touch toys are falling apart, and there‚Äôs trash everywhere. My husband even commented on how filthy it was. The mini golf was fun until a group of older kids come up and try to take my 2 year olds golf ball so they could play for free. Their parents did absolutely nothing, just sat and a corner, talked, and ignored the situation. Their kids were running all over the place and almost hit my son with a golf club. There are WAY better places for family fun.

They also have Lazer tag, putt-putt, bumper cars, and a high-zipline/climb zone (but she's too teeny for those things right now)

It's not ridiculously expensive, and they offer bundle deals on the entire park. It's definitely worth checking out on a rainy day if you're going stir crazy in the house, but be forewarned....they will want to go back again and again and again and again and again lol

Go carts are super slow and the guy operating them was super rude to my 10 year old son. Was an inch too short to drive though he races at rushhour. And had the nerve to tell him that ""maybe if you ate your Wheaties, you'd be taller."" He was lucky the concrete around him didn't turn red.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: We absolutely love We Rock the Spectrum! One of the best places to host a birthday for ages 1-10. The owners and staff are amazing! We chose a platinum party and they took care of all decorations in the party room and well as favors and plates/napkins/cutlery and drinks for the kids. The play space is perfect for kiddos (we had 33 kids plus adults in attendance with plenty of room) and they also offer vendors such as face painting. We were allowed to bring in our own food and an animal entertainer as well as decorate a separate area for photos. If you are looking for a birthday party venue, this is the place! They also have open play and parents night outs as well as seasonal events so plenty of opportunities to play and check out the space!

They not only helped with the set up, decorations and clean up, they also helped serving food, drinks and dessert. Sometimes when you have a party at a play space you feel a little panicked to get everything set up in a half hour, but this was a breeze. And of course, the 22 kids loved it! There is something for everyone and even with a large party the kids seemed to spread out to all of the different play areas. The zip line and trampoline were the favorites! Highly recommend We Rock The Spectrum for a birthday party! We will certainly be back for open play.

You take off your shoes and play in socks. They have so many fun and sensory seeking activities from a zip line, to rock climbing to trampolines to swings. There is a soothing calm room that is dimly lit. There is also an arts and crafts corner and little play stations for grocery shopping, a vet, trucks, dollhouses and many toys for imaginative play.

Review: We really enjoyed our experience at We Rock the Spectrum. We have been once for open play. We also utilized the Parents Night Out. My son runs in spurts, there wasn't much room for that.
I do feel that they've made a good use of their space. He kept wanting to run on the mats where the zipline was, so I was getting looks. I still said sorry probably too much. My son seemed to really enjoy the parents night out. I was glad for that option. I would definitely utilize it again. We haven't been back for open play since adding a little one to our family. She's just now crawling. I don't see paying an extra $12 for an infant from birth to 1. I definitely can't bring her stroller in. There's not much space. I don't see paying $12 to carry around my baby to follow-up big brother around. He's not where I can feel comfortably and let him roam. I can't let her crawl around on the floor in there. Other than the slightly limited space and the high infant price (from 1 day old to 364) we really liked it. Customer service was average. They weren't rude, but weren't super friendly either.

We did 20 people birthday party for kids and it was a blast !
It seems like a good balance between 2 hours of fun and eating time, we could choose when and how to do it. The room is completely equipped with big tv ( didn‚Äôt use it) chairs and tables, kitchen tools, coffee machine and fridge!
We eat it for 4 days and it was still good. Price wasn‚Äôt cheap but not the most expensive one either. We had the place for 2 hours only reserved to us !
One thing to consider for the next time is music ( they have a local speaker connected to Spotify only) and giving a one spot coverage, you can think of bringing your own for the eating area too.
Thank you We Rock team !

Review: We LOVE We Rock the Spectrum - Cary! My four year old autistic son and six year old son with ADHD did their day camp for the last two weeks and have also been going to their weekend parties. They really liked it! This place has been truly a breath of fresh air - a place that is designed to accommodate my kids, releasing me from the usual worries that go with private drop-off programs like whether they will be patient and flexible with my kids and whether I'll get a call asking me to pick them up early because of ""bad behavior"" (which has usually been code for the camp having failed to provide adequate support). The place has amazing gym equipment to give my kids the proprioceptive and vestibular input (aka joy!!) they need. There's also an arts/crafts activity as part of each camp day. Critically, while the kids are given a schedule of activities (gym time, arts/crafts, lunch) and encouraged to follow it, there is plenty of flexibility if, for example, my kid really wants to just do gym equipment for the day. They can allow this because of the extremely high counselor-to-camper ratio.

An example of how this place made my life and my kids' life easier: one morning my boys decided at the last minute that they wanted to wear their superhero costumes to camp. I was able to give them a quick and easy ""sure, why not?"" And that was that. I wasn't worried that some adult or kid at the camp would hassle them or me over it.

They also have parties periodically. My kids have done those as well, and really liked them!

They also have various other things like birthday parties and parents night out (aka you can drop your kids there while you go on a date).

I personally dropped the kids there every day and observed the vibe. It's a happy place. Music softly playing while kids swing, spin, jump and play.

Did my kids need to be redirected sometimes (e.g. reminded of certain necessary rules like waiting for their turn for the zip line, or staying off the zipline runway for safety)? Yes! Did I feel this was always handled with kindness and understanding? Also yes! And that's the key. Jes, who runs it, is herself a parent of a neurodivergent kid, and I felt she really got it.

The camp is 9am to 1pm. The way that works is that 9am is the earliest you're allowed to arrive, and it's no problem if you show up late. It's not like there's some rigid group circle time activity at 9am that you'll get hassled for interrupting. When life happened, we sometimes showed up at 9:30 or 10 and it was fine. You need to come get your kids by 1pm, i.e. that's when they stop providing camp counselor staffing, but if your kid wants to continue there past 1pm you can pay for Open Play for the afternoon while you hang out there.

For those who, like us, live far enough away that it's not realistic to do two round trips for drop off and pickup, there are a couple options that worked well. One option, which we ended up doing almost every day, is that we had a sitter pick the kids up at 1pm and take them to a playground or play space for the afternoon (e.g., Downtown Cary Park, Pleasant Park in Apex, Over the Moon, Marbles Museum). I understand that's not an option for everyone. Another option is that sometimes I'd stay in the Cary/Morrisville area for the morning, filling the time on my laptop at a cafe or walking one of the nearby trails. There's also a lot of shopping nearby (e.g. Trader Joe's, Target, Michaels, Home Goods).

I'm posting this because I think this place is really valuable and serves a huge need in the Triangle area for neurodivergent kids, so I want others to be aware of this resource. I also want it to succeed so that it will continue to be there for my own kids! The business just opened and I can tell they are still evaluating whether they can make it work. The more people who go, the better their chances will be! I'm hopeful that they will eventually also open a location over here where we live in Chapel Hill.

We have done 2 of the parents nights out. They feed and watch them for 3 hours.  It is cheaper than a sitter and she has way more fun, comes home exhausted.
Check it out.

Review: My son was recently diagnosed with autism. Though he thoroughly enjoys trying out new playgrounds and play places, we've had several occasions where he gets over excited or over simulated and gets loud or a little too wild, thus causing other kids to get upset or other parents to stare and pass judgment. Judgment. I love how at this play place, children are free to play in a non-judgmental space. I also appreciate the fact that a lot of the play activities are based around different movements and fun that support an array of sensory needs. Both of my children, ages 15 months and 4 1/2, loved coming here! Will be back!

Review: We had our son‚Äôs birthday party at We Rock the Spectrum and it was AMAZING! It was definitely the BEST venue we have ever chosen! We were able to rent the entire space, so it was just our family and friends, which was so nice. It kept the noise (and germ) levels down and everyone had an AMAZING experience! The kids had an absolute BLAST and the parents did too! When I arrived, Jessica (one of the founders) and her team of employees immediately jumped in to help me decorate the party room!!! They untangled balloons (it was windy), put together my cupcake stand, hung our backdrop & other decorations, put tablecloths on the tables, and helped me figure out which tables would work best for gifts, desserts, food, and seating. They put little monster trucks on cupcakes and the cupcakes on the stand. They even took photos of the party room for me once it was decorated. They help supervise the kids and keep them safe (especially on the zip line, rock wall, and giant trampoline), which allows parents to relax a bit instead of having to be on high alert nonstop.

The entire facility was SPOTLESS (it always is). When I walked in, there was employees all over the place spraying and wiping down counters, equipment, toys, etc. I am an RN. So, I tend to be hyper aware of germs and the importance of proper cleaning between parties is huge for me.

Jessica was absolutely WONDERFUL! She asked what kind of music we preferred and what volume level. She (and the rest of her staff) were super friendly and show genuine concern for kids with sensory issues and they also understand that all kids can get overwhelmed due to sensory overload! That is why they have a calming room with sensory friendly lighting, noise canceling head phones, quiet activities, and comfy pillows to sit and relax on. It is so nice for kids (and parents) who need to take breaks from the noise! I cannot say enough good things about We Rock the Spectrum! I take my son and my niece frequently to play and have introduced lots of our friends too. I highly recommend them anytimew, and for birthday parties (both the experience and the value for such an affordable price) they reign supreme!

Review: We LOVE IT HERE! While the space is small compared to other places, there's lots to get into. My toddler is shy and likes to play alone and there are many corners for her to do just that until she has had time to open up.
They even have a calming room, craft area, and a teen room for those who are required to be there but want to get away.  The staff makes it easy to checkin and monitor the floor and tidy up around the kids. The families that come in are polite and friendly, not too invase. A perfect place for a rainy weekend or a day that too hot or cold to play outdoors.

Review: Was VERY disappointed to find out that their track out camp is only for kids up to 10yrs old. It‚Äôs not mentioned on their website. I called before visiting and wasn‚Äôt told. When I visited with my son it wasn‚Äôt mentioned. When I called after visiting and talked to one of the owners I still wasn‚Äôt told. Taking kids with Autism out in public is VERY stressful for parents. And we live 30 minutes away. I would not have spent the time, money, and anxiety to go had I known.

Review: Im writing this on behalf of my friend. We came in today hoping to have a play date but unfortunately my friend had left because of the rude behavior Valeria responded with. All my friend asked was if she could turn the music down and she said she would a little but then turn it back up when the other kids  arrive. I know it sounds so small but my friend is around a lot of loud noises all the time and she was just asking for a small favor it was rudely considered. It was obvious Valeria just didn‚Äôt want to deal with her and brushed her off and was short. It‚Äôs unexpected to see this behavior at pricey establishment I would expect more respect.

Review: I didn‚Äôt grow up with birthday parties so that was something I wanted to change when I had kids. After visiting Town of Fun the first couple weeks they were open, I was so impressed that I immediately went home and booked online.

To say it was the easiest and best experience is truly an understatement. I filled out the form and booked my date online (I hate when I can‚Äôt book online) and received an email confirming/ asking if I had any questions before I even had my coffee the next morning.
All emails that I received there after were just so organized and streamlined.

The day of the party I was so nervous, especially with a possible snow storm, but when I showed up that afternoon, everything was set up for me which truly allowed me to enjoy the time with my child and all her friends without having to worry about anything. The organization of time, clean up, and everything was truly the best. And even better, my child (who just learned to FaceTime) has been begging me to FaceTime all our family members so she can tell them how awesome her party was.

If I could give ten stars I would!

The cap on the play time is incredible, and having the space to bring your own food, change your kiddos, make art projects, and play, the owner has thought of everything. She is the most kind person, and you can tell she really cares about her customers! We got blocked in by a huge truck unloading to another business and she let us stay inside and wait for the truck to move so we didn't have to sit in the rain. And the other time my son fell down and she gave him stickers and checked on him to make sure he was okay! We will be back PLENTY! LOVE it!!

Review: We had the greatest experience with our 1 year old birthday party at Town of Fun! Valeria was super responsive when I booked and anytime I had questions in between the time I booked and the week of the party. The space was so easy to decorate and the team at Town of Fun pitched in wonderfully for our set-up and breakdown. The party is 2 hours and we had such a great time, I wished we had just a bit more time to eat food/socialize. But I felt like the food/cake time was a little short because 1. One year olds are new eaters and needed a lot of supervision during meals and 2. My family/friends love to talk/socialize while eating. For future parties for my family, I know now to shorten the playtime to allow for more time to eat/socialize with guestsüôÇ.

The facility is new, clean and is in a prime location (Morrisville/RTP. There‚Äôs plenty of parking too! Thank you for hosting our baby‚Äôs first birthday party, we will be back again soon to play!

The only wish I have is the little toddlers space had a separate taller gate that adults had to open or something to make sure the bigger kids stayed out (which I‚Äôm well aware is very difficult!!). Some of the older kids were still coming in and for some of the little kids it got a little scary. But I loved everything about it we‚Äôll hopefully do a membership and classes.

Review: I compared 5 or 6 indoor play centers in the North Carolina area and finally chose TOWN OF FUN. I‚Äôm really happy I selected this place for my 4-year-old son‚Äôs birthday party.

The environment here is great and very clean. Since it‚Äôs a newly opened play center, all the toys are brand new. The indoor space is large, and even with nearly 40 guests, the room didn‚Äôt feel crowded at all. Both adults and children had separate areas to relax and play.
The staff was incredibly responsible and attentive. I‚Äôm especially grateful to Valeria, who coordinated with me via email during the planning phase. I shared my preferences regarding the party‚Äôs timing and decorations, and she arranged everything perfectly. She even reminded me of details I hadn‚Äôt thought of, like background music and setup times, and helped me plan accordingly. On the morning of the party, 4 or 5 staff members helped us set up the room quickly. They worked fast and had all the necessary equipment, so we finished decorating in less than an hour, leaving me plenty of time to prepare for other things.
During the entire birthday party, the staff cooperated with all our plans. They helped organize games for the kids, served food, greeted guests, and sorted the presents. We invited 17 families, so there was a lot to handle, but with their assistance, everything went smoothly. I am so thankful for that.
I also noticed how seriously Town of Fun takes hygiene. After the guests left, I saw the staff immediately begin cleaning the room and toys, even skipping lunch. They thoroughly cleaned the ball pit with a vacuum and paid great attention to detail. I believe this is especially beneficial for young children, as their immune systems aren‚Äôt fully developed, making them more susceptible to germs in indoor play areas. Their focus on cleanliness helps protect the kids.
It‚Äôs very fun! Children aged 1 to 10 can all have a great time here ‚Äì it‚Äôs definitely a paradise for kids.
I‚Äôm so glad my son had an unforgettable birthday party here.

Review: We hosted our birthday party at town of fun and it was a blast. Kids had very good time. This place has lot of pretend and play scenes and will engage kids (2 to 6) the most. They also have secured section for below 2 years to crawl and play. The party space was huge and we could bring our own food. Team was very helpful in setting up our party decor and accommodated our customizations. A microwave oven would have helped but we understood they don‚Äôt have full kitchen.

The large open space makes this venue a must choose for any occasion. You could book the space for as much as time as needed for additional charge. Kids will enjoy the most.

Review: We loved this new play space! Everything is very well planned and i so appreciate the parent seating space and organized diaper changing station in the  bathroom. I would love if sanitizing hands was required before playing (lots of play places require this) and if more sanitizer stations were readily available near the kids play space! That‚Äôs my only worry with a place like this is the spreading of germs!

In addition, the price made me sad! I was so hoping this would be a place that we could frequent but $20 for my one child for 2 hours will make it a treat for us but sadly not a thing we can routinely do!! I loved everything this place has to offer!

Review: A really cute and clean place. All of the play areas are really well put together and there is a ton of space for kids to run around. It was very entertaining for my busy two year old.

The only downside is how expensive it is. It is almost 20.00 for two hours of play. I wasn‚Äôt aware they didn‚Äôt do drop ins and that the two hour play sessions started at a certain time so I paid for 2 hours of play but only received 1 hour for my son.

Also adding that‚Äôs its $15 and some change for an hour I was expecting a lot more. I think adding more toddler friendly activities/toys could easily fix my review.

Review: We recently celebrated our son Zayn‚Äôs 3rd birthday at Piney Town Play Space, and it was truly a five-star experience from start to finish!

The theme was George from Peppa Pig, and Courtney along with the amazing staff absolutely delivered. Every detail was thoughtful, colorful, and perfect for the occasion. The kids had a blast, and the entire event was so well-organized that we could actually relax and enjoy it.

We initially had some concerns because we invited a big group of friends, and we were worried the space might be too small or that we‚Äôd somehow be over capacity ‚Äî but the space was HUGE! It was more than enough for everyone to play, mingle, and celebrate comfortably. Courtney, the owner, even called me personally before the party to check in, reassure me, and make sure we were confident in moving forward ‚Äî that level of personal care really meant a lot.

We chose the Pandarosa package, which included 48 cupcakes, sweet tea, lemonade, chicken trays for the adults (so delicious!), and 7 large pizzas for the kids. There was plenty of food and even some left over ‚Äî they really thought of everything.

Special shoutout to Ede, Railey, and Madison who were absolutely wonderful ‚Äî so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the entire party. Their energy made the day even more special.

Overall, Piney Town made Zayn‚Äôs 3rd birthday unforgettable. Everything was smooth, stress-free, and full of joy. We can‚Äôt thank Courtney and her team enough, and we highly recommend Piney Town Play Space to anyone looking for the perfect place¬†to¬†celebrate!

A couple of things to note: reservations are recommended, and they strictly limit outside food to infant formula, milk, or water bottles.

Memberships are reasonably priced, and the extended hours are perfect for after-work energy burn-off.

Review: Beautiful place! Our daughter loved the play area. I do wish I had been warned about most of little girls wearing princess dresses. Being our first time I didn't think that was a thing. My daughter felt left out. We saw Belle and she was very snarky towards kids and played favorites with some of the girls. She was very overwhelmed! Would go again.

Review: I love Piney Town but more importantly, my granddaughter does.   She always enjoys the open play but had her first character experience on Sunday and was ecstatic.  I could not have asked for a more positive experience.   The tickets are limited to the amount sold so it's a small intimate group.  ""Moana"" took time to make sure every child felt special.   They had a group activity, pictures and just a super time.  Thank you Pineytown you are knocking it out of the park.

Review: The place seems very clean and the different themed centers are absolutely adorable.  The reason that I‚Äôm only giving 4 stars is that there seemed to be a lack of actual toys in each of the centers.  There were probably 20 children there during our visit.  There were only 2 ride on toys, the toys in the themed centers seemed very sparse, and the train table (which was very popular with the little boys) only had 3 magnetic trains.  I‚Äôm sure that the reason is to make clean-up more manageable, but helping children learn to share is near impossible with not enough toys to go around.

Review: Fabulous experience! We attended the sensory friendly event and it was exactly what we have been looking for locally! My children love playing at Piney Town, and at busier times it can get overwhelming for my kids (but great to see a local, family owned business thriving and full of joy!). I highly recommend checking out the sensory friendly playtime for anyone with children who need a calmer environment to explore and play. I am happy to support a business where the owners listen to feedback, ask questions, and work to make their environment enjoyable for all children.

My family has also attended the daddy/daughter event and a princess event, as well as regular open play sessions and have had a blast!

Review: Piney Town is awesome!  It is a clean, safe place for indoor play.  It is particularly nice for littles to get energy out without constantly having to say, ""No, don't mess with that,"" as we would at home.  There is a separate space for 2 and under to enjoy age-appropriate toys.  The bigger-kid space offers costumes for dress up fun, a stage for performances, a farm, an auto shop, a grocery store, a police station, a house, a construction site, a treehouse, and an ice cream stand.  There is something for everyone!  We have not yet been to any events, as our little is too little to enjoy them and we do not want to take space from people who are able to do so; but they sound like a good time for kids who actually know the characters.

Review: 2UPD:
After my updated review, the owners contacted me by email and they were very kind and concerned. They offered me a free 1 time pass to this place and therefore I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Its still dusty, the surfaces are sticky, hairs are stuck to lots of the toys, but it's the staff's fault, not the owners. So, here I am, updating my review back to 5 stars. I just don't want to harm this nice family business. It's a great place for little kids to play, amazing idea and a great addition to the area. The staff is extremely friendly, but can't clean well for some reason.

UPD: We used to go there, but not anymore. The place is dirty, dusty and most of the surfaces are sticky and disgusting. The staff members are very friendly, but constantly staring at their phones and don't clean during the day.

The cutest place for toddlers ever! I wish they had longer hours. The staff is friendly. Fascinating decorations!

Review: EDITED 2/9/24: I said I would never come back here but I have eaten my words and have changed my review from 1-star to 5-stars. The new owners are amazing and have really turned this place around. They have restructured the play area, now offer snacks and coffee, and provide more supervision during play time. They even offer events each month and have extended their hours to include afternoon play times! Piney Town has gone from being the worst indoor play place around to the best, by far.

I never thought I would be writing this review or have a membership (because we are there at least once per week), but here we are.
_______________________________________________________________
THIS REVIEW WAS FOR THE PLAYHOUSE MUSEUM...BEFORE THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP.
My issue is not really with the Playhouse itself but more the culture there. We have been 3 times and the facility itself is great and the staff are always super friendly but, some parents don‚Äôt watch their kids AT ALL.

Every time we have been there has been an issue with at least one kid pushing or shoving or taking toys from other kids (just being kids), but there is no redirection or even acknowledgement from the parent.

Until today, I just chalked it up to differences in parenting and it wasn‚Äôt a deal-breaker for me. As a stay-at-home mom, I totally understand needing a break and wanting to let your kids figure things out socially for themselves. However, today, my child was playing on the fire truck and sitting in the driver seat, when a child literally picked him up out of the seat and threw him out of the truck. I removed the child from the and out my very upset toddler back into the driver seat. I told the kid that he could play there when my kid was done.

The mother didn‚Äôt come over until much later and didn‚Äôt even ask me what happened. Instead she asked me ‚Äúdid you just put your hands on my child?‚Äù and didn‚Äôt even apologize when I told her what happened.

Again, I know this is not really the fault of The Playhouse Museum, but all the same, I don‚Äôt think this place is for us and we will not be returning.

Review: We love Bumble Brews! We started coming when they had just opened and have been coming ever since. During the second year of the pandemic they were one of the few play places that were open and were instrumental in providing a since of normalcy for the parents and kids. We also had my daughters 3rd bday here and it was a blast. We rented the whole place out and it easily accommodated all of our guests.To this day whenever I am feeling cooped up in the house I go to Bumble Brews and am able to enjoy a great time with my kids as well as some much needed adult interaction. I've had so many great conversations with other moms here and met a friend who I've now been friends with for almost 3 years. I am so grateful for Bumble Brews and the role it has played in my life as a first time mom and now mom of 2. The owner is also very kind and professional too and a big reason we've continued going all these years. We've been going to Bumble Brews for about 3 going on 4 years now and needless to say it's been a special part of our lives. I'm so thankful to Blair and her husband for providing such a great place for parents and kids in our community.

One of the issues people have is their kids don't have imagination.  One issue is, maybe check when the place closes instead of just driving 30 minutes just to find out when they close.

My experience with Bumble Brews was a great place where my kids had an amazing time, dad(me) had a very nice cup of coffee, and the owner, if he isn't he's still awesome, had a good chance to shoot the breeze.  We are from Wilkesboro, but if we stay in Cary again, would definitely come back again.

Review: Bumble Brews was perfect for our son's 3rd birthday party. We had ~14 children and ~20 adults and there was room for more. The kids had a wonderful time, as expected, but the adults also really enjoyed watching their kids play without having to worry about them getting hurt or running too far away. The coffee and snacks there were fantastic. The staff was super helpful and flexible with our party and our group the entire time and made it so much easier than previous parties we have hosted at other sites. All of the feedback from party guests was extremely positive and many and planning to use this location for their next party. Highly recommend.

Review: The place is decent, but the service is terrible. We came as a group of children and moms. My friend's child was crying loudly and playing around. Eventually, a stranger's boy started bothering my friend's son, and the mother defended her child. The owner then came over and asked us all to leave because the mother of the boy who was fighting claimed that our children were aggressive. I wasn't refunded for leaving earlier (my son was calmly playing with books). The cameras in the establishment were not working, and no one bothered to resolve the situation.

Review: Bumble Brews is the best! My husband and toddler had enjoyed the location previously, but they were also able to come to our rescue as a birthday party location on short notice. Incredible experience from start to finish - kind and quality service all the way. The idea itself is just wonderful. Kids get the opportunity to play and explore the cute and clean play area while parents can get a break within view and easy reach at the attached cafe - which serves a variety of snacks and beverages. The birthday package is such a great deal - you get the dedicated space for up to 50 people. And the staff (including the lovely owner!) were so great - especially patient with the few rowdy older siblings we had attending the 4 year old focused event. Highly recommend Bumble Brews for events, playdates, or just to get out of the house! Excellent idea, beautifully executed.

Review: Bumble brews is a nice place to bring your toddlers on a rainy day. There's a good variety of pretend play toys, walker toys, mini ball pit, books and slides. Usually toys are strewn everywhere so you have to look for the one your kid likes to play with but there's so much variety that it's not a problem. It's nice that we can bring our adult drinks into the play area. Sometimes it can get very very busy though and really chaotic. The toys are suitable for kids 4-5 years of age. Some of them are a little worn and could use a battery change. Most parents and kids are really friendly and it's easy to make new parent friends there too. We had our birthday party there and it was really great to have the whole place to ourselves. They also gave us one of the party rooms to set up cake/games/decorations. All the kids really enjoyed their time at the party!

Review: Absolutely great place to go to let kids hang out and for parents to relatively chill. Great safe toys. Some things could be better like cleaning up snack tables, preventing kids from opening maintenance doors and making sure batteries are working in toys. Also can be at capacity / crowded, with parents and kids who want to get 'in' crowding the lobby where kids would otherwise be snacking. In sum just get there super early ok?

Review: Parents, listen up! This is the place to go for a break. Having a play area indoors for your kids while parents can watch from a coffee/beer/wine bar is brilliant. How are there not more of these. Please take my money. Prices are very reasonable. The facilities are very clean. My kids (aged 2 and 4) had a good time. The facility sells snacks for kids at reasonable prices too. Staff were very friendly. Kids could spend several hours here while the parents relax.

Review: The Bumble Brews owner, whom I've corresponded with via email, and staff, whom we interacted with in person, were all very friendly. The actual inside of the establishment was very bright and clean. The coffee was not good in flavor unfortunately; the specialty coffees, including the dairy free options, tasted like plain unsweetened coffee, which was a disappointment. But there are 2 reasons my son will not be returning to play at Bumble Brews.
First, the toys, on average, were more about imaginative play, such as playing kitchen/chef, rather than STEM play. Our 1.5 year old son was bored well before the 90 minute mark because none of the toys required critical thinking or a challenge. The obstacle/jungle gym equipment were impractical to use because of the mandatory sock policy. I completely understand the reasoning behind requiring socks to maintain cleanliness, but the children have no traction on wooden gym equipment, which becomes hazardous. My son recognized how slippery the wooden gym equipment was and wouldn't scale them. Perhaps adding adhesive traction grips to help with traction would be beneficial?
And my second reason‚Ä¶there was an older child (maybe 7?) who appeared to belong to one of the staff working the cafe as they engaged on a familiar level. To put it plainly, she was a bully to my son and many of the other children trying to play. She had no parent shadowing her and when speaking to other parents who frequent Bumble Brews during our visit, we were informed that she is there often and her unpleasant behavior is the norm. I have issue with this if she truly is the child to one of the staff as it made it difficult for my husband and I to relax and allow our child to roam without concern. This child frequently tried to take toys from other children, including my son, and boss them around in an inappropriate tone. If her parent was shadowing her and trying to correct the behavior, I wouldn't have an issue, but without a parent shadowing her, we worried circumstances could escalate, making it challenging to mediate as I am not her parent and do not want to overstep. So instead, my husband and I had to continuously redirect our son away from wherever this child was playing.
For these 2 reasons, our experience was just okay. It is a 30 minute drive to reach this indoor children's play place and the good we experienced in our visit does not justify the drive.

Review: We love the open play cafe. The hours are 8-1 and 4-7 and you play for 1.5 hours. If you come frequently, there is also a monthly option. Parents and caregivers can purchase delicious coffee drinks made with Larry's beans or beer or juices or sparkling water. There are juice box options for the little ones and some snack items. The seating in the front area is also great for snacks and games and then you take off your shoes and play in the open space. There are all kinds of toys, a little kitchen, a slide and other objects to climb and jump. Our 2 year old loves the space and has a big smile on his face every time we approach the door. The owner and staff are extremely welcoming and kind. You can also book parties and events. I would follow them on facebook as well for the most up-to-date closure updates and announcements.  Thank you for providing a fun and open area to play indoors!

Review: This is such a cute Cafe! We go quite often and have even had the monthly membership in the past. Sadly my almost 4 year old is outgrowing the facility and gets bored after 30-45 minutes, especially with the younger age range that is generally there during the day. The cost is SUPER affordable and the coffee is always delicious. We haven't attended the events yet since we live 30 minutes away and they're always at night but hope to try in the future.
My ONLY issue is that toys are all over. I've tripped and my girl has fallen a few times over toys dropped by the kids and then just left there. Wish it was a little more tidy. Not asking that employees helicopter the place cleaning up after kids....that's just not reasonableüòÜ but maybe like every hour or so go through and pick up toys kids aren't playing.

Review: I called and asked about open play and she said nothing about it closing in 30 minutes for a private event.  I drove my 1 year old 30 minutes and got turned away the minute we walked in for a private event.  You might want to inform customers when they call instead of wasting our time!  My toddler cried when we walked out because we couldn‚Äôt stay.  Please be more courteous and transparent, it‚Äôs really not hard.

*also the woman I spoke to on the phone was very short with me.  I did not abruptly end the call, I said thank you and she said you‚Äôre welcome and that was it!  She had every opportunity to tell me that there was a private event starting in the next hour.  What really blew my mind is that I wasn‚Äôt offered any compensation when I got there and explained how disappointed I was.  I worked in hospitality and customer service for years and I would have 100% offered the customer a gift card in this case scenario.  It was super disappointing and the whole reason I called ahead was to avoid something like this!

Blair is an amazing owner, haven't been once where she hasn't been in the building working alongside her employees. Everyone is friendly and personable. Two restrooms with changing tables as well. Forget your kiddos snack? No problem! Nice selection of kid friendly snacks and beverages too. Games, puzzles, books and coloring if the kids just want some downtime. So glad to have found this place. I share it with anyone I know.

Review: I can't say enough good things about this indoor play area! From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by how clean and well-maintained everything was. It's clear that a lot of care goes into keeping the space safe, welcoming, and fun for little ones.

What truly makes this place special, though, is Ashley. She is beyond amazing‚Äîso engaged and attentive to every child who walks through the doors. My 4.5-year-old and 2-year-old were instantly drawn to her warmth and enthusiasm. Whether she was helping them discover new activities, sparking their imagination, or simply making sure they felt welcome, her energy and dedication were undeniable.

You can tell this play area is run with love and thoughtfulness. It's organized, flows beautifully, and provides the perfect environment for kids to explore, play, and socialize. If you're looking for a top-notch indoor play space that feels more like a home than a business, this is the place!

Highly recommend‚Äîwe‚Äôll be coming back again and again!

Took my 4 and 1 year old and we all had a blast - the facility is clean, staff is kind and helpful, the toys and activities are so fantastic and give the kids opportunities to really dig in and PLAY, and they keep the capacity low enough that there were other kids for my littles to play with but none of us felt crowded. We‚Äôll be back for sure!

Review: We have always enjoyed occasions to play at this facility.  It is clean, unique, varied, and stimulating without being overstimulating.

My daughter celebrated her 4th birthday there and we paid extra to have decorations and party favors done to match the theme.  I was blown away by how beautiful and special everything was made.  It was a great time for all.

Nothing with kids is cheap these days, but Spirited Sprout provided value for the cost.

Review: My daughter recently had her birthday party here, and I 10/10 cannot recommend Spirited Sprout enough! There are various party packages to pick from, but the ""Extra Spirited Sprout"" package was worth every penny. It offered the most amount of play time for the largest group of people and Ashley took care of all the decor, place settings, party favors, setup, cleanup, etc. They know their space the best, and having them orchestrate everything was such a gift for a busy mama. They happily accommodated our special request for a party theme for our little as well! The space is so clean, organized and well thought out, and it offers a variety of play activities for children. Every single child of different ages that came to the party had such a fun time. We've also come to Spirited Sprout for a play reservation on a few occasions, which my child has loved as well. Thank you Spirited Sprout for offering such a unique and exciting space for littles to party and play!

Review: Shout out to Brad! He is so attentive and my kids all love him!

We are frequent visitors of Spirited Sprouts and it is easily my 1 yr old and 3 yr olds favorite spot! Every inch of the space is well thought out and the owners do a great job of making everyone feel like family. It is always impeccably clean and they limit the number of families allowed at one time so it is never overly crowded. Our 3 year old has also attended their summer camp which we highly recommend. Each day had a different theme with the cutest activities, crafts, etc. He is already asking to go back. We are so grateful for Spirited Sprouts and all that they do to help foster the development of our little ones!

Review: Our children LOVE Spirited Sprout! I feel safe leaving my girls with Ashley and her team. Ashely is well educated and understands sensory processing disorder. My daughter has sensory issues and when she comes home from sprouts afternoon out, she is regulated and happy. If you‚Äôre a parent of a child with SPD or autism, you know how amazing it is to drop off your kids ( without crying or fear) and know they will benefit from more than just play and return home happy!!!!. I am so grateful for Ashley and her family. They put so much love into what they do and it shows. Thank you for everything!

Review: As a former educator and now a mom to two littles, I cannot recommend Spirited Sprout, LLC enough for ALL children to enjoy a loving, clean, and well thought out sensory playground. Spirited Sprout has become a special part of our family as they have welcomed us with open arms, taught our daughter new skills, and has provided a place for our family to enjoy time outside of the home meeting other local families. The enrichment classes are incredible and such a wonderful opportunity for all learners. We highly suggest you go for a play reservation to see all of the wonderful things it offers for your child(ren). Also be sure to sign up for their email communication to receive the most recent information and classes they have offered.

Review: My daughter absolutely LOVES comes to Spirited Sprout and playing with ""Miss Ash-a-ley.""  She is a super high energy kid and is easily over stimulated.  So many play places have TVs going, music blaring, lights flashing... and for my kid this is way way way overstimulating.  Spirit Sprout is delightfully peaceful and quiet, neat as a pin and a relaxing atmosphere for kids and parents alike.

Review: Absolutely flawless‚Äî5 out of 5, 10 out of 10! From start to finish, every detail was handled with care and professionalism, allowing us to truly enjoy the day without a single worry. The pricing was more than fair, but what truly stood out was the quality, attention to detail, and genuine commitment to bringing our daughter‚Äôs dream of a Princess Unicorn party to life. With 27 kids and parents in attendance, the food was a hit, the goodie bags were perfect, and the entire experience far exceeded our expectations. We‚Äôre already looking forward to celebrating our son‚Äôs big day with you this fall. Thank you for making this such a magical memory!

Review: We registered for breakfast with Elsa which was advertised as from 9:30am-10:30am. I walked in at 10:10. I drove an hour to bring my little boy just so they could tell me they sent Elsa home early cause everyone else was done with her. There was way too many kids & costs way too much to not be able to walk around or get the Elsa breakfast that we signed up for.

Update: they did offer me a partial refund which was nice.

It's hard to come by a kids play place that is actually well maintained and clean. It's small enough that I felt comfortable letting my kids play independently and knew they were safe. They had a wide variety of toys that kept both my 18 month old and almost 6 year old well entertained. I cannot recommend this place enough!

Review: Could not recommend this place enough! We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i‚Äôm assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it‚Äôs too hot outside.

Review: We absolutely love this playground! Our kids loved it even more! (2 1/2 years old and 14 months old) They had a blast and did not want to leave! I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn‚Äôt even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend! We want to get a membership there now!

Review: I cannot speak highly enough about Jason and the incredible experience my children have had at We Rock The Spectrum in Kernersville. It is evident that Jason is a compassionate and truly caring individual who prioritizes the happiness and well-being of every child that enters the facility.

One aspect that immediately impressed me is the cleanliness of the place. The facility is always immaculate, and it's clear that great care is taken to maintain a safe and hygienic environment. The bathrooms are consistently clean, which is a big plus for parents like myself who value cleanliness and hygiene.

I particularly appreciate the mandatory sock policy at We Rock The Spectrum. It not only promotes sanitation but also ensures the safety of the children. By requiring socks, the facility minimizes the risk of slips and falls, creating a secure environment for kids to play and explore.

We Rock The Spectrum in Kernersville is undoubtedly the perfect place for children to release their energy in a safe and controlled environment. Jason's commitment to providing a space for kids to have fun and get their wiggles out is truly commendable. His dedication to ensuring the happiness and well-being of every child is evident in the positive atmosphere and joyful experiences we've always had.

If you're a parent searching for a place where your kids can play safely and have a blast, I highly recommend We Rock The Spectrum in Kernersville. Jason's compassion, cleanliness standards, and emphasis on creating a fun and secure environment make it an exceptional choice. Your children will have a fantastic time while you enjoy peace of mind knowing they're in the best hands.

I brought both of my kids there on several different occasions, and every time, he has met them with warmth, engaged with them, and created an environment that feels safe, sturdy, and connected. The atmosphere is always clean and well taken care of, and it feels like a short vacation where you can let the outside world escape and enjoy time with your kids.

There wasn't a huge crowd which I appreciated because my LO is slow to warm up and gets overwhelmed easily by a lot of people. Mr. J is kind, personable, and great with children! For 2 hours of play, the 3 class pass ($30) makes it affordable for our family. We live in NW GSO but it was worth the drive!

Review: We‚Äôve visited WRTS on many occasions and for different reasons - birthday parties, summer camp, or just to play. It truly is a place for all ages and abilities. My daughter uses a walker and needs assistance getting around. Usually she tires or gets bored within 30 minutes when we visit play areas. At WRTS, she‚Äôs been entertained for hours! And because of the range of play equipment and activities, my younger son can climb, run, and swing as much as he wants!

Fun zip line for kids that are a bit older, plenty to climb in and on and a nice enclosed trampoline as well.  Love that they offer something for everyone, whether on the spectrum or not.

Review: There are so many fun things to do here for children of all ages and abilities. My 7-year-old and 2 yr old had an absolute blast! They have a zip line that both of my kids absolutely loved! There is even a little play pizza kitchen, dolls, washer/dryer, and whole little house area set up! There is a calming area that is in a private room, away from all of the busier toys, that is perfect for children who need a quieter and calming space. This was the perfect place for a birthday party! There is a party room you can decorate and bring your own cake and food. You get to come 15 minutes before the party starts to set up. Socks are required for all, no shoes or bare feet, but you can wear your own, or you can buy a pair for $2.
It's most definitely worth the drive from Winston or Greensboro for such an amazing indoor space that is sure to be a fun filled day for all children!

Review: Amazing place, I hosted my sons second birthday party here and he had the best time ever. The little toddlers had fun and even the big kids as old as 12 had a blast. Everything was very clean and so many different toys for the toddlers to play with. The owner was very hands on and always there to help if needed.

Review: We visited for the first time today and my 3.5 year old and 9 month old just loved it. It‚Äôs hard to find a place that both of them can find something to enjoy and play with. There was a great little area where my 9month old just sat and played with toys for a long time. They had some awesome swings for kiddos his age, his favorite was the bulldozer swing. My big guy just couldn‚Äôt get enough of the trampoline and loved playing with the little pizza oven and cash register. Such a great space and so clean. The owners were so interactive with the kids! We  had a blast and will be back soon. Thanks so much for creating such a fun and safe environment for kids!

Review: Words cannot express how much we love and appreciate We Rock The Spectrum Triad. Jenny and Jay are outstanding individuals who are changing lives in this community. This gym is filled with smiles, love,  laughter, support, inclusion, and inspires confidence in kids. My son with Sensory Processing Disorder absolutely thrives here.  Swings, a zip-line, trampoline, crash pads, calm room,  toddler area-- it's perfect! My 12 month old also loves the toddler area!  We had a birthday party here and all of the kids said it was the ""best party ever!"". We're also in Summer Camp and it has been such a positive experience. Camp has helped my son grow so much and the amazing camp staff has gone above and beyond.  This gym has changed our lives for the better,  and we're so thankful.  Highly recommend for ALL kids!

Review: This is an amazing indoor facility for all kids but especially those with any sensory disorder.  There are several types of swings, a trampoline, zip line, slides and squishy (pillow) walk area.   One wall has mirrors so kids can watch themselves and another has a busy board.  There's an area with mega blocks and sliding beads and other sensory toys.  There's also a road rug and cars, mini kitchen, pizza oven,  washer/dryer, shopping cart, and so on.   Such a great judgement free place for call kids where they can be kids!

Review: Jason & Jen were so welcoming! I took my 2.5 year old son for a morning session. There is a safe play space for babies and an area with toddler toys in addition to all of the swinging, climbing, and jumping equipment. The facility also has separate spaces for parties and/or classes.

My son takes a bit to warm up to new experiences but by the end of our visit he was loving the trampoline and twirling swing. We look forward to returning during our summer visit!

Someone at the door said this was the little girls birthday and it was time for the party so the money we had spent on a present was stolen from the birthday party before. If I was the owner I would roll back the cameras and have them banned from ever coming back. You don't do that to people. People work really hard for what they have. Something needs to be done as soon as possible. (My friends daughters birthday was IVYS )

Review: DO NOT GO HERE!!! My friends girl and my girl were being scared by a little boy, we told them to ask him to stop. He didn‚Äôt listen so my friend and I asked him to stop and he still didn‚Äôt stop and then he started pushing and corning them with his arms on either side of them so they couldn‚Äôt get away! We told him that was not ok and then confronted his parents. He still pursued them and so we told his parents again. Now, non of this so far is the business fault but then the owner steps in while we were talking with his parents and says we should‚Äôve come to her and not ‚Äú yelled at her customers, that this little boy comes all the time and is just fine.‚Äù My friend says‚Äù but he is pushing our girls‚Äù and the owner just argues back and it it obvious that she is upset and that this little boy is being backed up and will not stop. so we start to leave and the owner follows us out the door, still yelling, telling us not to come back. This is not the kind of place you want to bring your kids, if this is just one instance of how the owner of the business acts! That is not ok!

Review: I‚Äôve worked in some dirty places before, but nothing compares to Just Play. After visiting Playland, it‚Äôs clear what a clean,  safe kids‚Äô space is supposed to look like.

I worked at Just Play for about a year, and I would not recommend it ‚Äî especially to parents. The toddler area in particular is filthy. There‚Äôs dust built up under the benches ‚Äî right where babies crawl and play. Snacks like Goldfish or Cheerios are always left on the ground, which is a choking hazard and completely unsanitary. Inside and under the main play structure, there are piles, PILES of dust that have clearly been there for months, if not longer.

All of this is expected to be cleaned by the staff, who are paid just $12 to $15 an hour and mostly under 18. The owner, Beth, refuses to hire professional cleaners and instead gives us cheap, ineffective cleaning tools to do the work ourselves. No matter how hard we tried, it was never enough to please her. The owner is out of touch and inconsiderate. She treated us like we were disposable and expected us to clean up years of built-up filth like it was just part of our job ‚Äî I realized that work shouldn‚Äôt be this dreading as a 18 year-old and left.

If you‚Äôre a parent reading this, I highly recommend going to Playland instead. It‚Äôs spotless, smells clean, and everything is bright white ‚Äî so you can see the difference. Your child deserves better, and so does the staff expected to care for them. Give your money to businesses that deserve it.

We must wear socks but the socks are black by the end of the two hours so the place is dirty. They were so nice to give us a pair of socks for each child but it was right before we were about to leave. :(
They put in massage chairs, claw machines and a few games you have to pay for. If I wanted to do that we would have gone to chuckie cheese.
All in all the kids had a blast but mama didn‚Äôt.

Obviously it's not much probably adds up to a few dollars but I worked days to reach those goals and now I just can't trust just play. I'm definitely telling anyone it's like a carnival buildup game it's starts great and ends with you feeling ripped off. Absolutely garbage.

Review: We took our toddler son to play here, and discovered that the staff don‚Äôt moderate access to the toddler area whatsoever. By the time we left, there were at least 5-6 kids in the toddler area who were well above toddler age (probably 7+ years old?) and throwing the foam blocks around and yelling. It's also extremely loud in here--they don‚Äôt seem to have any sound dampening, and since the walls are concretes and the ceiling is high, I had a headache after less than 2 hours between the loud music and all the screaming children.

They need more loose parts for the older children to play with, as the toddler area looked to be the only area that had blocks or balls. It seems like a lot of things are due for replacement/maintenance as well.

I would consider coming back when my son is older, but I have to say that there are nicer play areas in Charlotte that are better maintained and have more things for kids to do. If you have a kiddo who loves obstacle courses and climbing, this place has a decent selection for that. I don‚Äôt recommend it for younger children though.

I tried to order a coffee, which was on the menu, to be told that ""to be honest, neither of us know how to use that machine"". I don't know if they just didn't want to do it, or if they were training on it, but regardless, it was upsetting. My son had fun, but I feel like nothing ever gets cleaned and there are multiple safety issues

Review: TERRIBLE PLACE!!! This past weekend I was so excited to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs birthday, after purchasing from (Groupon) a birthday package. After calling and confirming the date that I needed, I was told that it was booked. Immediately I went to cancel the party package because of course it wasn‚Äôt needed at that point, and proceeded with the refund process. However, you can‚Äôt get in contact with anyone from Groupon!!! I tried calling Just Play to see if they could contact anyone to help with the process and I was told there is nothing that could be done on their end because it‚Äôs a third party, even though they are doing contracts with them to promote the deals!! I will be taking legal action, because there is no way that either company has rights to my money!!! DISGUSTING!!! Don‚Äôt waste your time or money with these FRAUDS!!!

Review: In the freezing cold, we were looking for something new for our 4 yr. old granddaughter. Drove about 50 minutes from Newton. Absolutely fantastic experience. Some reviews calling this place dirty? Absolutely not !!!!
Very clean, well organized, and supervised. Staff was very nice. Nobody‚Äôs kids were bullying others. (That‚Äôs a parenting issue by the way).
Great place. Reasonably priced. Definitely be back.

Review: Too good to be true. The workers at this indoor playground are the ones who make/keep the place feel  joyful, social and welcoming. However the owner Beth hutton would make it extremely difficult on her workers to keep it that way when she would make astonishing requests to her workers such as using a hand held vacuum and vacuuming the wall trim or using oxiclean foam on floors tiles and scrubbing till lighter color. Which could be best for the environment/guest but there‚Äôs a lack of compassion for the workers. You didn‚Äôt get professional/experienced  cleaners let alone, provide your staff with the proper equipment to complete the tasks you ask of them. Tiles on floor get socks moist/stained, unstable furniture, dust all in the play area fencing. A remodel would be a better option rather then making workers deep clean/polish everyday. Overall it‚Äôs just a gentrified park reselling dollar tree snacks. Recommend going to freedom park

Review: This shopping center has a big homeless problem and they‚Äôve begun parking outside of this Just Play location with shopping carts and pacing in front of the entrance. One homeless person perched himself on the window the last time we went and was talking to himself while pointing at the kids playing inside.
We like coming here, but it feels less and less safe every time we visit.

I don't understand how this place works, why haven't they closed them down? They don't clean there at all and don't wipe down the play surfaces. I personally am disgusted to take my child to this place

In particular, there are 2 gentlemen who are usually working and they are both AMAZING!! I don't know their names, but one of them has tattoo sleeves and the other one has long dreadlocks. They greet the kids and parents with the same warm smiles and enthusiasm every single time. They also walk around pretty frequently to make sure everyone is being safe, to clean up the seating areas, and they carry themselves so professionally. Just Play has consistently been a great place to bring our kids, so thank you!

Review: We (me and my 2 year old daughter) had a great time here on a Sunday afternoon, it was a little crowded, and hectic. But what do you expect in a room full of kids. You just have to stay close by to your child. Or at least I did because anything can happen. They had food, drinks, & snacks (bags of chips, pizza, chicken nuggets, pretzels, soda, & candy). It was a great time for us. My 2 year old had an absolute blast. And I loved that there was a section for my toddler to play in and not get trampled by all the other sugar rushed youngins. Everything seems well maintained & clean for the most part. The employees were nice and had smiles on their faces. Clean bathrooms and padded floors. Good prices & monthly memberships. This is not a place for the parent to come relax. This is a place for the children to come have fun. And that's exactly what happened. If your a parent and care about your child. You need to be with them and watch them to keep them safe. Its not the staffs job to watch your child for you. It's the parents job. I've seen other posts about this place where a child was hurting another child, or pushed them or something. (Kids will be kids)  That's why you need to be with your child at all times! And the fault lies not with the venue, but with the parent of the mean child. If this occurs. I won't be dealing with the venue. I'll be dealing with that child and their parents myself. That's what anyone should do in that situation. With that being said. It would be cool to have attentive staff. But I understand places get crowded. And there might not be enough staff available. Long story short. We had fun. And we will return whenever we have the time. üòÅ

Review: First impression was this place is crowded but then it was still cold outside so perfect for the kids to play inside, there were lots of fun stuff to keep them occupied for a few hours (2 hrs) tickets. Place was generally clean including restrooms, only issue I had was that the flooring transitions are not marked or colored (highlighted) the kids seem to have a good fun time here. There is also a  snack counter and refreshments on sale. Pack your own little bags and don‚Äôt forget your socks it‚Äôs $3.50 per sock. There were adequate seating and chairs. Nice play for the kiddos to hang out but use more fun activities.

Review: My son and I really enjoyed this place. He‚Äôs only 2, and even at his young age the toddler section was very enjoyable for him; he must‚Äôve gone down that slide quite seriously thirty or forty times! He loved playing with the foam blocks, and going to the higher areas of the structure as well.

They had clean facilities (he needed a diaper change) and had dedicated diaper disposal so it didn‚Äôt stick up the room. The whole place was actually surprisingly clean and seemed to me to be very well maintained.

It‚Äôs not expensive, but if you go more than once a month the yearly membership is a great option, and we might have to look into it. Workers and all the other parents and kids present were friendly and it seemed like a safe environment.

Review: I regret to share that my experience hosting a birthday party for my child at the play area was less than satisfactory. The party attendant appeared to be inexperienced and struggled with basic responsibilities:

1. I was informed I need to purchase a $5 pitcher of water, despite the package including two pitchers.

2. After clarifying, the attendant brought the water but forgot cups, plates, and utensils. I had to request these separately, specifying quantities.

3. Unfortunately, I found myself unexpectedly managing party supplies instead of enjoying the celebration, contrary to our expectations that the attendant would handle such tasks.

4. When it came time to serve pizza, the attendant simply left plates and pizza boxes without offering assistance. When I inquired about serving hungry kids, her response suggested surprise at my request.

5. There was no help in setting up the table for cake cutting, and I ended up serving the cake without assistance. (There is no private room . It is just a private open spot , which is okay)

6. The attendant was often at the counter helping other customers rather than focusing on our party needs.

7. Despite requesting a party attendant, I was met with confusion. The attendant insisted she was there to help, but her actions suggested otherwise.

8. The pizza size was inadequate for five kids, leaving everyone unsatisfied.

Despite these challenges, the saving grace was the manager's responsiveness. She patiently listened to my feedback during checkout and offered compensations such as 2-hour free play coupons and a discount on additional pizza. While the manager's actions were commendable, the overall experience fell short of expectations.

Review: I recently celebrated my daughter's 3rd birthday at Just Play and it was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a party venue (which I guess isn't saying that much since she is only 3 lol but hear me out...)

I was assigned a party planner but then another young man insisted that he wanted to be the host - since he was so anxious I agreed. Turns out he was very inexperienced - long story short the pizzas were brought out too early (some of my guests hadn't even arrived yet) I had to fight for a fresh order so the kids wouldn't be eating cold food. I had to fight for extra plates, forks and napkins and when they finally did arrive they didn't even match my color scheme. I had to ask several times for them to make an announcement for my guests to come to the area for the party, I had to literally go to Big Lots next door to purchase my own hand sanitizer (which delayed everyone eating). I had to serve the pizza myself - using forks because they couldn't be bothered to assist. And to make matters worst my ""party host"" couldn't find a lighter. He said I had to get everyone on my own to sing happy birthday and cut the cake and I had to ask all of the dads if they had matches. My sweet baby loves to pretend and ""blow out"" candles but it almost didn't happen. Luckily my original planner was able to find a lighter for me.

The point of having a party at a venue like this is so that the parents could relax - I couldn't do that. I had my own plates, had to buy my own hand sanitizer, had to serve the food and beg someone for a lighter. For all of that I could just have a party at home. Will never host a party here again. My friends were the ones helping me clean up at the end!

The manager tried to make things right (charged for a party of 10 instead of 15) so I appreciate her effort but I am still so upset by how much I had to work for as much as I paid to have my ""party host"" do his job.

Review: This place is HORRIBLE!!! Don't get trapped in the monthly subscription. If you try to take your child to play on the weekend (when most parents get the chance because they work during the week) 9 times out of 10 when you get there and walk in and your child sees all the other children playing they will tell you that you and your child CANT come in because they are filled to capacity and they have also have birthday parties scheduled ALL DAY so there's not going to be any time available for your child to come play. When you ask to cancel your subscription because the last 4 times you've tried to come you've been turned away they will tell you that there's a 1-800 number you have to call to cancel your subscription and they conveniently DO NOT have that number for you EVER!!! So I go online to see if I can find the number and all I can find is something telling me I can cancel my subscription if I pay for the following 2 months right now but that's it there's no option to do that and there's definitely not a phone number anywhere to cancel anything. If you have the convenience of going during the early day on a week day you might enjoy this place and be lucky enough to actually go INSIDE and play but if your free time is on the weekends then don't bother. Save your time and money.

I bring my granddaughter quite often and these are all new faces and not d friendly at all . I saw Emily the full 2 hours sweeping and wiping down tables . Hopefully they will do better next time or I‚Äôll ensure my granddaughter gets food and drink beforehand, the woman on the photo is the manager in black who was at the register and when I walked up after she was finished with the customer walked away with 2 others, outside of the staff‚Äôs unprofessionalism my granddaughter had a  great time!

Review: Could not say enough good things about this business.  They were all booked up for parties but offered a night party as a solution and it worked great. The party room was perfect and we were able to decorate how we wanted. Garrett was our host and he was awesome. My little and her guests are still talking about it.

Review: This place is amazing. So many things to do. My problem is. To many older kids running to fast in there. I brought my grandson in today. He was excited about everything. Until he wasn't. Not the fault of the other kid  accidents happen. They have this wrecking ball you can swing on. We were getting ready to go in the ball pit they have. The opening to the ball pit is way to close to where the kids can swing. So my 19 month old grandson got hit in the head, by this kid swinging. Plus the kid didn't even say sorry. Parents r supposed to be watching their kids. Like I said it was an accident. But not teaching the kids to say sorry, and not watching your kid as well. But we won't be back for a while unless theyu have age group for kids set up. The owner gave me an ice pack that wasn't even cold. I shared with her what happen and she just kinda said ""O"". Just thought it could be handled better. But again cool place. Just not for the young ones. If you want to run go to the rec centers or to the parks.

I also like how some areas encourage independent play for the littles while others are setup for parents to join in on the fun and really play with the kids! The whole space is clean, well kept, and feels open even though each play area feels like it is it's own space. So well managed! My 5 and 3 year old love it here and ask to go to open play weekly, lol!

Review: Always an absolute blast! This play place is mostly geared toward the younger set. Probably under age 10 but it depends on how much your kid enjoys imaginary play. My four and six year olds absolutely adore it. The play areas change around periodically but there‚Äôs usually a vet center, play kitchen/grocery store, a magic spell booth, puppet show, and a few small games (skee ball, fooseball, basketball) in the back plus a foam pit, small ball pit, trampoline, and a variety of ninja foam blocks to jump and a roller slide and mountain to climb. Also the front area has one of those interactive coloring areas that animates your drawing on a big projector screen. Plus some tables full of building toys. There are plenty of places to sit and chat with other parents while staying within range of your kids. I‚Äôm always impressed with how clean they‚Äôre able to keep it and how chill the vibe usually is. At our last visit they added a new room full of airtoobz machines which kept my four year old busy for most of the play session. They also added a ‚Äúsnowball fight‚Äù area where you could pelt each other with tiny fluffy balls. I ended up in there with both my kids and nephew having the best time. It‚Äôs a really great place to go let your kids have a fun without being overstimulated and blasted in the face with screens and lights and ending the day in a meltdown. It gives wholesome playdate vibes and I just adore it. It‚Äôs really what the children‚Äôs museum in Portsmouth wishes it could be. If you‚Äôre a family with a quiet calm child it‚Äôs amazing. If you‚Äôre a family with a wild animal child climbing the walls and trying to parkour off every surface in your home it‚Äôs amazing. Bring em both. They‚Äôre gonna love it.

The variety of physical play (foam pit, ninja jumping), imaginary play (pet shop, wizardry, pirates), and interactive floor and wall space was great. We found it very clean too.

Review: 10/10 recommend! Great play place for all ages, including adults. Great customer service & the kids always have fun (they love the gifts they get when leaving). The Open Play sessions are held at convenient times. The birthday party set up and experience is seamless and we will be having our twins next birthday here & can‚Äôt wait for all their friends to try it out. The Ninja Warrior class is for ages 6-10, which our kids can‚Äôt attend yet but look forward to signing them up for it. The private rentals are great for daycares, summer camps & school with a reasonable price. The one year anniversary party is coming up next week & my kids are excited to try out the new inflatable balloon bubble house. There is even a black Friday sale of punch cards giving 50% off open play admission, which we will be taking advantage of. Overall, this is a great place to take kids of all ages to have fun & run out some energy. Give it a try, you won‚Äôt regret it! :)

This place came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others. The activities are versatile and suit all ages. The adults even have fun. The reason I have rated The Play Spot 5 stars is because it is unique, CLEAN, and they always have something new to play with.  If you're looking to have fun with the whole family, this is the spot!

The policy that has parents stay was strange to begin with, but I think the parents had more fun than the kids. Amber, our host, was so helpful and made all the families feel very welcomed.

We highly recommend The Play Spot for parties and for even a play spot!

This place could accommodate around 15 kids for the party and it was way better than previous parties at large play places because it was more than just a play ground (in my opinion).

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: This place was wonderful for a larger space to run and jump and climb on the rainy days! They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

The extra hands with setup/cleanup was a godsend. Everyone had a blast and we are already planning  for another birthday in Sprouts next year!  HUGE SHOUT OUT to Jada and Garryin at Sprouts for making this birthday a fantastic experience for all!

I do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Not has now been almost two weeks and my last follow up email was met with the response of, ‚Äûwhat gift certificates.‚Äú I so frustrated because there goes $45 down the drain and one of the families it was intended for are stuck in a hotel with two toddlers.

Review: I take my daughter a couple times a month to play and interact. It's only $15 for her to play with all their toys and indoor playground equipment all day as long as she wants. I asked about the daycare they offer and after a lot of thought I decided I'd give it a try. The day I went in for drop off, Z was working. She gave me so much assurance, and texted me updates throughout the 2 hours my daughter was there. Z knew I was nervous and went above and beyond to give me comfort and assurance. She treated my baby (17 months) like she's known her her whole life. I was pleasantly surprised when i got back to my daughter refusing to leave, which she's never done before. I can see that my daughter had fun and that Z doesn't do just the bare minimum. Later that evening she even texted me saying that my daughter made her day, which was another thoughtful surprise. Would 100% recommend. I have no experience with the other workers other than the regular play days, which has also been a nice experience.. But I would feel very comfortable and confident trusting Z with my daughter. The 2 hours she spent with her made a positive impact. Very glad I went in on the day I did.

Review: I wanted to share my recent experience regarding our reservation for my son's birthday. While the lady who assisted us initially was friendly and accommodating, the follow-up call for confirmation was quite unpleasant. This caller claimed to be the one who helped with our reservation, which was not the case.

The original representative said it would be ok to arrive 10 minutes early for setup, despite the contract stating setup time was included. I've had friends celebrate at this venue, and they've been allowed those few extra minutes without extra charges. This isn't our first birthday party, and we've never encountered issues with early setups before. I am not saying 20-30 minutes prior; I am talking 10 minutes prior.

I understand that rules exist for a reason, but a little kindness can really enhance the customer experience. I suggest the management consider adjusting the scheduling to allow parents a few extra minutes for setup before guests arrive.

Review: I have a mixed review of this place but still giving 4 stars because my guests and kid's enjoyed it. I recently had my kid's joint bday party there Saturday 8/17. Positives- The employee that day (I forgot her name) was extremely helpful and kind. She was always checking in to see if we were ok and needed anything. I greatly appreciated that. Tons of activities for kids to do and they had SO MUCH FUN! The party room is nice but would not realistically seat 30 people at one time. It was a little crowded inside the party room.

Negatives- The entire facility on the weekends is reserved for private parties only from 9-2. There is a set amount you pay for a certain amount of hours and then $50 for each additional 30 mins. This does NOT include set up or breakdown time. I booked the space for 10am-1:30pm. Therefore, no one could have a party before or after me. The party was 11am-1pm. In my opinion, set up time and breakdown should be included. I should not have to pay an additional $100 to get there at 9am to set up when I have already reserved the space for the party. Trying to rush and set up in 1 hour was extremely stressful and a buzz kill. Additionally, the AC was not on when we arrived at 10 so we were sweating carrying in boxes, setting up, etc. For this reason of no set up time included, I do not think I will be having another party there. I really hope the owner considers adding in free set up time. I have heard in the mom's Facebook groups that many are deciding against having their party there because they think that is unfair.

Review: I love this place, great for kids, but some of the toys need upgrade, my son was a little bored last two times we were there. I definitely recommend frequent cleaning throughout the day because the playing space gets dirty even though we‚Äôre not allowed to wear the shoes inside.
I‚Äôll continue to take my son there and hope to see some updates üòä

Your littles will not want to leave when it‚Äôs time to go so prepare for a fit when it‚Äôs time to go.  The prices for snacks and play is very reasonable.   They do celebrate holidays and do pics with Santa as well as story time, summer camp, Hola Friends, activities and so much more. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone that needs a break to lounge while their children play.  You can see your children play while sitting down and relaxing.  Worth a visit !!

Review: The price combined with all the restrictions and employee attitudes is ridiculous. My niece‚Äôs party was this past Sunday 03/06/2022, my sister in law and a friend did a combined party. This was both of their daughter‚Äôs first birthday. They originally booked the space for 2 hours from 11:30 - 1:30pm. My sister-in-law was told that the set up and clean up time were included in the 2 hour booking time. The two hour time slot before theirs was not booked, despite this an additional 30 minutes was booked for $50 to ensure there was enough time to set up. Even though she paid for the additional 30 minutes she was unable to bring more than two people with her to set up because they did not want the equipment used. Why did that matter if she paid for the time slot. My sister-in-law got to the place at 10:30 to try to blow up some of the balloons in her car. An employee then came out to the parking lot informing my sister-in-law that she was not able to enter the building until 11 am even though no one else had rented the area before her. The employee explained this by stating that she was sweeping the area. My sister-in-law saw her grab a broom and pretend to sweep for 30 minutes. Overall, the party costed around $400 for 2 and 1/2 hours. 30 of those minutes were used to decorate the area. While the party was fairly enjoyable the stress of the strict time limits made it difficult for my sister-in-law to fully enjoy the party. I understand that the parties are booked for a specific amount of time for a reason. What I don‚Äôt understand is why an additional $50 had to be paid for 30 minutes when there was no party booked in the slot before. If you pay for the time I also don‚Äôt understand why there is a limitation on the amount of people you can bring with you. Overall, this place is way overpriced for all of the rules and restrictions that were given to my sister-in-law. We will never book this space again for any reason. Overpriced and underwhelming with rude employees.

Review: My 7 year old son and I love Bravery Gym.  There are a lot of things for the kids to do there.  Jungle gym, swing, sensory room, and movie room.  It is a woman/veteran owned business.  This facility has two uses. The first is drop in childcare and you can also bring your child to play as you sit and watch.

The staff are super friendly, and the whole place is clean.

My son was there once with no other children and Mrs Marcella did science experiments with him and kept him busy the whole time.

The only bad thing about this place is there are no other locations.

I spent almost two hours in this gym, and my daughter had to be convinced she was tired and hungry in order to leave. Long story short, I was the one burned out lol. But She slept liked a log when it was time for bed time.I highly recommend this place for little ones to get exercise and play, especially on a rainy day.  Plus they get to interact with other children, which is a good thing for children who are the only child. We will definitely be going back.

I was looking for somewhere to take him to release all his pent up energy.! (Too cold and wet for the playgrounds). Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny.. Ideal place to stop by if you have children that love imaginative and interactive playtime!

Review: My friend and I visited each with 3 kids 4 and younger. It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue ""Elsa"" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!

Review: My Daughters birthday was yesterday and we went to play with a friend as one of her fun things! She absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs perfect for kids! They can run and slide and play and be loud if they want too! That‚Äôs what being a kid is all about!! The owner was super friendly,  we had the best time, and she didn‚Äôt want to leave! We are having her actual birthday party here at the end of the month and we cannot wait! ü©∑

Review: The place was amazing and set up very well and my son really enjoyed his self and I know kids it just kids but the owners kids one of them kept yelling at my son and the other one kept trying to pick him up and pull on him and she than proceeded to try to force my son to go down the slide pulling him onto and I kept having to tell her to stop and not to pull or hold on him. But other than than the place was really nice just not sure if it‚Äôs the place for me if something like that happens every time

Review: Took my son there today to check it out and was not disappointed! The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.

Review: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if you know to expect it.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

Review: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.

Review: Good place to take your rabbits on crack. This location specifically has the much beloved zip line and huge jungle gym.
Only downside is in the back of the whole thing there's a section of the jungle gym that opens up and it's just a couple steps to a drop. Safety concern there, but generally kids are smart enough to avoid it or just get bad vibes.
Oh and their arcade is whack, but you really ain't going there to play with the arcade so no deductions there.

Review: If you‚Äôre curious about having a birthday party here, here are the things you need to know. It‚Äôs lengthy.. sorry üôÉ

Time: We had a birthday party for our son and let me tell you the time frame they give you for the room is NOT worth it. They don‚Äôt serve the pizza until after 30 minutes so you have 45 minutes to get through the pizza, sing hbday, do the cake, & presents, get every body out of the room and get everything packed up and get out of the room yourself. Play time is until they close so that‚Äôs beneficial but you did pay for everyone already so it‚Äôs actually expected.

Food: pizza is from papa John‚Äôs and is very good!

Fees: if you get sick or have an emergency and need to reschedule, they fee you $50. Children get sick all the time so you would think they would be understanding being a kids place but they very much not understanding and do not care at all.
There is also a $75 fee if you go over the party room time for every 5 minutes over. We were all stressing trying to get through everything to be able to get out in time especially since they don‚Äôt let you in early to decorate or set up the food and cake, ect and don‚Äôt serve you immediately either so  you wait 30 minutes before you get the pizzas to eat so you really only have 45 minutes total for everything.

Things included: they say decorations and plates and napkins are included. We received table clothes, a happy birthday sign, and only 10 plates and napkins. The juice boxes are the capri suns and they only give you 10. The reservation is for 10 kids and 15 adults so you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd give you more options or atleast waters for everyone. Good thing there‚Äôs a grocery store near by or the adults will starve and not have anything to drink or eat on because just like us, you will need it to go buy yourself more plates, napkins, cups & drinks.

Viruses/sicknesses: be prepared to get sick if coming. We managed to get the flu the week of our son‚Äôs birthday and had to reschedule. When we reached out to the owners to let them know we were all sick, the options the owners gave us were‚Ä¶
Option 1: keep the date because they said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to lose your $300 this weekend if you don‚Äôt show up‚Äù  Yet, they knew we were all sick with the flu‚Ä¶ and still wanted us to come in so they would ‚Äúlose‚Äù out on our money.. I find it very irresponsible of these owners to sit there and say that to a parent.
Option 2: pay additional fees ontop of our $300 we spent for 1 hour rental of a room. Which really is 45 minutes when you actually get to start eating.

As a parent, we obviously rescheduled and ate the cost because we in no way would want to get the other kids sick and we obviously didn‚Äôt feel well ourselves but to know the owners are willing to send people there knowingly with the flu not caring that it will get all the other kids sick is disgusting.  We usually come every month with friends and family but I think this will be our last time knowing now what we do. They‚Äôre so desperate for an extra $50 they lost a lot more from us in the long term.  We know kids get sick and we try to have fun and be safe but now knowing you‚Äôre intentionally letting people come in sick because you allow people to keep their reservations when they tell you they‚Äôre sick instead of simply rescheduling them to keep everyone safe without fees attached is bad business and it‚Äôs gross.

Review: We celebrated our granddaughters birthday recently.  The kids love safari nation, and it's a very safe, clean play experience for them.
The birthday packages are very expensive and stressful though.  They don't allow you into your party room until 10 mins before the party, which makes it hard to set up, supervise and greet the guests as they arrive.
Thank goodness our pizza arrived on time (we've been to other parties where the pizza is very late), but it still left us rushing through pizza, birthday song, cake, and presents.  You must vacate the room at the end of your time or you will be charged an extra $75.  It was pretty stressful to get everything out in time and I couldn't help but think it stressed the kids too.
Also, they really need things for the adults to do!

Review: I don‚Äôt recommend anyone buy a monthly pass for a child for a birthday present. The date the pass is purchased the pass expires 30 days from that date whether it is used or not. My son‚Äôs Grandfather purchased a monthly pass for him and wasn‚Äôt told that the monthly pass had an expiration date on it before even being used one time. The pass was purchased on 3/30/24. I wasn‚Äôt able to take my son until 4/27/24, so my son lost 27 days from his birthday gift. The worker told me that my son‚Äôs pass would expire on 4/29/24 and if I wanted to purchase another month I could do so. So my son receives a monthly pass for a birthday present and he can only use it for 3 days now because we weren‚Äôt told it needed to be used immediately!!!!

Review: Leaving this place after a friend‚Äôs birthday party with a major headache- and not because of the kids‚Äô chatter- but the unnecessary noise from one of the ‚Äútoys‚Äù in the play area. The volcano makes so much LOUD, unnecessary noise and it goes off constantly so there is no rest from it while watching your kids play. Also the men‚Äôs restroom needed toilet paper while we were there. A friend ended up having to use paper towels to wipe with while there. Not pleasant! Other than these things, the kids had a blast so that‚Äôs a plus.

Its a shame that in this day and time people are saying dont say anything to my kid. When they are doing something that could hurt themselves. Well i guess they will feel better when their child is grown up and they are looking down a barrow of a gun because no one can tell there child anything. Dont get me wrong if it was done in a bad way i would have agreed with him but it wasnt. But before all that the kids have a great time .

Review: I came here with my 2 year old son on a Friday during winter break. We arrived right when they opened and little did we know that the place would soon be taken over by lots of older kids from the Y. All the commotion from all those kids did overwhelm my son at times, but we still managed to have fun. I appreciated how large their 4 and younger section was and there were 2 slide options. I wish there was staff regulating that area a little more as some of the older kids did attempt to play in the area. With the larger playground, there was a good variety of slides and activities. However, there are some areas that need to be fixed as you could see things were falling apart after lots of wear and tear. There is a section where you can shoot soft balls and my son was scared of that noise and it was going off often. I appreciated that you could bring outside food, but not sure why you cannot bring outside drinks. Overall, it can be a hit or miss on how busy it is so you just take that risk when you go. Also it truly depends on your child if they will like that type of environment.

Review: My kid likes it here. They usually avoid opening the zip line. When they do, it seems like the employees are arguing over who's turn it is or isn't to operate it. There's one girl (I should have got her name - not the one always in the hat) that always goes above and beyond to be sweet to the kids when she operates the zipline. If the girl in the hat and the man are there, they don't bother opening it. Instead, they pretend to sweep at the start of every hour. If by the off chance they do open it, it's at 15-20 minutes after and keep it open for 10 or 15 minutes only.

Review: Today was my sons 4th birthday party, and I will never use safari nation again. I called and asked about my reservation and they confirmed that they had the color green wrote down and that I could only have 10 minutes to decorate with my stuff. I also asked when they ordered their pizzas so I could make sure mine was ready at the same time. They told me they would be ready at 2:15, I got there and they literally made me wait till right at 10 minutes to get in the room (I saw other families that got in while the members were cleaning from prior parties) then i get in the room and they didn‚Äôt have any of the green things out. So the 10 minutes I did have pushed me further back, and had my guest watch me set everything up. I was given the room with no instructions. They didn‚Äôt give me the juice boxes till 20 minutes before my party was over and the pizza got there with 30 minutes left in the room. You only get one hour in the room. I‚Äôm thankful I had juice and pizza for the kids or we would have literally been sitting there till half way when the room time  was over. My child‚Äôs name wasn‚Äôt wrote on the door for my guests to even know where to go. There was signs on the table telling me to tip my party attended but I had no attended the whole time- I was even told that an attendant came with my package- I had no one helping the whole time. When I asked about it, they said I had to request one and that no one would really be in there much anyways. The staff were very rude and acted like we were a bother. When you spend almost 400 dollars, I expect so much more. I have had several parties at other facilities, and will definitely use those. It was embarrassing to me, and even some of the people at the party that are members of safari nation. We will not be back.

Review: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if you know to expect it.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.

There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

Review: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!

Review: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Had we not already paid to play, I would have walked out. The entire facility felt unclean and poorly maintained. I paid $24 expecting a fun, safe environment for my kids, but it felt like a complete waste of money. We left within 20 minutes of our play time and we won‚Äôt be coming back. Megaplay seriously needs to address these issues.

There ONE child currently in there playing. ONE! There are two parents with him. So, there are literally twice as many parents, including the staff, three times as many adults as children here. Still, our child can't come in, and we can't wait inside either for some odd reason. ""You have to come back at 12:45"" we are told. I point out the ONE child thing. Nope, come back at 12:45. I'm informed these rules ""are strictly enforced and have been since covid"". So, I asked ""why have we not been turned away and told to come back at a designated time the last THREE times are three year old randomly decided she wanted to go there""? With a straight face, the girl behind the counter tells me, ""well, it depends on who the staff members are that are that are working that day as to if the 'rules are enforced'"". Have you ever tried to explain to a three year old, who's now throwing a fit because she can't play, that she has to go somewhere else and can't play because the wrong staff member is working that day? One last try. ""Ma'am, there's one other kid in here, she's all excited to play, no one has ever mentioned this to us before"".  Nope, come back at 12:45. ONE kid! I have no problems with there being rules. I do have a problem that only ONE staff member chooses to enforce them or even make them known. I do have a problem that we were allowed to pay and play three previous times and out of the 5 maybe 6 other staff members we've met, none of them ever mentioned these ""strictly enforced"" rules.
TLDR;
1)Whether or not your child can play without an appointment in a building with ONE other child, COMPLETELY depends on which staff members are working that day.
2)We did NOT return at 12:45
3)You are not allowed to use the restroom to change a toddlers diaper unless you pay. You can't pay until 12:45.

Review: Had the worst experience ever. I booked the party room for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party and when we arrived‚Ä¶. It was a TOTALLY different theme. All of the guests were in mini mouse attire and the room was decorated with Moana. I was so embarrassed. The staff went to the back and found 1 pack of mini mouse plates and 2 pack of napkins and offered to ‚Äúdecorate‚Äù with those items. They offered to refund me the $30 for decorations and a refund for the 3 EXTRA PIZZAS(that i did not order) to my reservation. Nothing could replace the special day that we were all looking forward to. Also the employees rushed us out of the party room smh.

I thought it was very disrespectful and stupid how she said she would call the cops on us because our kid didn't want to play in the big slides. Me and my family are never going back to that dirty place. Mind you it was empty there was only two families there and my family was on of them.

Review: Good morning, I am formally filing a complaint against the Jacksonville, North Carolina Megaplay location. I took my daughter to megaplay early January around 11:30  when I was told from an employee to come back
In 15 minutes as there where three parties going on. My daughter and I then proceeded to wait the 15 minutes which it is now 11:45, come back as to where I was greeted by another employee who stated they have reached the maximum capacity and I could not check my daughter in to play until 5pm at night which was an enormous inconvenience for myself and my 5 year old daughter who was in tears leaving as I had to explain to her that she could not play. I cannot understand how this kind of business can accept employees that toy with children‚Äôs emotions like that. And I will post this review on every social media platform so they know the kind of standard that is being held at the Megaplay Jacksonville, North Carolina location. What a disgrace. Zero stars if I could.

Review: 3 stars due to cost and needed maintenance and upkeep.

My daughter (3 years old) absolutely loves Megaplay. She has more fun here than she does at Zing Zumm and Altitute, both of which we have memberships for.

That said, I think Megaplay is prohibitively expensive as a place to take my daughter. Zing is $100 for an entire year, and for her and I to jump at Altitude 7 days a week for 2 hours at a time it's $40 a month. At Mega, there is no monthly option, so taking her just 3 times a month is as expensive as Altitude unlimited visits.

Can we get a membership option like everywhere else?

As for maintenance, the junglejims have many spots missing padding, covered in duct tape, equipment removed likely due to damage. The bounce houses have airleaks and tape all over.

I'm not posting this to bash, we really love it and would really love if we could go more often and see some much needed repairs. Thank you and please think about it!

Review: Just wanted to share what could‚Äôve been a scary situation. I took my kids here because it‚Äôs always a great time and my youngest is almost 3 years old. He was in the big jungle gym and I was with him. Well another kid bulldozed into him (not so mad about that bc kids will be kids) what I was and am furious about is the fact that he almost fell from almost the ceiling height to the ground level on the ground. If I wasn‚Äôt there he would‚Äôve 100% fell to the ground from up there.
Pictured below is the netting he was gripping onto before the incident happened. When he fell from another kid running into him he was completely under the netting except for his head, I pulled him up immediately and I checked to see if I was being dramatic or not and I was in fact not being dramatic. The net was completely open and any child would have fallen to the ground especially smaller children. This is not safe and should be better handled. Fix this so it doesn‚Äôt happen again or worse.

Review: On 11/15/2024 at approximately 10:02AM My son & I visited Mega play's Center. I am writing this review to raise awareness about discrimination faced by children with developmental delays during playtime. Office Manager of Megaplay left her office door open leaving a safety hazard to all children in this establishment my son entered her office to play on her play rug and we were verbally attacked by this Manager screaming for us to ""get out of her office"". I immediately attempted to explain my son is Autistic and this door should be closed. We were kicked out and I asked for a refund before I would leave. The Manager did grant this refund while speaking in a tone and demeanor not professional or fit for any type of leadership. As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which ensures disabled children have equal access to play and recreational activities my sons experience suggests that such principles were not upheld.  On behalf of my son, I would like to emphasize the need for this environment to become more nurturing and increase the ability for children to be able to thrive here. I am disappointed in my experience both women in this business lacked professionalism. maturity, and the ability to run an establishment properly by using conflict resolution this is a vulnerable child. You kicked him out because he entered your office and then screamed at a parent? I'm mortified...I ask anyone in this community don't allow your children to be treated like this. This business is unsafe, and follow-up will be taken to determine ratio per employees, cleanliness, and overall ability to operate properly. Staff training and creating a more inclusive environment should be required for this establishment to continue to operate.

Also had an older sibling go into the toddler area to help my toddler get off something and she was told to get out she wasn't playing in the area just helping her sibling quickly so i don't understand that either. They‚Äôre loosing money with the set play times I saw plenty of people come in and then leave because they‚Äôre told the next play time starts in 45 minutes or whatever.

Review: We rented the party room at Megaplay for my daughter‚Äôs 7th birthday this year. I am someone who really struggle with perfectionism and people pleasing. Thanks to this, party planning means a lot of stress for me. The folks at Megaplay were so kind and accommodating from the first moment I called. They had no problem answering every question I had before booking the room. They also explained clearly the fees and accommodations. In addition, they never made me feel uncomfortable or like an inconvenience for needing more clarification or for asking a second or third time. They also confirmed my time slot and accommodations twice before the date of the party. They made it clear they would do all the decorating all I had to do was drop off my supplies, and there was even an option to have them go buy the supplies for you (for an additional charge.)

All of that is great alone, but the staff really went above and beyond to support me. My daughter woke up sick the day of her party and I frantically called crying and defeated that everything was ruined. Not only did Megaplay have no problem rescheduling me, but the staff went out of there way to offer me reassurance and support that everything would be okay. Not as a customer, but as a stressed out mom thinking way too hard about a pokemon party. The reschedule affected the guest turnout pretty badly and I was fretting around in circles most of the party. Josh and Joyanna were right there for me the entire time. They checked with me every few minutes to make sure I was doing okay. They let me take the reins wherever I felt comfortable, but had no probably helping me direct the flow of the party in my stressed out state. I cannot count the number of times they told me ‚Äúif you need anything at all please don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know.‚Äù

The sincerity of the staff at Megaplay made every difference in the world for me. Thank you so much to Josh and Joyanna for having next level customer support. It was so clear my experience mattered to them as a person not just a customer. They were really able to help turn my entire mood about the party around. I‚Äôm so grateful this is where we chose to celebrate and I would give more stars if I could. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Review: Came here with family visiting. It was very empty, felt very dirty. As we were sitting and watching our children play, we seen the staff standing on tables to decorate for the party the next day, never cleaned the table off, wearing dirty shoes where families place their food at for their parties. When we had the teenagers helping the toddlers in the toddle area, the workers played the voice over saying they weren‚Äôt allowed to be in there, yet no one was in the building other than us & we were sitting next to them‚Ä¶ but instead of being nice & polite they rudely continued to play the sound seeing that the teenagers were just helping.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. It was my first time there and I would never bring my family back or myself. Save your money and go elsewhere.

Review: I had been taking my son here for years up until the last time we came a couple years ago. They decided to turn off the inflatable with my son in it even though they knew he was in there, and even saw us standing at the end of it trying to get him to come out of it. I reached out and asked for management but never heard back. Then my son asked to go again on his birthday on the 20th and we took him. We were super surprised to find that it was absolutely disgusting on the inside. All the inflatables hardly held my 29lb daughter and were all taped but still leaking air. The bridge at the top of the play place had a screw that was barely holding on and was bent. Then when I went to the front desk to buy drinks for my kids I could not find the lady that was up there till my fianc√© pointed out that you could see the top of her head as she was sitting down below the counter on her phone. I tried getting her attention said hello and excuse me, but it wasn‚Äôt till the phone rang that she got up a couple minutes later. It really does suck because my kids love it here but now we gotta find a new place to take them.

Review: I've taken my son to play at Mega play several times now. During covid, they were on top of keeping it pretty clean. They stopped play time every hour to walk through and sanitize.  The equipment has always been a bit worn out, but this last visit, I was blown away. They have let this place go all the way downhill. 2 days after visiting this place, my son came down with a high-grade fever.

When we first arrived, the only thing I noticed was how HOT and muggy it was inside. Smelled like moldy gym socks. My son was too excited to turn back, so we continued.  My son is only 40 pounds, and he was the only child in the whole building. The bounce house he first picked could barely stay inflated with just him on it. Lots of holes and tape to patch these inflatables up.  And dirt. Lots and lots of dirt.

In the jungle gym maze part, there is pure filth. Candy wrappers, dirt,  drippings of God know what, and HAIR EVERYWHERE.  Lots of spots in the maze need to be fixed properly before someone gets seriously hurt. DUCT TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING.  Mind you, we were the first ones there for the day.  So surely there were plenty of hours to clean before the next batch of children came in. There are signs all over saying, "" If your child shows any sign of being sick, please inform the staff immediately.""  Well, it's 2 days later, my son is very sick, and the only place we were was mega play.

I understand that businesses are short staffed, and I will say that the only girl working in there was very kind..... but this filth is absolutely unacceptable at a childs play place.  They charge 12 dollars for one hour. Not worth it at all. I will never ever bring my son back to mega play.

This place was wonderful for our son‚Äôs 5th birthday party. Our son got to experience another kid‚Äôs birthday party held here last year and loved it so much, he asked to come back and have his birthday here this time.

Just like last time, the tables were already set up, the room was already prepared for all of the parents and the kids. Literally all we had to do was bring our son and his birthday cake (with utensils).

If I could change anything at all, I‚Äôd want:
-Help facilitating the pizza-cake-opening presents thing for parents/people who haven‚Äôt hosted a party before. Or a reference source offered at the time of the party.
-Designated birthday seat for the birthday kid at the furthest end of the table.

Review: Mega disappointment

I've been bringing my family and friends to this establishment for a while now, so it‚Äôs disappointing to see that little to no repairs or maintenance is ever done whenever we revisit.  It‚Äôs very frustrating to see all the out-of-order signs and dirty mats my children are provided to play on. This visit was the most disappointing due to my son's favorite ride being out of order once again on our latest visit. I would assume with the price of entry; it should be sufficient enough for maintenance and replacements of mats and balls for the ball pit. As a frequent customer, I am pretty upset with the lack of care and upkeep of this indoor playground.

At least spray some aresol lysol on some areas if there isnt time to wipe down. Also, there are 3 very large issues that need to be fixed on the equipment and if the managment just inspected it they would see how children could fall through or get hurt. I wont elaborate because id like them to look through all the obstacles and see what im talking about. Id be willing to change ny review if items were properly fixed.

Review: My kids have been coming to this place for 3 years and absolutely love it. Besides the occasional times my kids have gotten sick, never had many issues. I have my kids birthday parties here. My concern currently is yesterday when we went at the FIRST time slot available; my 5 year old managed to get their leg IN BETWEEN a zip tie that is holding the net to the giant Playset. Another parent had to run up there and help me break the zip tie as my child was suspended in the air.

Additionally, there was a large hole above the slide that my child thought was funny to try to stick their head through. Obviously I corrected my child. However, this is still a serious safety concern and should be checked CONSTANTLY and addressed asap. Not once a week!

I called the manager the next day who told me once a week someone comes through to check the safety of the net and the playset. She Then proceeded to tell me that the large hole in the net above the slides must‚Äôve occurred the same day because the employees check the nets every night. That is not possible, because we arrived at the very first timeslot that was available that day.

I tried to explain to her that the zip tie was also loose because there‚Äôs no possible way my child could have slipped their entire leg through a zip tie in between the foam padding on the side; She continued to say it must‚Äôve happened that day and that the employees are very busy.

My child is not a small kid. The zip tie had to have been loose. A zip tie that is loose connected to the foam siding can cause a child to slip through the side off the playset, and the only thing holding a child from falling down is that cheap net that the employees supposedly check every night? I think not.

Additionally, we have a birthday party planned there and I cannot get any refund for the party. I will lose 50% of the funds that I paid so I will continue to have my birthday party there for my child and we just have to ensure that a parent is in there with kids, because the employees do not effectively check the netting for safety. Most of the employees that work there are likely high school or early college kids who genuinely don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just a job to them. Nothing wrong with them personally I was at age once with a job that wasn‚Äôt a serious career for me so they genuinely do not care and probably do not check the netting every single night.They are NEVER been too busy the 20 times we‚Äôve been here to check for safety hazards.

My kids enjoy this place so much so we will likely still attend here and have the birthday party where I can‚Äôt get my money back but if you‚Äôre a parent you need to make sure you watch your child extreme amount on that place and be up there with them or have an older child who is capable of watching younger kids because your childs safety is at risk on that play set.  And because you sign a waiver, the facility and the employees and manager genuinely don‚Äôt appear to care.

Review: We usually love this place but we came in today and EVERY SINGLE BATHROOM is out of order, there are two GAPING holes in the bounce house that are large enough for a kid to fall through WITH NO SIGNS and almost all of the games are out of order. Todays trip was a total waste of money because we had to leave 30 minutes into our play time to go find a bathroom.

Review: They had choking hazards( half of Easter eggs) in the baby ball pit and employees watched as about 6 older kids throwing things  and pushing down babies in the baby area . They all stood there and not once tried to stop it one even walked by as these kids were chucking balls at people and the babies!!. They stood there  talking instead of doing their jobs. If you have a baby or toddler do not bring your baby here !!!!!

Review: Fun place for kids. Lots of blow up areas. There is a three story playset with slides and obstacles. They have a few party rooms for rent.  The only downside is I've started to notice more and more games that cost money/tokens. I get it... but still a bummer.

Review: The concept of this place is awesome but so poorly executed. It‚Äôs disgusting inside & needs better cleaning. This place is visually dirty. This place is also known that if you want your kid to get sick, you should come here cause it‚Äôs gonna happen.  You can read tons of reviews stating the same thing but the owner still does nothing about it. They also ironically only respond to some of the reviews, but none of the ones stating the issues with the place. If they don‚Äôt fix something soon, they‚Äôre gonna go out of business. My kids truly enjoyed this place and now we don‚Äôt go anymore cause we‚Äôre tired of getting sick & tired of the cleanliness so we wish it wasn‚Äôt run so poorly.

Review: Brought my 2.5 year old and 8 month old there and now both of them have Hand, Foot, Mouth. It took me a little to even think of where they could‚Äôve gotten it from and this is the only place we went that‚Äôs remotely a possibility. Scrolling the reviews just now I see another one from 8 months ago where her child also got HFM after going there.

I even wiped my kids hands and faces with wet ones wipes multiple times while we were there. The place isn‚Äôt clean or disinfected clearly. There were only a total of 5 other children in there while we were and it‚Äôs not like a daycare where you have no choice but to bring your kids there and they‚Äôre busy taking care of your children the whole time and may miss cleaning something. The employees could be sanitizing things during the loads of downtime they have.

Review: Absolutely horrible. 400$ for my daughters birthday to be ruined. The pizza came with about 5 minutes to spare, the place was so dirty, things kept going missing from the guests we invited to her birthday party. A random child ran in the room and dug his hands in the birthday cake. Nothing was done or said. We were so rushed the entire time, then the best part. My mother was actually kicked out for ""complaining too loudly"" to the 16 year old manager. She then proceeded to kick out my crying 11 year old daughter on her birthday. This place needs to be shut down.

Review: I always give credit where it‚Äôs deserved but I will say I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this play to anyone. For the price you pay for a Birthday Party ( $300.00 ). I have attended my granddaughter‚Äôs and a friend‚Äùs little girl‚Äôs party. And for what price is charged for an hour and a half for the service you receive is absolutely ridiculous. So if you like being rushed this is the perfect place. But if you want your children to have fun and enjoy then I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. Rude and unprofessional.

Review: This place used to be clean and fun for the kids. Today, it was dirty and run down. It was unsafe for my younger kids, as there was tiny pieces of styrofoam all over the floor in the play areas. While we were there a little girl fell under the big slides area and left bleeding from her nose and mouth. We have been here many times in the past and thrown several birthday parties here. Needless to say we will not be back.

Review: I‚Äôve brought my toddler here twice so far. I love that it gives him the opportunity to play, run out energy and socialize, but I do think the play areas could be cleaner. The foam mats are visibly dirty. There is also a play area specifically for younger children (less than 3 years old) and there‚Äôs often older children playing rough in that area. While I was there with my almost 2 year old, there were older kids jumping off of the top of the slide while my son was standing at the bottom of it and almost jumped right on him. I love that this is a cheap option to let your kids play, but I wish the rules were enforced more and there was more active supervision between staff and parents.}","North Carolina","megaplayusa.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","28540"

Review: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: Our daughter who is 1 & a half years old loves everything about Sprout, from the blue rocking horse to sliding down the slide. We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: We reached out ahead of time via email to schedule one morning our preschool homeschool co-op could come. They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!

Review: We loved our experience at sprouts today! It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.

Review: This place is way overpriced given the area. I was introduced to this place through one of my child‚Äôs field trip and decided to take my family here only to be closely and physically monitored more than half the time. I do not have any autistic kids by the way. We had a male coworker literally standing close by my kids, even when I was supervising, fixing literally every single thing along as my kids were playing. It was super awkward and uncomfortable to have strangers that close up in you and your child‚Äôs personal space making you feel like you‚Äôre unwanted company. I could not enjoy my time with my kids when I was being watched within a few yards by total strangers or knowing they‚Äôre hawking my kids down. It‚Äôs super weird and it‚Äôs safe to say we won‚Äôt be coming back.

Review: We are visiting from Chicago and I needed something to occupy my two yr old for an afternoon. We came in around 1:30 and my son loved the play space immediately. We were the only ones there so got to know Heather who was working at the time. She is so sweet to chat with was gentle and patient with my son who eventually was playing with her and not me.. The play space has pretend play areas and more physical elements like rock climbing and a full sized trampoline. There‚Äôs something for every child here.  Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones trying to find a way to expend their energy.

The place is cleaned regularly. The parents were able to order their food at the cafe. Thank you to Emily who was on the shift that day, the lady cook and all the staff. I told the parents that this is such a great place to have a party and hopefully they will all book their next party with you.

Review: So decided to try this for the first time today with a 9,4 and a 2 Yr old. Price to get in was reasonable but price of socks was a tad expensive when in a group of 3 or more but luckily we brought our own.

Price of food wasn't too bad, although the jacket potato was slightly cold, the chips were cold and wraps should come with chips which they don't. I was however impressed with the ¬£2.75 slush which seemed very popular with kids. Not so much for a dairy free child to eat apart from chips or Crisps ü§î

The trampoline bit both the 9 and 4 Yr old loved and were all sweated out within the first 20 mins ü§£ the play area bit well that's a bit of a let down tbh. The under 4s area was overrun by kids older than 4! My 2 Yr old was pushed and there were babies in there that could only sit in the ball pit as it was just way too busy to sit anywhere else because older kids were just running wild. There wasn't enough seating in either areas of the upstairs cafe or the play area which was a tad letdown for me.

Also the lovely green button you press to get out the play area needs to be higher as my 4 Yr old was somehow found outside the play area with another family. You need a better booking in system for the play area as its a safeguarding issue if kids can freely get out. It seems peak times are just a free for all especially older kids.

Having said all that all the staff were polite, welcoming and helpful. The pizzas were good too. It would be nice to see staff in play area as well as parents of older kids keeping a close eye on them and to avoid the under 4 area.

Would I return?? Yes because my kids loved it but were in no rush and that's why I've given it 3 stars. Would of gotten a 5 if more seating was provided.

Review: Avoid peak time. I was here on Friday noon. First we were met by a long queue outside. When we got inside after 15 minutes of waiting, the staff ensured that we would be able to stay an extra 10 minutes (I paid for 2 hours).It turned out that the room was overcrowded and there were no seats. I will only add that at the entrance I had to pay an extra pound as a fee for monitoring adult capacity. After half an hour of standing, we managed to sit down. Before I ordered the food, someone from the staff approached me, asking to leave the playground. When I asked why, he explained that I had a green armband and it was my time to leave. I explained that I was here only half an hour and I paid for two. It turned out that we were handed the wrong color of the bands.I didn't get an apology. He just threw me a different color of bands on the table. After less than two hours after entering, I was asked to leave the building again (the staff did not grant us the promised 10 extra minutes).I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. For that reason it's only one star- for tasty food.

Review: Not a bad place, but definitely let down by pricing and lack of parental supervision 5 kids.

The price per session definitely is an issue here, as a child just over 1 is the same as a child of 9/10, yet they can't use all the equipment due to their age. A staggered pricing structure would definitely make things better.

Another thing that lets this place down is the number of kids just being left unsupervised by parents, despite signs all over telling parents to supervise them. When you've got kids 7+ charging round the toddler area and throwing things at each other, it really doesn't feel like money well spent on a 1 year old to go in. During the quiet times it's not too bad, but when it's peak time, it'd be an idea for the owner/manager to have more staff in and actually enforce the rules

Not safe at all if you have small children.  She didnt even ask people to make sure doors were shut never mind get off her stool to close them.  Too busy daydreaming.  The cafe staff were great though too.  Really hard working.

The wildflower theme was beautifully executed‚Äîthe decor was stunning, and every little detail felt thoughtfully put together. The team did an incredible job preparing the space, making sure everything was perfect before we arrived.

The best part? They handled the main clean-up, all we had to do was take home what we brought, which allowed us to truly enjoy the day without the stress of packing up or dealing with a mess afterward. The kids had a blast, and so did the adults! If you're looking for a stress-free, beautifully set-up celebration, I highly recommend The Cub House.

The facility is clean, the parents are attentive and the kids are kind. The staff is very cognizant of safety and I love their no nonsense approach to those trying to bend the rules that keep the little ones safe. Every time we have been we have see the staff cleaning multiple times during our session. Not only is it a great place to bring the littles but they have great lattes! 10/10!

Review: Adorable place that we basically had to ourselves on a Saturday afternoon! Large space so I‚Äôm sure even when it‚Äôs busy it‚Äôs not overwhelming. My nearly 2yr old had a blast in both the larger space and the small space designed for those under 2. Good options at the cafe, including tons of snacks for everyone. Staff very nice and cleaning up throughout my visit. Changing tables with covers and wipes, and a diaper pail in unisex bathrooms. Good pricing for unlimited play! Probably grabbing a membership because it‚Äôs the closest play cafe to us and our favorite so far! Want to shout them out to support a local business, but also don‚Äôt want anyone else to find out about this secret in Clayton. üòÖ

Review: As a teacher of young children and a mother to 5-- Cubhouse  Play Cafe represents the quintessential place to visit for a momma of young children for the following reasons:  1.   It's super clean, 2. has friendly staff, 3.  great healthy snack choices and small meals for you and the kiddos and 4.  pretty good coffee (vanilla latte with oatmilk is great)  Sometimes you just want a place to sit and chat, drink coffee/tea AND be able to watch your children play in a safe and clean environment.  It's also full of things for kids to do.  They can read, slide, or pretend to be a cook in the kitchen!  There's lots to do.  They even have events. They once had a storyteller come to read a book for Earth Day.  She was so animated and the kids loved it.  The Cub House Play Cafe is a cross between an indoor playground, and a cozy coffee house. One of the best things is their very reasonable monthly membership rates.  (you can also pay as you play as well).  It's worth every single penny.  Your kids can make lasting, wonderful memories there. (You and your friends can as well!).  I HIGHLY recommend this place!!!  You'll thank yourself and your little ones will as well (maybe later in life :) ).......Your welcome.

Review: Giving 2 stars because the coffee is good and the place is kept relatively clean. My 2 toddlers and I have been members at The Cub House Play Cafe for almost a year and im all about supporting local businesses but unfortunately we will not be coming back here. The owner is rude and lacks basic customer service and social skills. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just my family (we‚Äôre ethnic) but my friends that go there also said that the owner is not friendly and does not greet them or say hello. She scolded my friend for having her 3 year old in the 24 months or younger section, he was playing gently with his baby sister and there were no other babies in that play area. We go to many other indoor play spaces in the triangle and the owners/staff are very welcoming. Maybe the owner can take an interpersonal course to strengthen her business etiquette. FYI most of the bakery items at the cafe are from Walmart and resold at an overpriced rate.

Review: We love going to the cub house! It is the perfect indoor spot for my littles and myself! Coffee for me & snacks for my boys is a huge plus. The toys/ play area is always clean & the employees are constantly trying to keep it somewhat organized. They have fun events you can sign up and attend as well. I love the fact that you can reserve a time and they set a limit on how many families can be there. It keeps it from being overcrowded, which I appreciate!
My 3 year old boy loves it. My 4 year old (almost 5) does seem to get a little bored after a while but I think it‚Äôs his age.
We love the cub house and always enjoy our time there!

A dress up station, pretend play kitchen station, a tree filled books, balls, bikes, trucks, and more. There was an infant play and toddler play area. My toddler played with everything and did not want to go. The birthday room was separate for the party and then all the kids enjoyed the open play. I definitely recommend this place for littles.

Review: Compared to other play cafes in the triangle its ok. What brings the score down so heavily is the terrible hours. Bumble brews play cafe and little doodles have days they are open until 5 or 6pm. This place closes at 2. Im assuming as a convenience for the owner? So if your a working parent who doesnt work remote this wont work well for you. Also we have a membership. The main benefit is discounted play. Because this is tne only place like this in the area it fills up fast.which is wonderful for the owner im sure.So if you have no reservation and you come after 9. Your screwed. They also have no limit on playtime. Which sounds great until your waiting for people to leave just to get in. If theres no limits and people stay for 4 hours thats over half the time they are open. Moral is, its cute the drinks are yummy and kids love it. But if you have no reservation it extremely hard to get in once its abit after opening. I hope they become more convenient to families by staying open as late as the other places in the triangle do and my enforcing a time limit so that more people can enjoy the beautiful play place they have. 2/5

It's great for playdates and also has space for parties/events.

** Heads up due to capacity limitations they do suggest making a reservation for play. But walk-ins are welcomed.

$12 per adult. Kiddos are FREE!
Drinks priced between $3.95 and up depending on what you get.

Review: As a stay at home mom to a 10 month old, it is difficult for me to find activities and places to go that are safe and appropriate for her age, when I stumbled upon The Cubhouse Play Cafe I was sooo excited to check it out!
I visited today with my husband and our daughter and I was blown away with how nice and spacious it was, as well as how kind and welcoming the owner is!
The play areas are very clean and organized and there was a staff member in the play area actively sanitizing, organizing and even interacting with the kids. I loved how friendly, safe and comfortable it felt. Also, the murals and artwork throughout are absolutely beautiful & add such a nice touch to the entire space. My husband and I both really enjoyed the snacks and beverages that they offer as well! I am so excited to make this a regular activity for my daughter & I and would recommend it to anyone that has kiddos and needs a safe space for them to play and explore!

Review: A great play space for young children! It is a really large venue with areas for the cafe, seating for parents, main play space for kids, a separate baby/infant space, and a party room.

The main play space has climbing toys, bouncing toys, building toys, a giant book nook, and many centers for creative and imaginative play. Almost everything is Montessori style which is really nice taking a break from all the noisy flashing toys out there.

The cafe is really nice, a good selection of coffee and tea but also a fridge stocked with other drinks. There are many different treats and snacks to choose from good for adults and kiddos.

It looks like a really fun venue for parties and will definitely be keeping this on my radar for the future.

I think the price is reasonable for what you get, but I do think the membership or punch card is totally worth it. We spent 2 hours there on our first visit and would have stayed longer if we didn't have to go get lunch.

Overall I highly recommend this place for parents with young kids - probably best for kids 5/6 and younger.

Review: Could not recommend this place enough! We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i‚Äôm assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it‚Äôs too hot outside.

My only suggestion which isn‚Äôt even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included!

Review: My friends daughter had a birthday  Sunday March 24th today. Someone at the door said this was the little girls birthday and it was time for the party so the money we had spent on a present was stolen from the birthday party before. If I was the owner I would roll back the cameras and have them banned from ever coming back. You don't do that to people. People work really hard for what they have. Something needs to be done as soon as possible. (My friends daughters birthday was IVYS )

Review: DO NOT GO HERE!!! My friends girl and my girl were being scared by a little boy, we told them to ask him to stop. He didn‚Äôt listen so my friend and I asked him to stop and he still didn‚Äôt stop and then he started pushing and corning them with his arms on either side of them so they couldn‚Äôt get away! We told him that was not ok and then confronted his parents. He still pursued them and so we told his parents again. Now, non of this so far is the business fault but then the owner steps in while we were talking with his parents and says we should‚Äôve come to her and not ‚Äú yelled at her customers, that this little boy comes all the time and is just fine.‚Äù My friend says‚Äù but he is pushing our girls‚Äù and the owner just argues back and it it obvious that she is upset and that this little boy is being backed up and will not stop. so we start to leave and the owner follows us out the door, still yelling, telling us not to come back. This is not the kind of place you want to bring your kids, if this is just one instance of how the owner of the business acts! That is not ok!

Review: NASTY MANAGEMENT! Cruel EXCLUSION AGAINST ALLERGY kids. The way in which management speaks to allergy kids‚Äô parents is inhumane and rude. Without mercy, the manager, Susan, disregards the safety of allergy kids. She doesn‚Äôt care about excluding kids at parties. Allergy kids need to exit the building to eat homemade food on the street or in the car with their parent. Alternatively, they can stay inside and watch their friends eat, while they sit there hungry with no food. Management doesn‚Äôt care about a parent‚Äôs concern. The answer will always be, ‚Äúno exceptions, we‚Äôre a business! It‚Äôs a business rule.‚Äù I have never had a manager (stranger) be so cruel and abrupt that I burst into tears at defeat. I just wanted my child to be able to stay and eat with her friends at the party.

My kids love the place. Removing a star for unpredictable hours - even though the sign on doors/Google hours say one thing, often they close for private party or just close earlier unannounced. I recommend calling before driving over there.

Review: My husband and I brought our 16-month-old son for his third experience at an indoor playground and this was by far our favourite. The toddler section was the perfect set-up for him to move around and increase his mobility as he is just getting comfortable with walking and moving around. He also loved to ride in one of the cars on the track and going down the toddler slide. As were leaving, the manager on shift came to see how we enjoyed it and recommended Toddler Tuesdays. We will absolutely be bringing him for that and bringing him back on Public Play Days

The play area is alot of fun for kids of all ages, they have a small climbing area for kids under 3. Giant fenced area with soft balls to play with. The main floor has small cars for kids to ride.  Claw games where every time is a winner so you kids can enjoy a nice little reward.
If interested there is food as well, pizza and other items.

My daughter is almost 3 and she had a blast and so did her dad and I winning her some prizes.

100% worth it!

Review: I visited today, March 11th with my niece. Our last visit seemed okay, so we returned. She loved the bounce area. It is clean and has well-defined areas.

I wouldn‚Äôt say the rules posted everywhere are monitored. I saw several kids get hurt by others climbing up slides and pushing down on the equipment. I get that parents and guardians are supposed to keep an eye on their child, but the fact is, that doesn‚Äôt always happen. They could use someone to walk the facility and remind the children of rules.
Also, everything seemed a ‚Äúmoney-grab‚Äù. For example, I bought a water bottle for my niece and knew she wouldn‚Äôt drink it all, so I asked for a cup to share it between us, I was told it would cost an extra dollar. I ended up just buying a second water bottle that she took 2 sips from. I agree with another poster that the arcade games are unnecessary. They‚Äôre just another way to entice parents to spend more money.

The food was alright and fairly priced, but I intended to go home to eat between play times. After spending $20 ($16.99 + tax) for our entry fee, I thought it was with in/out privileges, but I was told if we go home to eat, we cannot return without paying again. When she said they didn‚Äôt have a way to track if I‚Äôd paid, I thought that‚Äôs untrue, as they ensure everyone in the facility signs a waiver. Or give me my receipt and I‚Äôll prove I‚Äôve paid when I return. Similar places in the area offer this and I‚Äôll go there instead.

Overall, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back. Other patrons there were saying similar to me. It got very crowded and you could barely move sometimes. The staff were food police, coming up to parents and accusing them of bringing outside food.

They allowed to bring own water bottles in which is a bonus.   The kids had a blast playing on the equipment.   We chose not to do arcade games but nice touch that they are there.   Staff were very friendly, my granddaughter fell out front prior to going in and they let us in early to clean her up.   Definitely will return.

Review: I go here reluctantly, out of desperation for options in the cold/rain/extreme heat. Looking at the square footage, atleast a third of it is arcade toys.

This place is just such a money grab, at every turn, unnecessarily.

The slices of pizza are so small and prices inflated in a way that is so ridiculous I hate going here. No outside food allowed and when I went with my 6 month old and gave him and my toddler blueberries (in the shoe/coat area, not even in the gym itself)we got scolded/practically yelled at‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not like they have healthy options for food for a 6 month old and it was just blueberries. On that day it was 35+ degrees outside in the sun and we were told to go eat on the sidewalk or in the car.

I always hear parents arguing with their kids that they don‚Äôt want to spend more money on the arcade toys/prizes etc. The Playcard eats at least half my money on my card every single time I‚Äôm there and it‚Äôs hard to avoid the games because they are everywhere.

The toys are actually pretty dirty, I have to bring alcohol spray with me and every time I wipe anything, filth comes on the wipe so I just keep my kids away from as many of the really dirty ones as possible.

If any other indoor playground opens, I will drop this place in a  heartbeat.

Review: Amazing place to take kids of all ages and keep them entertained for hours! The management and staff are extremely friendly and I like how they will walk around often to make sure everything is going okay. They ensure that everything is clean, people are following the rules and playing safely. As a nanny, I highly recommend this indoor playground!

Review: Do not buy the game play card here. It‚Äôs a scam.

I bought the $80 game play card in this location about 1 year ago, but never used it. When I bought it, the manager said it won‚Äôt expire. However, when I tried to use it recently, the card is not working anymore and the manager said it‚Äôs not their card. (Very very rude attitude !!) I called the card company and they said there are issues with the machine in this location and it‚Äôs not their responsibility. Pls don‚Äôt waste your money in the machine here!

Review: I‚Äôm writing to express my deep frustration with the poor customer service I experienced at your playground.

I brought my 6-year-old son to play while also having my 5-month-old baby in a stroller. When I arrived, the cashier was on the phone and didn‚Äôt bother to wait until she finished to check us in. Instead, she rudely rushed through the process, only telling me the fee and asking for the ages of my children.

To my shock, she then told me that strollers weren't allowed! What did she expect me to do‚Äîhold my baby for the entire time? When I mentioned I had to take the stroller inside, she suggested that I take out the car seat and put it on the table. I asked if she would be responsible if my daughter fell off the table, and she had the audacity to rudely tell me to ‚Äúcalm down.‚Äù

This is honestly the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I will not return and will be sure to share my experience with all my friends. It‚Äôs disappointing to see such a lack of concern for customers.

Review: I would recommend considering alternative venues for your event. My experience with this establishment was disappointing, primarily due to the owner, Lisette, and her approach to customer service. I regret not reading   earlier negative reviews regarding her lack of professionalism and prioritization of profit over client satisfaction.

During our event, I felt that many costs were unnecessarily inflated, which was particularly disheartening given the substantial amount we invested‚Äîaround $800. This is a significant expense, and it would have been more enjoyable to spend that money on a nice dining experience. Additionally, Susan, Lisette's daughter, encouraged us to order more food than we needed, most of which went to waste.

A particularly frustrating incident occurred when one of our guests was refused entry at the door, even though we had not yet reached the minimum capacity for our event. It was surprising to witness such a lack of flexibility. Our guest left the event upset .  I also noticed that a young family member, a 13-year-old, was allowed to work in the establishment, which I found unprofessional.

Furthermore, the policy of not permitting outside snacks, while allowing drinks, seemed contradictory and not very customer-friendly. This restriction, which they claimed was for safety, appeared to be more about limiting customer choices. For those seeking healthier food options, the absence of such considerations was disappointing.

I also felt pressured to purchase specific items such as cakes and decorations, which contributed to the overall sense of being taken advantage of as a customer. While Susan expressed a desire to apologize during the event, the timing felt inappropriate and did not mitigate the overall negative experience.

The  balloons we purchased  from them were not adequately inflated, leading to them not lasting the duration of our event.

I believe in treating customers with respect and care, and I would encourage Lisette to adopt a more client-centric approach that values customer relationships over profit. I would strongly recommend exploring other venues where the owners prioritize treating their guests with kindness and respect instead of taking advantage of them .

Review: We have enjoyed coming here for years now but todays experience or should I say lack there of left a sour taste in my mouth. We decided today to go to kids cuckoos nest to get out and do something fun but avoid the outdoors on a super hot day due to me being 5 and a half months pregnant. We know from previous visits that weekends are normally busy so we figured later in the afternoon would be the best time. We arrived at 3:40 and upon entering we were met with the manager who informed us they closed at 4... The summer hours. When I stated that online it says 7, she became defensive. I pulled up googles page and showed her and she stated well its on our website. We left disappointed... After getting back into our car something told me to check their website and what does it say right there on their main page OPEN TILL 7 on Saturdays. I looked all over their facebook and website and never saw where it CLEARLY stated their summer hours.
I highly recommend calling in advance to check their hours before driving out of your way to go like we did.

I also thoroughly enjoy my iced latte from the bar and the menu selection provided to the adults. I especially like the ample amount of seating space for the adult to watch and/or relax while our little people played.

Review: Although I am not the one to normally write a review, I feel compelled to share how disappointed I am with this business. From the top down, it seems clear that profits and self-interest are prioritized above any sense of responsibility, consistency, or customer care. The owner has repeatedly failed to open the business on time and rarely communicates when this happens ‚Äî leaving families confused, frustrated, and sitting outside the door with their baby/toddler in frustration. Despite having paid for services that were supposed to be reliably available during stated business hours, there has been no consistency with their hours of operation.
When events are cancelled there is no clear communication.

The lack of consistency is staggering. When families pay for a service ‚Äî especially one that‚Äôs supposed to offer a dependable, supportive environment ‚Äî the bare minimum expectation is that the service will actually be provided. Unfortunately, that just hasn‚Äôt been the case here.

Save your time, money, and energy. More importantly, if you value your family or even the concept of value itself, look elsewhere. You deserve better.

Review: We were looking for a new activity for our 2 year old to start after taking a break from tumbling. Looking through the local area we came across The Baby Bar! We have brought our daughter here at least a dozen times now and she LOVES it. She really enjoys all the different toys, especially the bounce house, trampoline and swings. Everyone we have met is so friendly, accommodating and helpful. A specific shoutout to all the hosts who have gone above and beyond to welcome our family and immediately made us feel so at ease in a new environment. The Baby Boutique is an amazing resource for affordable clothing and items, the events are fun for the kids, and honestly I have just had a wonderful experience here.

(As a note, going to a play place s also just a great opportunity to see the toys and activities your child naturally gravitates towards while thinking of gifts. I have been able to choose what to get my daughter for her birthday and she gets to play, a win win for us both.)

Review: I was super excited to have my son‚Äôs first birthday party here and it turned out, not to be what I expected. I arrived at 12:50pm to get the room set up/oversee the progress (mind you the reservation was between 1p-3pm); to my surprise the room was set up for a Mrs Rachel party that took place at 3pm. They didn‚Äôt have my son‚Äôs decor ready nor was the room ready by 1pm. I left the facility at 1:15pm to go pick up the birthday boy. All of our family members were arriving and could‚Äôve signed the play waivers for their babies but the employees waited until our arrival around 1:40pm to get the guests to sign waivers while making sure I understood I only had 20 minutes left in the party room. There was no reason why the guests couldn‚Äôt have played while we weren‚Äôt there. I provided their names to the staff previously and paid for their admission in advance. There was no reason why the guests couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed the experience. Later on while the children were enjoying their food, I was informed that the staff and owner went into the party room to clean it for the next reservation; the Mrs Rachel Party they had set up preciously.. There was no conversation to the children in the room to let them know ‚Äúhey we are about to clean this room‚Äù they just started spraying their chemicals around their food and our sons birthday cake. As time went on, we (mommy and daddy) were enjoying this time with our family enjoying our sons birthday, when it was brought to my attention that one of the employees referred to my sons father as ‚Äúare you the baby daddy‚Äù. Excuse me. There was no decorum nor respect in the place. We felt rushed, overlooked, bamboozled, and lied to. They sold us on a fantasy and it was proven to be a lemon.

The sign in process is simple, for anyone who has a bit of common sense & experience with literally any other waiver process. Scan the QR code, fill out the form online, made my payment and that was that.

The sheet amount of stuff to DO (play with, climb on, swing on, pretend play accessories, stacking or sticking together, read, wear) was surprising!! For a space this size, it is fully maximized! Not to mention the literal baby bar, little high chairs lined up at a bar with a TV playing all toddler friendly stuff while they can have Italian ice, juice, or snacks.

This place was literally perfection. I did notice a couple who was informed to stay out of the bar area, as it was for employee use only, directly disobey the minute the staff member left the area and began snooping through the contents kept hidden and out of reach behind the bar. So I would recommend the owner install cameras so she can protect herself against people with ill-intent. :)

Review: This place is just the coolest. I brought my wild grandsons here and they had more than enough to keep them busy and entertained. It was a fight getting them to leave! I had to promise that we would come back very soon. They loved the wooden climbing toys, the swings, and all the play pretend activities available. I only noticed one staff member, but she was a true delight. She mentioned that she had just started working there recently, but she was doing a great job playing doorman, hostess, ‚Äúbartender‚Äù, and janitorial roles. We will be returning, as well as recommending to friends & family.

Review: Took my son here and we had a great time. So many different age appropriate toys for him to play with and explore on. There was only one woman holding down the fort, she was checking folks in & slinging drinks from behind the bar, all while wiping down surfaces as she went. I was impressed with her attention to detail. We will definitely come back & bring friends with us. Highly recommend.

Review: I've been to the Baby Bar a few times now and I really want to like it, but the experience is just not great for parents or kids.

Each time I've been there, it's been basically empty with staff sitting around bored, yet every surface is dingy and dirty. Floors look like they've never been vacuumed and the counters where kids are supposed to snack are sticky and unclean.  When a place as busy as the Children's Museum is spotless, it's hard to understand how The Baby Bar can be so filthy with several staff members and two guests.

The most recent time I went, there was a family there with a kid that was very clearly sick with a snotty nose and hacking cough. I was shocked that a sick kid was allowed to come in and play since one of the rules posted on the wall states ""no sick kids."" The staff didn't seem to mind at all even though I wasn't the only parent to immediately leave after noticing the kid.

I really tried to give this place a chance, but it seems worse each time I go and if I'm going to spend $16 I'd rather go to the Science Center or the Children's Museum.

Review: My daughter absolutely loved The Baby Bar! It was the perfect solution to get her energy out before nap time! Her absolute favorite part was the swings! With the weather being so off and on lately, this was a much better option than taking her to a park. She is also at that age that the park is too much for her. This was just right with all of the age appropriate toys and no big kids running around. It is also a great place to actually play WITH your kids. No distractions of making dinner, laundry or cleaning the house. Just you and your baby. Highly recommend!

Review: This morning we decided to try a new indoor playground, The Baby Bar. Entering the establishment for the first time, there is a lengthy admissions process to the facility that makes you want to just throw in the towel and the waivers come after you playü§î. The receptionist advised that there was hot coffee bar in the area and not to let the kids near it. I immediately posed my concern about hot beverages in a children‚Äôs play environment.  She said, it was for parents who wanted to enjoy that while their kids played. Once we reached the play area, we were aesthetically pleased with the age appropriate toys. After a few moments in, we noticed the ‚Äúcoffee bar‚Äù was more than what was originally described. If I‚Äôm being required to man an area so my kids don‚Äôt wonder, then I going to inspect it. I was in disbelief  when I saw open bottles of Brut, Smirnoff, beer and cleaning supplies, completely unsecured. I moved the open bottles to the counter to avoid any potential risk for any child. Moments later, my son fell due to a very unstable baby bench press toy. It was wobbly and not secured  at the joints. My youngest son and another little boy were near the personal belongings dresser, a random piece of wood fell off of it hitting the other baby in the face. The  dresser wasn‚Äôt even secured to wall to avoid a fall risk. That was it, we were out of there.

The cherry on top of our experience was when I called back and spoke with the owner. I‚Äôve never heard so many excuses in a conversation. She stated, she never had any children wander behind the bar and it‚Äôs never posed an issue. The liquor is for hosted parties and catered events for parents who are okay with parents drinking in front of kids or ones that allow their kids to drink too. Weird, right!! She mentioned she had multiple bars in Greensboro and had all her permits. All I cared about is the safety of the children, mine and others, not your bars that require a I.D to drink.

The point is, if you want to run the risk of your child getting tipsy due to lack of securing open liquor, then this the place for you. Your unpaid job as the bouncer to the open liquor will not be enjoyable. We came so our kids could enjoy free play in a fun environment and it wasn‚Äôt at all. I hope they address these very serious concerns.

Review: I really wanted to like this place and decided to try it for open play. The play area itself was nice, with a good selection of toys. However, we were concerned about the lack of childproofing throughout the space.

The shoe rack, standing about four feet tall, was not secured to the wall, posing a potential tipping hazard. The bar area was completely accessible to children, with open alcoholic beverages on the floor and cleaning solutions within reach‚Äîthings you definitely wouldn‚Äôt want kids getting into. We did sign a waiver stating that parents are responsible for keeping children out of the bar area, but given how easily accessible it was, this still felt like a safety issue. Additionally, the bathroom had exposed outlets and switches without covers, which raised further concerns.

While the concept is great, I hope they make necessary safety improvements to create a more secure environment for young children.

Note: One of the other parents there at the time picked the two open wine bottles up and set them on the counter because they were not sealed in any way.

Libraries are nice but you don't want to be too loud! This place has a place for parents to eat and drink, and kids to play. A ball pit, chairs, slides and a small bouncy house. They also sold baby items for $1 and if you donated it would go towards you playing there. Anything leftover is donated to a shelter. I'm so happy we have this space and I wish all places had a center like this!

Review: 5-Star Google Review for The Baby Bar

The Baby Bar is an incredible space for children to explore, learn, and grow. The Montessori-inspired play area is thoughtfully designed, providing endless opportunities for creativity and discovery. My son has not only enhanced his social skills here but has also built meaningful bonds with the staff and has opened up when he sees other children to play with. The music classes offered are amazing and engaging for all littles!

We were thrilled to host his first birthday party at The Baby Bar, and it was a fantastic experience! The owner and staff are always warm, welcoming, and accommodating, making sure every detail was perfect. It truly feels like a home away from home for our little one.

I highly recommend The Baby Bar to any parent looking for a nurturing and engaging environment for their child. It‚Äôs a gem in our community!

Review: This location is small but practical. An incident occurred where my child experienced a fall upon descending to the second tier of a raised surface. Despite my inquiry to the overseeing attendant regarding potential safety hazards that could result in injury, her lack of attentiveness was evident. Engaging in a conversation with another patron, the surveillance personnel displayed disinterest and neglected their duty of monitoring the children present.

Review: I've been to this place many times. Usually, the experience is okay, no issues. But last night, the guy at the front desk was so rude- he came up to us saying our baby can't be in the play area where my 3 year old son was playing because we didn't pay for her. She was just sitting there on the mat, she's too small to play with anything or go on the slides (which is why we didn't pay for her admission)

And then my son had a ball in his hand that was already in the little coin car ride, he asks for the balls and points at the sign, and says you're not supposed to take the balls out of its designated area (he seemed to have a bad attitude) My son obviously can't read, he's 3. And also he was not the one who took the balls. They were already in the little car that he was playing with. We let him know the balls were in the car before my son started playing on it and left shortly after. I just feel like the staff should be kind, especially cause they work around kids. Will not be returning to simply play kids

Last year we went during weekdays (wintertime) and the heating was kept low. The washrooms were not clean and the toys in the baby area were broken.

Today we came again, and the place was packed with people. The heating was on, but the washrooms were equally dirty. This time fewer slippers and no step stool for kids. No paper towels in the dispenser. Toys still broken. If you want to exchange money for coins, they tell you that you'll be taxed on the transaction. The whole entryway area is nasty.

I wish this place was better, but each time the experience was horrible.

She also confirmed that they would accept a tax exempt card upon booking, and they agreed. However when it came time to pay, they refused to accept the card. It is the last time we will be booking an indoor playground party, as our children have now aged out, but this last visit has negatively affected how I look at simply play and will most likely not recommend it to others.

All in all, we had a great time.
The kids we happy, the prices are fair and we'll always come back.

If management is reading this, please take my suggestion here as constructive criticism with the best intentions.
The movie room is great. You got a nice little space for it and its certainly something not all play places have. So, with that said, I believe it would be a good idea to remove the huge grey filing cabinet and other junk beside it somewhere else where no one can see it.
It's a huge eye soar in such a great room.
You know what I mean? It's not crucial, but it would look way better.

Keep up the good, safe, work.
We'll be back soon.

Review: I've never been here, however, after reading so many terrible reviews, I don't think I would want to visit here either. And interestingly enough, I have many friends with kids who live in this area and have never chosen to take their kids here and now I understand why. I like that it's close to my parents house however after reading some of the terrible reviews and the responses from the owner, I don't think I would entertain the thought of coming here. I'm afraid to even step foot into this venue as if I did leave a review that was negative, I feel that the owner would just respond saying it was my mistake in some way or another. And I've never felt that way before going somewhere...

Review: My toddler and I really love this indoor playground. Out of all the ones we‚Äôve visited this one is definitely up there. It has a great variety of activities including a dedicated toddler area. It‚Äôs very clean and well kept.
This is my local one as I live in the area however the past 2-3 times we‚Äôve visited I‚Äôve noticed an unusual smell when I‚Äôve walked in which was not there before (we‚Äôve been coming for a year now) and it‚Äôs usually lingering around even when the place is empty. My last visit the playground was very busy which made the smell very prominent so we decided to leave. I mentioned it to the staff today and she said that there was have been leaks due to rain so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing the smell. I hope the my can get it sorted because we really do love the place and can‚Äôt fault it otherwise.

Review: Was there to celebrate with my Grandson for his 2nd birthday. Very busy place. They're not too punctual with their timing of people who are already there. Making it difficult and less time for the next seating. My Grandson 2 hours time was cut into half, literally. Then we were kicked out because they had to accommodate the other group. I definitely wouldn't book anything here again. It was expensive too almost $800.00 that I was told had to be paid before we left. I DON'T know if a deposit was required to hold and book the venue. We took everything, decorations, cakes, foods, etc. We had to pay for the kids rides, etc. So I DON'T know what was the hype about. Perhaps because of the playground for limited amounts of kids.

Review: Great place for kids and parents! My boys (3 and 6) get to enjoy the indoor playset or get creative with the multiple play areas (a grocery store, a farm, a kitchen, etc). I get to work on my laptop and enjoy coffee while having them within a clear line of vision so I can step in to help if needed.

The staff is friendly and somehow keeps the playroom tidy the entire time. It‚Äôs a safe and clean place for kids to play and interact.

This is such a great idea‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure why there‚Äôs not one in every city!

Review: Smaller than expected and the equipment was not that great. We have a bigger play area at home than the one designated for babies, so it seemed like a waste of $12. The coffee was substandard, which is a real shame since there is a very good coffee shop right next door. Of course you can‚Äôt bring outside coffee in, but if they advertise themselves as a place to enjoy a coffee, it should be at least passable quality. I was also a little taken aback that there is no nursing area. I asked at the counter about a place to nurse and the employee said there was no area available. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be back unless significant improvements are made.

Review: Perfect place for my toddler‚Äôs birthday. Small and quaint. Beautifully set up with kids in mind. The kids were able to play independently. All I had to do was show up. Snack table with fruit, vegetables, stickers, goldfish, apple sauce and honest fruit drinks. Plates, cups, utensils and water provided. I did not have to worry about a cake. I picked a Bluey themed party, and it was well thought out. Parents can get a variety of coffee - which was surprisingly good. They do provide pizza. We opted out and bought our own catering from Moe‚Äôs. They were open to this. Well priced. We will go back especially for parents‚Äô night out.

Don't bother. Customer service is lousy and management isn't much better. We've made two trips to use the Groupon I bought to try it out and are 0-2. Spent 15 minutes at the counter with other guests before anyone even acknowledged us, then told us they're closed for a party.  Owner insisted this was posted on the sign, it wasn't, then said it was on their website, wasn't there either. We'll pass.

I understand they are under new ownership so hopefully they'll get things a bit more together soon.

Review: Took my 18 month old here earlier this summer. Awesome concept! A few thoughts...

-I would have probably given our experience 3 stars, but upped it to 4 stars because the most frustrating thing about our visit wasn't Palmetto Proper's fault! There was a mom there who didn't look up from her computer for over an hour. Her two kids were everywhere and climbing on all the things they weren't supposed to. It was really sad as one of them, who said he was 2, was starved for attention. He wouldn't leave us alone and ended up jumping on my daughter's head. Not sure how common it is for the parents not to be paying attention here.

-I maybe had too high of expectations based on other reviews and we may have just come at a bad time since it was right before closing, but the area/toys were a little more rundown and dirtier than I was expecting (I know it's hard with kids!). There's no place in the area that I know of that rivals this place, but it seems like there definitely could be in the future.

-Overall, I will probably not bring my child back until she is at least 3 years old due to safety/parents not paying attention. I do think that it would be worth renting out for a party though!

Review: Was hoping for a wow factor , but was just over all disappointed. We arrived for the first time to try this place out with our 3 year old.  It was ok. Placed an order for a coffee. 10 minutes later , still never received the coffee and had to remind the lady to make it for us. We were they only people there that had placed an order. The lady that was working was nice enough, but seemed most focused on her phone than customers. My husband finally received his coffee and it wasn‚Äôt even what he had ordered. We didn‚Äôt even say anything because we already had to remind her to make it ‚Ä¶ what was the point in mentioning that the order was wrong too ? We let our daughter play a little longer and then we left.  The play area itself is ok, it is small and toys are limited. But it was clean.  I wanted to love this place, sadly it just didn‚Äôt work out. Hopefully , other customers will have a better experience than we did.

Review: This place is best suited for very small kids and little girls. If you have a boy over the age of 2, I wouldn‚Äôt bring them here. There‚Äôs no room for them to run and it definitely can‚Äôt handle rambunctious kids. My son is 4 and I just felt like he was annoying all the girl and baby moms in here. These are my personal thoughts and experiences. The staff is very friendly.

Review: Gave this place 5 stars because my daughter loves playing here! Personally, the only thing I deal with is having to fight my daughter grabbing candy every time we come here. This really isn‚Äôt a critique, it‚Äôs just my own personal experience that stoped me from getting a membership to come everyday. I‚Äôm fine with buying her something healthier. The other places I don‚Äôt have to fight her because they don‚Äôt sell candy, they sell snacks. But when there is candy, she will choose candy over snacks. So it‚Äôs a fight in and out. However, she is learning that we don‚Äôt always get things we want. It‚Äôs just an awkward learning curb. But love the place and y‚Äôall are doing great.

For a simple, cost effective birthday, I highly recommend! The kids had a blast, the adults could monitor, but relax because everything is enclosed, and the party loft was everything we needed for kid snacks and cake! We will be visiting again.

Review: We just hosted my 3 year old's Super Hero birthday this past weekend. It was our first time at Palmetto Proper. It was a great experience! We literally walked in and everything was done! All the decorations (which were well above others in the area) and themed for our party, fruit trays, pizza and cake. We had Spiderman make an appearance and he was very good at engaging our young crowd. We had face painting too! This was a great experience and I loved how the party hosts were very engaged to make sure we had a wonderful experience. We can't wait to go back!

Review: We had a birthday party there recently and I do not recommend spending your money there for it. They forgot we had added pizzas onto the party ($40 for 4 pizzas) and I spent 10 minutes proving that we did add it on to the party that we paid for. They acted like they didn‚Äôt forget and gave us 4 little Caesar‚Äôs pizzas to us which would have been around $27. I did not agree for little Caesar‚Äôs pizzas and if I knew that was the case I would have picked them up myself. I had to ask the lady working what time the pizzas were coming and she didn‚Äôt know about me ordering pizzas at all so unless I reminded them they wouldn‚Äôt have brought anything. Hey called and played it off like they didn‚Äôt forget. The women working were standoffish as well. I only gave 2 stars because the kids had a great time but the way everything happened put a sour taste in my mouth.

Review: Lots of fun for 6-year-old. She‚Äôs creative and prefers to play independently, so it was great that there were only three other little ones in at the same time. She really enjoyed going around to all the activities and did not want to leave. Employee was super gracious and really cared that kiddo have a good time.

Only drawback was that most activities seemed perfect for little ones up to 4-5, but our tall one had to stoop to enjoy a lot of things, was too tall for bumper cars, etc.

On the whole, would recommend and return.

Review: It's a really cute concept because anywhere they serve caffeine at a place with parents is a good idea. However customer service is a bit lacking and the manager is unaccommodating and unapologetic. I felt like she did the bare minimum to get me to leave without a fuss. Also a good bit of the equipment is in poor condition or broken so it's disappointing they don't replace stuff. Also if you buy something make sure it's exactly what you want and if it's clothes, that it will fit perfectly, because there's only exchanges and if there's not anything else you'd like then you're out of luck. Overall I'll be heading to the children's museum or just splashing in puddles on rainy afternoons.

EDIT: my review was originally a 3 star, but after the most unprofessional response from a business owner I've received I lowered it to 1 star. I won't be using the remaining amount on the gift card that I received for returning a shirt that was able to be re sold because of the owners completely unapologetic attitude and unwillingness to make  anything right. I'm glad that she was able to make double the money off the item but one has to wonder if it's worth it when you're losing any future business.
P.S. Please at least replace the Melissa and Doug grocery store set up, if you haven't already, before a child gets hurt on the broken plastic.

Review: This is a cute concept but overall is not likely an establishment I will revisit. I give three stars for cleanliness and the variation of engagement opportunities for kiddos. For me the negatives included a lot of rules up front. Of course cleanliness and safety are of utmost importance so I understand some need for structure, but too many rules takes the fun out of the experience in my opinion.

The first rule included that the different category toys needed to be kept in their stations and then anything moved from their original place must be put back before leaving by the parent. I stay home with my children so every day I spend a significant amount of time picking up after them. When I pay to take my toddlers to a play place, the last thing I want to have to do is pick up after my kids, all while making sure they are safe and not making more of a mess in another area. Honestly, I understand why they have this rule because it could be pure chaos with a lot of the smaller toys and a packed house, but we frequent other places specifically Chippy's bounce house and we've never been asked to keep things together or put them back. I do try to be respectful and tidy as we go, but I don't want the responsibility of picking every item up that they played with. My whole opinion is that picking up and putting back should be a service provided by the staff. The second rule was no food or drink in the play area and that makes a lot of sense for children because they're messy. However, the whole concept of this place is a gift shop cafe and play place. The attendant asked me if I wanted a drink and I really didn't care for one but ordered anyways to further support the small business. Apparently I naively didn't think that the drink rule applied to adults and I brought my hot drink inside the play area and was drinking it around the perimeter. Within the first few minutes the attendant came over and told me no drinks were allowed in the play area and to please drink over the gate. It just doesn't really make sense to sell hot coffee for parents to enjoy if it can't be done while supervising children within the play area. Maybe that rule works ok for parents with older children, but mine are toddlers and need to be watched pretty closely. Being reprimanded although respectfully, coupled with having to clean up after my kids with  other children still playing in areas where mine had made messes, just left me feeling bothered.

Review: Would have been an awesome place to play if not for the staff. I‚Äôm not sure if the lady just worked there or if she is the owner but she made the experience unpleasant.  Most indoor play places do a routine pick up every hour or so‚Ä¶. This lady decided that it was better to walk around scolding  the children or yelling from behind the counter for them to keep the toys in their specific play areas.   Imagine trying to tell 3 year olds and under that they can‚Äôt take toys from this side of the room to ten feet to the other side of the room.  My kids were too small to be moving things around at the time but seeing the other kids get scolded for BEING CHILDREN AT A PLACE MADE FOR THEM TO PLAY, made it awkward and uncomfortable.  I‚Äôll be taking my money to village play from now on, they have a better space, better play equipment, and friendly staff.

Review: I need to start out by saying the facility is nice and the staff are nice as well. The 3 stars is because I do see improvement in this establishment. We travel across the state to visit these types of children play places monthly. The space is tight when crowded but not much can be done regarding that. There was little room to move up and down the walkway to find my children. It became a little unsafe with kids running in and out of the big kid area into the walkway. I loved seeing a 5 and under area. With that being said. I wish the door would lock and not allow for the littles to push open on their own. Additionally if there is a 5 and under area I would like for some monitoring to keep the larger kids out of it. I was disappointed in seeing 8yrs and older inside this area. Twice my children were hit in the face by feet due to the lack of these older children not paying attention to the smaller children. One of the bigger kids jumped onto my 1yr old flattening her and then ran off laughing. We had a 2hr play pass and I stayed for 45 mins because the general area was becoming unsafe. I understand that it was opening week and they still need to tweak their policies and procedures. We will give it another try in the future and I'm willing to change my review if that visit shows improvement.

Review: Wonderful experience with these guys for our seven year old‚Äôs birthday party. The bounce house was in excellent condition and the kids absolutely loved it. The one we rented can have water included as well. They were timely, professional and so very kind. Price was fair, communication superb, we could go on and on. Happy to have these guys in our town!

Review: Such a cute spot for so much play! You can tell the owner really poured her heart into making this an interactive play area while incorporating so many local touches from the area. This is very different from the play cafe that is downtown morehead in case anyone was wondering!
Toys and environment were clean. Lots of natural light and something for
all ages. Especially love the size of the area for the crawlers/littles. We will be back often! Great addition to town.

Only constructive criticism was for the ice chest in the grocery, those ice cubes traveled far and I found a few in the littles area. Those are a major choking hazard so I turned them into staff for sanitation to make their way back to where they belong. Just do your part as the parent (self explanatory) and you‚Äôll be fine. Everything else was fine!!

Review: This post is to report a referee who was in the manabi and red aces game today. Today there were so many infractions by the manabi team and he did not give them a yellow card. It is known that the owners of the lunch box sponsor the Manabi team but in soccer you have to be fair. Since each team is playing with their heart and with the desire to win fairly. Like the other team, the Red Aces, as I read, the shirts played with their soul since they want to reach the final for their effort. As a spectator I was very surprised that the referee named Jairo did not read many fouls from the Manabi team, I hugged players like #18 who when he made a foul (Manabi team) only laughed at the referee and that seemed like a lack of respect to me. Many, many times during the game this happened. One who lives the game since I am a fan, I always go to the field at the Ford Nations (Ramblewood Soccer Complex) to watch the teams play. I am very disappointed that the games are not fair. I hope that someone like the owner of global sports finds out about today's game and hires honest referees for future games.

I'm telling you in Spanish, please, the owner needs to invest in artificial grass, that carpet is terrible, it causes many injuries to the knees and elbows. Just as you earn in a business, it is always good to invest in your clientele.

Review: I‚Äôve been taking my 2 year old son here pretty consistently for the past few months, and he loves it. There is a good variety of interactive and stimulating toys, and new toys/play stations are rotated in and out periodically. A big point for me is that the play area is kept clean. I don‚Äôt know what their sanitation process is, but my son hasn‚Äôt gotten sick from playing here. That‚Äôs a HUGE PLUS! Shoes are to be taken off and only socks are to be worn in the play area. Food and drinks are only allowed in the lobby area, where they also have coffee/tea/alcohol and snacks for the kiddos. The staff and owner have been really friendly. This has quickly become one of my favorite places to take my son to play and burn some energy!

Review: UPDATE: Same cohort, and I visited, and he enjoyed the play area, which wasn't overrun for once.  My drink was not great. It tasted like watered-down milk with a little bit of chia flavor. Will need to figure out how to specify getting a good outcome.

I have been investigating the area for great indoor play spaces and taking my ""nanny kid"" to test run each one.

I was excited to see this one open. it appeared on the website, which leaves a lot to be desired, that this was a caf√© with a kid friendly atmosphere.

I arrived with my cohort, 2 y.o. male, only to discover they do, in fact, charge for children. Also, they have a time limit. But I viewed the play area, and it was wall to wall parents standing around chatting and littles toddling about. There was no space to run or be a 2 y.o. We had to leave.

I was not subjecting my l'il to that. We traveled across town to Cary and tried out Notasium. He thrived there, and though it had about the same amount of folks, the space itself was bigger. Still, it is suggested, ""An indoor playground should generally contain at least 150 square feet of room per child.¬†This can, however, vary depending on the age of the children...""

So, far Over The Moon has been his favorite and the time limit, though less then Bumble Brews ends up being over much because he literally spent 40 of the 80 minutes there running... full out.

I feel this place would ""bee"" excellent for anyone with pre walkers.

I plan to visit again when I have a client with a pre walker.

Review: I am not one to normally leave a review on place, but this place definitely deserves a really good one. Today my husband and I took our 10 month old here to place and burn off some energy since he loved it since the first time we went! Unfortunately though during our time he took quite of big fall off the large place set. He‚Äôs all good! Thankfully he‚Äôs a tough cookie! In the short chaos of the situation the staff was incredible. Both girls working were very kind, quick, and attentive to check up on us and offer ice if need be. But! What made the biggest difference for me was how the owner took time out of his day to personally call and check up on us which is obviously something he didn‚Äôt have to do but he did and it meant a lot to my husband and I. It shows he truly cares about his customers. We will be back hopefully sometime soon and will continue to bring our son back to play. Thank you guys again! You are all wonderful!

Review: Very fun place! My daughter is 10 months and loved our time there. Staff is very friendly. And for $10 it‚Äôs worth the time. My only concern was there are a good amount of puzzles and toys with smaller pieces that could cause issues with littles so I felt I had to be extra vigilant. My only complaint is the play house is really flimsy and cheap looking, not like a good fisher price house that‚Äôs sturdy. And the changing station in the bathroom was super small and the trash can was no where near it making changing diapers clumsy and more challenging.

Review: We are so glad to have a Bumble Brews close to home, and loved hosting our girls' birthday party here recently! They turned 2 and 4 so we had a shared party with about 30 toddlers running around. The Bumble Brews team made planning and hosting the party SO EASY and fun! Communication is straightforward, the staff is super friendly, and the facility is clean and well run. It was nice to have a safe space for the kids to play while adults were able to chat and relax (as much as you can with 30 toddlers running around). They have thoughtful add ons like table cloths and decor, and allow you to bring in whatever food you prefer for your party. We hosted a morning party so adults enjoyed coffee - and it was on pa with some of our favorite coffee shops in the area. We will definitely be regulars at Bumble Brews Raleigh!

Review: I can't say enough good things about Bumble Brews Raleigh! As soon as you step through the doors, you're greeted with vibrant colors and an atmosphere buzzing with joy and excitement. It's truly a haven for both kids and parents alike.

The concept of combining an indoor play cafe for kids with a space for parents to relax and enjoy a drink is pure genius. It's like a mini vacation for families! The kids get to run wild and play to their heart's content in the safe and engaging play areas, while the parents can unwind and socialize over a cold beer or a glass of wine.

One thing that stood out to me is how well-maintained and clean everything is. I appreciate the attention to detail in ensuring a hygienic environment for the little ones to play in.

And let's talk about the staff - they're absolutely fantastic! Friendly, attentive, and always ready to lend a hand or offer a smile. They truly make you feel like family from the moment you walk in.

We hosted our daughters‚Äô birthday party here and it was so much fun!  We invited both our friends and the kids closest friends, blasted our own music, and had the best time and dance party lol!  The owners were so fun to work with and went above and beyond to make sure the girls party went off without a hitch!

I love that there are signs everywhere reminding guests to wear socks, explaining time limits, among other things, so there really aren‚Äôt any surprises when you come to play!  The attention to detail does not go unnoticed to your community.

Overall, I highly recommend Bumble Brews Raleigh to any parent looking for a fun and unique outing with their little ones. It's a gem in the community, and I can't wait to visit again soon!

The party room is awesome, we just brought food and balloons and it was perfect! The play room is so great, it had plenty of activities to entertain all the kids ranging from infants to 4 year olds. We rented out the whole place and it was amazing. The kids were able to run around and play and burn some much needed energy. None of the kids wanted to leave when the party was over.
The best part is that the staff helps with clean up! It‚Äôs truly designed with kids and families in mind. There‚Äôs even stools and full on changing tables in both bathrooms, high chairs for the party room, low to the ground tables so the kids don‚Äôt have to climb. It was a hit with adults and kids alike. We will definitely be back for playing and will consider for birthday parties in the future!

Review: Not impressed. $10 for an hour and a half of play inside a small crowded room with dirty toys and not much to do. They have a nice jungle gym in the middle, but definitely not for kids older than three.

To add to owners comment below:

I expressed it was our first time here and NO ONE told us when I paid and order coffee that is was no shoes and socks required or I would‚Äôve paid for the socks initially with no issues. After getting my daughter settled playing, I noticed myself no one else had shoes on (several toddlers with bare feet also) so I took off my daughters and my shoes how about the same time one of the employees also came to inform us about being ‚Äú a no shoes facility‚Äù. Again, but no mention about socks being required. Then roughly 20 minutes into playing another time friend came up clean and said that sock are actually required and that we would need to leave or buy socks. at this time, more embarrassed than anything, I decided to leave. It wasn‚Äôt and I informed him not to worry about it, that he would be leaving.

My five year-old daughter told me herself several times that she didn‚Äôt like that place and it was for babies. I am glad you are able to market to higher age group, but that doesn‚Äôt change some of the toys being dirty, it being a small and overcrowded room or that all the toys that were available were most definitely for smaller children under 3. Thanks for your response but trying to blame me for your unclear rules just makes it more clear how under valued your customers are. Good luck in the future. My review is nothing but honest to hopefully save another parent from wasting their hard earned money as well.

Review: Bumble brews is our new favorite indoor place to play! The owners are super sweet and welcoming, and the drinks are awesome. If you go, make sure to get the Honey Latte. We started coming when my daughter was 10 months and still crawling and it‚Äôs still perfect for her age. They have a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù corner with age appropriate toys which is where we spend a lot of our time. They have a ‚Äútasted toy‚Äù bin to ensure that toys that are put in kids‚Äô mouths are properly cleaned and sanitized. It seems to best suit kids aged 1-4/5 but I have definitely seen kids a bit younger and a bit older enjoying themselves! If you do go- make sure you wear socks! Also, the afternoon is always a bit less crowded than the morning if you prefer a more quiet setting (see fourth picture- that was early afternoon and we were the only ones there!).

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog. Very impressed.

Review: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

Review: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed üòâ Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I‚Äôm counting on Francine‚Äôs lattes to see me through!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome üòé... And I'm definitely going back!! üéâ

Review: Recently had a birthday party here and was left a little disappointed with the price factor and what we received. Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: A true gem for families!
Maple is hands down one of the most incredible enrichment centers and indoor playgrounds I‚Äôve ever experienced. From the moment you walk in, you‚Äôre struck by how immaculately clean and thoughtfully designed the space is-it‚Äôs inviting, calm, and never chaotic.

What sets Maple apart is the passion and vision of its owner, (Aly)  a devoted homeschool mom who pours her heart into every detail. She‚Äôs created something truly special and brings in licensed teachers to lead and support her programs, which I love and admire.

The programs are constantly evolving and improving, which is something I deeply appreciate, it shows a genuine commitment to growth and excellence. The children are learning so much, and doing so in a way that feels joyful and natural.

Another standout feature: it doesn‚Äôt smell like food or stale coffee like most kid spots. Instead, Maple diffuses On Guard essential oils, making the air feel fresh and clean. They offer complementary coffee for parents, but it blends seamlessly into the atmosphere without overpowering the space.

Above all, Maple feels like a true community. The owner is incredibly present and engaged with the families, and you can feel the warmth between parents as they connect and build friendships here. It‚Äôs more than a business‚Äîit‚Äôs a beautiful labor of love. A total breath of fresh air!

There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: This play place is so adorable I‚Äôll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It‚Äôs been hours and he‚Äôs still telling me how upset he is that we left.

Review: It‚Äôs a nice playroom and I would come back to let my son play in the playroom but I would never have a birthday party here again. They rushed me through the party, didn‚Äôt give much time at all to set up and I felt as though I didn‚Äôt get enough time to actually enjoy my son‚Äôs 1st birthday. The party ended at 3:30 and we had to be out at 3:30, so having to clean up shortened the party even more. They put you on a set schedule and I felt stressed the whole time to stay on schedule. The staff kicked us out of the party room 30 min early to clean up for the next party and took my decorations down before I even got pictures :/ and they said they wouldn‚Äôt touch my decorations.

I think this would be a decent place to have a party if I wasn‚Äôt so rushed and had more time before and after to set up/clean up.

This was our 3 year olds first camp experience (attends preschool though) and she wanted to return to Wonder-lab Camp next week.  They enjoyed the mix of art, science, play, & being outside some.   Everything was very organized for parents & the staff was awesome.

Review: I absolutely love WonderLab!! I have always had an enjoyable experience there. It‚Äôs always super clean, the staff is always friendly, and the environment is warm and cozy.
But I did want to share my experience on 7/22/24. Per usual, we were having a pleasant time, but there was a man there with his grandchild who seemed to be sick. He was constantly blowing his nose every minute‚Ä¶ literally! And he was also picking his nose without tissue. He would then go about touching the surfaces and toys that the children were touching and that made me uncomfortable. I did speak with a staff member, and informed her that we would be leaving and not completing our scheduled playtime because of this. She did offer an apology and was very polite. I just wish they could have offered some type of pass to come back another day and get the 30 mins that we lost.  However, this would not discourage me from visiting WonderLab again. I have been numerous times and it has always been amazing.

*Update:
The Wonder Lab‚Äôs management team did reach out to me via email and helped correct the situation. Wonderful customer service  and a wonderful team!

Wonderlab checks all the right boxes. Plus they have free coffee!

I lost count of the number of times the parents told me, ‚Äúwhat a great space.‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhat a great party.‚Äù or ‚Äúwe love this‚Äù.

As the host, I loved that every option and price is available on the website, so no surprises. They allow outside catering, so I decide the food budget. The entire space is yours for a birthday party, so everyone is comfortable. I had the ability to use their tables, tape, existing decor, so I just had to add my unique touches.

Highly recommend for your kiddo‚Äôs birthday party!

It was a perfect environment for the kids (ages 1-3) to explore, be stimulated, and get their energy out. There were so many toys and activities to interact with, and unique items/setups you would not have at home - always a plus!

Review: Decent place to bring younger kids. Hours are kind of weird as most people don‚Äôt even get off of work and home til 6 so seeing later hours throughout the week would be great. Only issue is staff does their closing stuff while customers are still in the building and they shut off the games and machines 20+ minutes before closing. You definitely feel rushed to get out although you paid a decent price per kid for the hours they have posted. If your hours state you are open until 7 allot an extra 30+ minutes to have your staff clean after customers have left the building instead of while they are trying to enjoy the last 30 minutes with their kids. While staff is occupied getting their end of shift list done it leaves the counters unattended. I get it‚Äôs a kids place you should be cleaning things all day but cutting the machines off plus running loud machines just makes it feel like ‚Äú get out‚Äù also with punch card some staff will punch one per kid while others punch one per visit. And when asked about their monthly membership most answers from staff ‚Äú I‚Äôm not sure you would have to wait and ask our boss one day when she‚Äôs here‚Äù..

Seems like most all indoor play places have closed down these days, and the nearest ones are just expensive arcades or indoor trampoline parks‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll need to drive 45 minutes one way. üëéüèª

The staff here are friendly, polite, always working, cleaning, sanitizing, always attentive. They seem to only employ good people to work here. They also have good snacks and small simple meals on-hand (chicken tenders, hot dogs, etc), affordable toy vending machines, and high quality coffee!

It‚Äôs a good, secure place to go to relax, get out of the rain, or the heat, or the cold, and let the kids run free. Safely.

It‚Äôs like $15 for all-day admission. You can‚Äôt beat it. You can also host children‚Äôs Birthday Parties here! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Review: Kids Play and Cafe is hands-down the best place to bring my two-year-old! It‚Äôs the perfect spot for him to run off all that toddler energy in a safe and fun environment. The play area is clean, well-organized, and full of activities that keep him engaged for hours. What I love most is how it helps him build his social skills‚Äîhe‚Äôs constantly interacting with other little ones, learning to share, take turns, and make new friends. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the cafe is a great bonus for parents to relax while still keeping an eye on the kiddos. We‚Äôre always excited to come back. Highly recommend for anyone with young children!

Review: I took my 20-month granddaughter here today.  This is by far the best toddler indoor play area that we have experienced in the Greenville area.  It is very clean and the play equipment is safe and age-appropriate.  The prices are reasonable and you can leave and return the same day for the one price.  We stayed 4 hours.  I highly recommend.

Snacks will break you! My granddaughter had fun however she always has fun and sees the positive side of things..  it took me 45 minutes to get here.. so with no disrespect I will probably not be back.. there is another place closer to home that's cheaper all the way around.. it's a nice place please don't get me wrong.. Go see for yourself like we did.. Decor is very nice for an adult to drink the coffee.. but.. Humm

Review: Very kid friendly place, its all about kids big or little. I would definitely say its not recommended for kids 13+ in my opinion as its mostly little kids and just a park big enough to keep kids under 13 occupied for a good bit. They also have a smaller playground for kids 3 and under which is really nice for anyone bring kids that are really small and big. There are 2 separate ball pits, a little car go round and a few role-playing houses for kids to play with each other. They have a caf√© dedicated to small kids but still good enough for adults to put something small in their stomachs. There is a breastfeeding area in case women want privacy and 2 separate areas for parents to relax while kids play. There are a few machines to win prizes and some from what I can tell are guaranteed wins. There are 2 separate rooms for parties and they seem to have a lot of events going on to keep the fun going and different (like a ms Rachel meet and egg hunt). I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Yea its a little messy from kids playing throughout the day but that's to be expected... they're kids. It gets cleaned up nonetheless.

Review: We recently hosted a birthday party at Kids Caf√© in Easley, and we couldn't be happier with the experience! This place is truly a gem, especially for families with neurodivergent kids. One of our favorite things about it is how autism-friendly it is‚Äîthey even provide headphones for kids who need sound support, which was such a thoughtful touch.

The owner was absolutely amazing, communicating with us every step of the way. Even on the day of the party, she was there to ensure everything ran smoothly and that we had everything we needed. Her dedication and hard work were truly impressive!

The space was perfect for a fun, stress-free celebration, and we highly recommend it to any family looking for a welcoming and accommodating place for their child‚Äôs special day. We will definitely be back!

Bryli and Kate got us in quickly, made delicious coffees, kept the sanitizer and push broom moving. Grandma tip: buy the Kid Caf√© gripper socks, and put them over your own socks. When it‚Äôs time to go, take off the Kid Caf√© socks, and send the kids home with their own clean socks. Wash the cute Caf√© socks for next time!

Review: This place is great for the kids to run and play however I do think their small caf√© is a bit pricey considering the items and what I could get elsewhere. Also i do think somone at the desk should watch the gates because a few small kids almost went out due to the gate being left open until a parent or another bystanding parent stopped them.  But with that being said my kids had a great time and we will be back just probably not for the Caf√©.

Review: Nestled in the heart of the charming city of Easley, there's a hidden gem that has quickly become a second home for my family, the original Kids Play and Caf√©.
As a stay-at-home mom new to Easley, I was on the lookout for a place where my two toddlers could play and socialize. After some searching, I stumbled upon this family-owned treasure, and it has been a game-changer for us.

Kids Play and Caf√© isn't just a play area; it's a warm, welcoming community. The staff are incredibly friendly and always go the extra mile to make you feel at home. And those Lotus energy drinks? They're simply unbeatable. The caf√© itself offers an exceptional experience every time, with a menu full of delicious options, including vegan and non-dairy choices.

The events they host each month are another highlight, adding even more excitement to our visits. If my toddlers had their way, they‚Äôd move in!

Review: This morning, my husband and I found ourselves staring at our two kids, feeling completely stumped on what to do with them. We live in Five Forks and have already checked off the Children's Museum and the Zoo. With the heat making the park a no-go and the age gap between our kids (6 and 2) complicating things, we needed a solution. In a moment of desperation, I googled ‚ÄúThings to do with kids in Greenville, SC‚Äù and stumbled upon Kids Play & Cafe in Easley, about 45 minutes away. The photos looked promising, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would hold their interest for more than five minutes. Still, I decided to give it a try.

Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs fantastic!

From the moment we walked in, I was impressed. We signed the waiver, paid the $30, and my kids eagerly ran off to explore. The space has plenty of spots to stash shoes and comfortable seating for parents to keep an eye on their little ones. The climbing jungle gym was a huge hit‚Äîit was designed perfectly for both my 2-year-old and 6-year-old, with various levels of difficulty. I was relieved to see that there were enough ways for kids to climb up and down without needing any help from the staff. Plus, there are several other areas specifically for toddlers to play safely.

I made sure the kids had a good lunch before we arrived, but the on-site cafe had a great selection of snacks, including organic Annie‚Äôs, candy, muffins, cupcakes, and drinks like bottled water, organic juices, and coffee. We enjoyed a cupcake, some Annie‚Äôs cheddar crackers, and a coffee while we were there.

The staff were exceptional‚Äîfriendly, attentive, and proactive. When my 2-year-old removed his socks, they quickly informed me he needed to get them back on or he'd have to miss out on climbing. Honestly, I appreciated the attention they were paying. Additionally, I noticed staff members constantly cleaning and tidying up, which gave me peace of mind about the cleanliness of the facility. After visiting other indoor play centers, I can confidently say this place surpasses them all.

An added bonus was the warm atmosphere created by other parents. Everyone seemed genuinely nice, and the kids quickly made friends. One child even helped my 2-year-old into the ball pit. It‚Äôs clear that this place fosters a great community.

If I had one suggestion, it would be to make the arcade games and cotton candy machine card-friendly. I would have easily bled $30-40 into those machines, but I rarely carry cash and didn‚Äôt notice an ATM on-site. A token system or card payments could be a great addition, but I understand the challenges with credit card fees for small businesses.

As for keeping an eye on your kids, you‚Äôll see a range of options. Some parents worked on laptops in centrally located tables, others relaxed on phones in cozy egg-shaped chairs or enjoyed massage chairs, while some simply found comfy spots to sit along the perimeter. I was more active since my youngest is a bit of a daredevil, but overall, it was a relaxing experience that properly exhausted my kids and provided a nice, quiet drive home.

I hope this review helps other parents considering the drive to Easley for a fun and engaging spot for their kids.

Review: Could not recommend this place enough! We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i‚Äôm assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it‚Äôs too hot outside.

Review: We absolutely love this playground! Our kids loved it even more! (2 1/2 years old and 14 months old) They had a blast and did not want to leave! I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn‚Äôt even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend! We want to get a membership there now!

Review: We wanted to like this place but it is just not worth the time or money. It‚Äôs just overall underwhelming.
$15 per time slot and an additional $5 for each adult.
A cafe? It is not. There is a Keurig (that didn‚Äôt work) and a kettle. The snacks are all prepackaged and probably what you have in your diaper bag.
The seating is minimal and EXTREMELY cramped. The entire place is furnished from IKEA at best.
The infant area is microscopic and can really only fit one child and one parent.
The toys are worn out, stained and just not quality to say the very least.
The carpeted steps leading upstairs are stained and dirty‚Ä¶
Maybe we are spoiled by similar concepts but this place is just not it.

Review: I am a nanny and this playhouse is by far my absolute favorite place to take my nanny kiddos. The environment is amazing for littles. Some places can be too crowded and overwhelming for my kiddos and this place is a little smaller and has two separate play rooms that make it nicer and more fun. They also change up the playroom themes to keep it exciting. They have lots of fun character parties you can sign up for. We have done Elsa, Ana and Rapunzel which were a blast. 100% recommend brining your kiddos here!!

Review: The CUTEST place! Such a better deal than any other play place we go to with two hours of playtime compared to the usual one hour at the same rate or less! My little girls have to be dragged out after two hours and my big kids wish they were still small to play as well ü•∞ Great environment and I appreciate the smaller capacity so it doesn‚Äôt feel completely overstimulating like some places. Also, I love that they have both a well done play structure for gross motor, but they also have several playrooms like a fully stocked kitchen and dress up room for more quiet, imaginative or fine motor. The layout is such that I can actually sit down and watch them play which isn‚Äôt true for any other place we go. I brought a group of four other moms a few weeks ago and every single one of them raved about it. Also great that it‚Äôs for kids six and under so the little ones aren‚Äôt getting run over. My big kids played with the stash of board games while the littles played. Total win for everyone! They have a ton of themed events too like meet Bluey, princess parties, camps and birthday parties are another affordable and generous offering. Have fun there!

Review: I took my daughter to the Bluey play date today and she had an absolute blast! My favorite moment was when my daughter started twirling around in her dress and Bluey started twirling around next to her. I love how Playhouse is only for kids 6 and under, and that there is only a a small amount of kids (I think around 15) allowed to play for those two hour time slots. Definitely makes it feel less overwhelming. I also love that if you book a birthday party, only your kid‚Äôs friends will be there, and not a ton of other kids too. We will definitely be back!

She was kind, friendly, and willing to help in any capacity. Parents FYI having Play House set up and decorate for the party is worth it 10x over. I actually got to enjoy my son‚Äôs birthday, instead of being a ball of stress, and those moments are priceless. We also frequent Play House during summer/winter breaks to break up the monotony of our days.

Ps. My vote is to replace the baby area with a rock wall!

They were so helpful, it was such a nice setting for having 15 toddlers because of the enclosed space and lots of different areas to play in. The play structure alone was more than enough, but then there was the cute dress up area, the upstairs area and even the baby area was entertaining for them. Truly a great experience!! Highly recommend them for a party for a kid at or around 3-5 yr old!!

Note, I brought my own food/decorations, but can 100% see the benefit of doing the next tier up party option and make it totally easy. Plenty of room for adults and kids!

Review: I booked a 2 hour long reservation(11-1)  for my son and my niece to have a cousin play date. It is reasonably priced and the kids were very entertained. I do not believe that the toys are sanitized daily after closing or before opening. We were also rushed out by the front desk woman. At around 12 she walked up to me and stated she smelled number 2 and asked if one of my littles needed a diaper change. Being that I was not even a foot away from either I knew they didn‚Äôt need a diaper change because I would‚Äôve smelled it being I am a lot closer to them than she was. I let my littles play for 15 minutes longer and she began taking out the trash and starting her closing duties. At 12:15  I packed us up so we could grab  lunch locally before their  nap time and she immediately locked the door behind us. I‚Äôm sure she tried to suggest a diaper change to get us to leave quicker so she could get off earlier.

We‚Äôve been here a number of times for play sessions and knew it would be a perfect party spot as well. It‚Äôs especially great for older toddlers and preschoolers who want to practice their independence, because the entire play structure is visible to onlooking adults and it‚Äôs bright inside the building. We‚Äôve been to parties at much larger play places and it can be a little nerve wracking if you have very small kids. We had 12 little ones (about 30 people total) at the party and it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming. I really appreciate that parties are a private session for your group! The upstairs is also adorable, and they‚Äôve added some new sensory toys along with dress up outfits and a reading nook. We are so happy that Play House is now open - the concept is just what we needed an as option for young kids in this area. Kind owners and staff, clean environment, complimentary coffee for adults, safe space for littles to play. I‚Äôve been recommending it to everyone!

Review: The small setting was a win for us because the kids don't get lost in a crowd, and you can sit while keeping an eye on them. Very friendly staff and we always love to support a small business! We loved that they placed soft music in the background while the kids play. It's smaller than I expected, but it's a very cozy, cute place. Our 3 and 6 year olds had a great time!

First time it was great this time there were 2 boys I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the owners sons but they‚Äôre in the pictures posted from from play house and they were extremely rude to my daughter and the other kids. Everything was fine until they arrived and were knocking kids down running into them and not being considerate of the other children playing. We had to leave early because they older boy kept trampling my daughter.

Review: I took my two kids under 2 had such a wonderful experience! The play area is designed in such a way that I can allow my older one to play independently in the play structure while siting with my infant. I can still keep an eye on her because even though it‚Äôs three stories tall but only 2 rows deep. So it‚Äôs very easy to view your children while they play while also having plenty of play area. They also cap the number of kids allowed per play session which I love because I don‚Äôt have to worry about it being too crowded for my kids when I come :) I definitely would recommend this indoor playground over others in the area especially for moms of younger children.

Review: A great little spot to take your little ones!  They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

Review: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Saturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.

Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: Lovely place for kids! We had our grandsons 3rd birthday party here and the kids all enjoyed playing and had enough room to move about . The owner is a sweet lady and her staff was more thank helpful for anything we needed. Some of the adults purchased coffee drinks that are available and said they were delish! Check out this place for your kids events, but also a weekday outing for your younger children!

Review: Jungle Jamz Play Cafe is an absolute gem in Suffolk, VA! As a parent, I‚Äôm always looking for a safe, clean, and fun place for my kids to play, and Jungle Jamz exceeds all expectations. The play area is thoughtfully designed with engaging activities for kids of all ages, from toddlers to young children. My kids especially loved the interactive play structures and imaginative spaces‚Äîit kept them entertained for hours!

The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything stays spotless and well-maintained. I also appreciated the cozy caf√© section, where I could relax with a cup of coffee while keeping an eye on my little ones. Their coffee and snack options are top-notch and reasonably priced.

Whether you're planning a playdate, birthday party, or just need a break, Jungle Jamz Play Cafe is the perfect spot. It‚Äôs a must-visit for families in Suffolk, VA, and surrounding areas. Highly recommend it for a day of fun, laughter, and memories!

Thank you, Jungle Jamz, for creating such a wonderful space for kids and parents alike. We'll definitely be back soon!

The coffee is the best in town, their prices are super affordable, and everyone who works there is so nice and engaging. We ended up having my daughter's birthday party here and purchased the package where we just have to show up and play, Jungle took care of the rest, decorations and all! It was so nice to be able to spend the day with my daughter and family instead of stressing about the party.

Pros for parents- the yummy drinks, the soft couches you can lounge on, the AC!!! Meeting and chatting with other moms. The clean and safe environment your kids can play with!
Pros for kids- the fun toys, getting energy out on all sorts of equipment and toys, friends, craft time, reading time and so many fun experiences like meeting Bluey, scavenger hunts and meeting fire fighters, learning sign languages etc! There‚Äôs also a baby play area and yummy snacks! Also there is NO CONS except the distance from me but it‚Äôs worth it 100%

The membership is so worth it if you live close by, we‚Äôre here several times a week. They have fun events like a firefighter themed day where a fire truck and firemen came to give a presentation and let the kids get pictures, as well as scavenger hunts, crafts, sensory play, and so so much more.

Definitely worth checking out, even just for the delicious coffee üòãüòã

Review: We went to the Bluey Dance Party. It was super chill and low pressure on the little ones. Core memory for us parents made as my nearly 2 year old gave Bluey a fist bump.
Bluey came out for a dance, then each child got their own individual photo opportunity. Bluey then came into the play area one more time before she had to go.

They have a really good selection of toys and play equipment for a variety of ages. All the toys are also well maintained. The staff are also very friendly.

When we went all the parents were kind and understanding as well. (Which also seems to be a core philosophy here too.)

We made a 55 minute drive (due to traffic) and will be coming again!

There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Saturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.

Review: My son (3.5) has a blast here!   They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: We are so grateful for this place! Happened upon it on a rainy day and it's perfect for my 1 year old!  Thanks to the Floridan family for making sanford your home! We will be back!!

We come here primarily because it is a Christian-based, young child friendly space with relaxed atmosphere. We appreciate this safe-space for our family.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

Review: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: Finally gave them a try. Not sure what I was to expect but my family enjoyed it. I wish the toddler area had more for more developed toddlers who are ready for the general area but not ready for the bigger kids or don‚Äôt meet height requirements. Not sure if they do this but I suggest offering designated sensory play times so children can explore with less restrictions and potential chaos. However, the service was great. I actually really enjoyed the cheese pizza more than I‚Äôd like to admit. We got a membership for my son so we‚Äôll be frequenting.

Review: 100% unacceptable climate!

We have a Funville pass for the kids.  We went today to give the kids a place to play out of the heat, humidity, and sun. I was sweating just sitting at a table, and I am in good shape. The play area was a bit cooler, but all three kids were covered in sweat, back at the table, and ready to leave after 20 minutes. They normally spend 2 hours there. I won't lie, I was glad they asked to leave as I was about to suggest it myself. Go hydrated and prepare to be uncomfortable. As an HVAC tech, I want to go back with my infrared thermometer to gauge the outputs.

Review: The bathroom smelled like well water/rotten egg smell like you get with corroded pipes or something. The rest of the facility was clean and smelled fine. Staff was helpful and friendly. The pizza was actually not bad. The mac n cheese bites were good. The fruit tray was fine. The soda was like generic orange and fruit punch, but it was edible. Party room is the best deal, the rooms are quiet with good AC. The common areas were really warm and really loud. The arcade is pricey, as most are. The play area is in good working condition. Anyway, would recommend for a party. For regular play eh, too loud to have good conversation with friends if you're just in the common areas. For a party you can bring your own streamers, balloons, decor and cupcakes. Funville provides ice cream cups and pizza, etc.

Let‚Äôs not mention the disgusting amount of trash we saw as we got there at 10am right when they opened today. This place Is a complete hazard right now. The mats are all disgusting‚Ä¶ the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. Trash and food particles throughout the playground. Lots of areas broken(ring area has ropes about to break any moment. Some other moms in the area mentioned a kid throwing up recently from the second level and employees not even shutting down the building to completely sanitize- kids were walking through throw up tracking it everywhere. No wonder we all got so sick after our last visit. You are charging people full price for a facility that half works.   You should be providing a safe environment for children to play. This is far from that. Gross you should be ashamed of yourselves.

Review: You look at the website and it sells a very pretty picture. Massive playground including ball area with air cannons and all kinds of little air pressure operated tubes to send the balls through. None of them work. They show a really cool looking ropes course all included in the price. Except apparently there is one employee who can open the course and she‚Äôs not coming in today so it‚Äôs closed. I‚Äôm sorry, what? The arcade is about 50% the little crane machines we all know are rigged and the low payout ticket games. They sell the cards showing you such a great discount! Except they don‚Äôt tell you that the games are insanely priced so your money doesn‚Äôt stretch far enough to make it worth it. The play area is dirty and a lot of the foam tiles leave gaps or are popping up. The levels of straps that you see in the pictures is broken and they have just cardboard over the entrances to a potential fall hazard. If a baby gate isn‚Äôt stopping a toddler (never stopped mine at least) what is cardboard doing especially with a 5-6 year old? Because you can‚Äôt go up with them or even really see some of the back parts grownups stay on the floor. I‚Äôm not rating the food because I‚Äôm not paying for what I see other people eating. The pizza looks worse than chuck-e cheese. Overall if you want to pay $30 +the price for socks + arcade cards + over priced frozen pizza, at least do it where they care more about hygiene and safety. This is literally my first review I‚Äôve ever posted anywhere for a bit of scope on how appalled I was.

To make matters worse, we arrived at 11 AM on Wednesday 12/4/2024 only to find the place closed, even though the hours listed online stated 11 am-8 pm. This was incredibly frustrating for our family. We had to drive back at 3 PM instead since I already bought the tickets online. Pictures below.

Once inside, the cleanliness was another issue. The kids' clothes ended up dirty because the area was not well maintained.

With the high cost, incorrect hours, and lack of cleanliness, there are definitely better options out there for a family outing.

Review: Two things to know:
1. My husband travels for work and my daughter and i often travel with him. Our favorite thing to do is explore indoor playgrounds when in a new area. All this to say, I‚Äôve been to A LOT of indoor playgrounds.
2. I only leave reviews publicly when a place is extraordinary or extraordinarily bad. I‚Äôm writing this one publicly in hopes of saving another family money and time.

Hands down, the worst indoor playground I‚Äôve ever experienced.

Firstly, the front desk employee was sitting in a corner on her phone when we walked in. She looked up and saw us and carried on with what she was doing. After about two minutes of this she begrudgingly walked over and the greeting we were given was: ‚Äúyou do know we close at 8 right?‚Äù not even a hello. To which I replied, ‚Äúyes.‚Äù It was 6pm so I understood the attempt to make sure I was informed, but that wasn‚Äôt the intent as she followed with: ‚Äúwe WILL close at 8pm, the lights will be cut off at 8:20 and you still have to pay full price.‚Äù Trying to stay positive I said ‚Äúi understand, it‚Äôs no problem.‚Äù She made it very clear that she did not want to be there and that she did not want us there. I‚Äôve never had a more miserable encounter. She talked so fast and low that I could barley understand anything she said and when I asked her to repeat, she made no adjustment, rather pointed to something that explained what she said or repeated it the same.

It cost just my daughter and I $40 to play. We‚Äôve been to some incredibly nice indoor playgrounds, some in expensive locations, but this is the most I have ever paid, by far. My daughter is three and very chill, so she‚Äôs right on the cusp of wanting to be in the toddler area and wanting to explore the ‚Äúbig kid‚Äù area. So, you can pay $15 for your kid to play in the toddler zone, which is a tiny area more targeted for babies or $25 for everything. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù being the toddler area and ‚Äúbig kid‚Äù play area; not the arcade, ropes course or the slides. Which the ropes course area and fun slides weren‚Äôt even opened. I know all of this because I asked and instead of talking me through it she pointed to a sign I could read. So it was $25 for my toddler, $2 for me to be with her and $10 for both of us a pair of socks. We brought our own grip socks, as we do this a lot, but it was ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù that we each have $5 funville socks. I have NEVER been required to buy socks if I brought our own. After I paid this, I was reminded again of the closing time and sent on my way with no further instruction. I had to ask ‚Äúis that everything‚Äù because she was so vague and unbothered.

I didn‚Äôt see anything being cleaned until 7pm, when they started closing. Yes, closing down so heavily that I had to find another employee (the only other employee I saw) to make sure they closed at 8pm (even though I had been told this several times.) There is ball section in the big kid area that allows kids to press buttons that cut on air and do fun things. It was very neat and my daughter LOVED this part, however only TWO out of the 8-10 machines they had actually worked. They also have air guns that you can shoot the balls out of, probably 15, none of them worked. At 7pm with NO warning, they shut all the air off. In the middle of my daughter and I playing the air suddenly cuts off and the employee that ‚Äúgreeted‚Äù us came in with a bag and started rounding them up. It took me a second to figure out what was going on it was so abrupt. They were pretty much pushing us out of the door at 7pm. We left at 7:38pm (not the last to leave, still several kids playing) and it felt like we were about to get the lights cut out on us. They actually made an announcement stating that lights cut off at 8:20.

All in all, it just felt like a huge scam. Half of the attractions were shut down, others closed an hour early, being required to wear funville socks, shutting down at 7, it was all too much. A few of those things I can handle, but all of that and for $40?! I would not recommend this place to anyone. Please do not waste your money here.

Review: The kids love it here, and $12.00 Tuesday was much more reasobable. You cannot use household socks. You are required to buy funville approved socks. Typically $32.00 each child plus socks adds up! Tuesday is $12.00 + socks
You also have the option of a membership and you can load money on their card for the arcade area. The bumper cars have been removed and are no longer offered.
There is a decent menu with plenty fried foods,  you can scan a QR that has your table number already this makes ordering really fast. We went with the loaded fries, they came out piping hot. They were actually Pretty good.

Review: This place has a lot of potential due to the size and sections but it is very bad managed. We visited this place for 6+ times while paying around 100$ for 3 kids to play 1 to 2 hours. During our visits we thought that the rope coarse was broken or out of service because no one ever was using it. However we visited this week and my kids saw the place is open went on the line to only get denied access to it  because the worker is not welling to do more than one round a day. The employee opens the coarse when she feels like it and does one round ( 5 kids only) per day. Even if everyone payed the same amount to enter and even if our admission ticket is including this section, we were denied to play just because the employee is not feeling like it. This is not fair for us ( parents that paid) for the kids (why the employee only allowed some), and for the employee that is not qualified to do the job. Very disappointed at this establishment and I won‚Äôt go back again.

Review: This place is so fun!  It is located by the old Chesapeake mall.  There is a burger restaurant in the same parking lot.  They do serve food though.  I saw people eating pizza fries and soda.  There is a QR code on each table you can order from.  This is a great indoor play area. Many levels of fun for kids of all ages. The colors were bright and vibrant and fun at the same time. The play area for toddlers was large and well thought out with many safe things to keep kids busy. It was for kids under 3 foot tall.  My son loved it. A multi level play area for kids older than toddlers maybe up to pre teens.  More than enough physical activities to keep your kids busy for a few hours.  You need a power card type thing to play at the arcade though but modern and fun.  Staff was polite from the time we entered until we left.  The front desk clerk was understanding of my son‚Äôs disability and allowed me to wear an entrance band on my wrist instead of him.  The lady that was in the play area with the kids was very attentive to the entire play area.  There was also a lady in charge of the large slides and she was kind to my son who ran over several times but was then scared to do the slide.  We drove 50 minutes to check it out and were glad we did. My son loves it here. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back soon.  This is a good place for a rainy day afternoon.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the price.  We paid $40 for my son and husband to each get a pair of socks and to have free play for 2 hours.

Review: Your toddler will be kicked out of the toddler section and forced to play in the section for older kids if they're slightly taller than other toddlers. The workers here don't care if your toddler is the right age to play in the toddler section. They would rather your child get trampled by older children. We got a refund and left. We've never been back to this location ever since. That was our first and last time there. Horrible birthday experience for my little one.

My three year old likes the foam ball area in the back, but only one of the vacuum/blower machines works out of six. My five year old  doesn't seem to mind as she's just having fun running with the other kids.  I've gone 10 times now, but I haven't had any food, but I was told it is as good as you would get from any pizza chain spot serving pizza and wings.

Review: It used to be reasonable priced, but no longer. I paid $32 for my grandson to play for one hour. That didn't even give him access to the entire playground. He only stayed that long because I kept encouraging him to stay. The one area that he always spends the most time in was not working.  He loves playing with the tennis balls and the air jets. Only one was working. By the way, your socks are not acceptable.  Anyone wanting to enter the play area needs to buy socks even those just trying to supervise their children,  which I suggest you do because they are not liable for anything.

These parents walked by numerous attendants. There are *large* black dirt spots all over the foam and when questioned, the attendants just said they clean up and anything like this is just from today. Um, what?! There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs from one day- even with letting adults take their nasty shoes in the foam that kids are rolling all over. Absolutely disgusting.

Furthermore adults must also purchase them to enter the play area and that is to only be on the ground floor. So while it‚Äôs fun for the kids. The pricing and gouging has become crazy and we will no patronize this company.

The floors need a really good sweeping and mopping. The tables look like they haven‚Äôt been wiped down in weeks. Some of the bouncy toys are so filthy that I don‚Äôt even think a power wash could save them at this point. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the staff doesn‚Äôt seem to care. The person at the desk is just eating snacks and watching videos on their phone and always seems annoyed when people come in or ask questions. The way the building is designed you could easily get up and go clean and still be able to see guest walk in. It would be nice to see staff cleaning and wiping down toys periodically especially during cold season. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it‚Äôs gone down hill.

Review: Kid Zone is a hidden gem in Powell, offering a fun and safe indoor playground perfect for young children. As soon as you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted with a clean, vibrant space filled with a variety of activities for kids to enjoy. There are climbing structures, slides, and even a soft play area for toddlers, ensuring that children of all ages have something to do.

One of the best aspects of Kid Zone is how well-organized and well-maintained the facility is. You can tell that cleanliness is a priority, which gives parents peace of mind as their children explore and play. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure everyone has a good experience while keeping the environment safe.

There are seating areas for parents, and they offer beverages to purchase, so you can relax while your kids burn off some energy.

Overall, Kid Zone is a fantastic place for kids to run, and play in a controlled and fun environment. It‚Äôs a great option for birthday parties or just to get out of the house on a rainy day. Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the Powell area!

Review: Great concept! But unfortunately, it was not very clean. I wish I had read reviews before going because I now see quite a few others saying the same. There was trash in and around the play area and we were the first and only ones there so I know the trash had been there a while. The play area itself was cool, but not really for my 3 year old. He was not tall enough to climb some of the structures on his own and I was uncomfortable putting my 7 month old on the floor to help him with it being so dirty. The 3 and under area would have been great but a lot of the toys were broken and, again, just very dirty. We may come back when my kids are older, but honestly I‚Äôm not even sure about that. I can overlook a lot of things but the overall dirtiness of the entire place was frustrating. Especially since kids are climbing and crawling around. My 3 year olds socks were black on bottom when we left from how dirty it was. Unacceptable.

Review: Very cool little town area. It‚Äôs just a great concept in general. However, I will say the entire place was dirty. Stuff was under the picnic tables, clearly wasn‚Äôt slept from the night before. The play centers needed wiping down and for context, we were the FIRST ones in there when it opened. The obnoxious kidz bop was blaring at 9 am. It was freezing, at 67 degrees on the thermostat. Inside the climbing area needed to be wiped down as well. The farm animals could use a power wash, so could the mats surrounding the gym equipment. Random socks under the equipment. The wooden play screw washers for the table in the little town are huge choking hazards for 3 and under, surprisingly in the 3 and under section. If a place isn‚Äôt being cleaned down, it‚Äôs not being sanitized and kids places need sanitizing. Again, cool place, just needs improvement.

Review: It's a nice way for my child to get exercise since it's still too cold for the outdoor playground. The place is nice enough and my child has a fun time. It's overpriced in my opinion unless you get a membership.

The only irritating part about it is that there is a little boy whose mom works behind the counter, and he can be problematic sometimes. God knows that little kids can be difficult enough without having to man the front desk while trying to keep an eye on them. That being said, my kid has been attacked by this little boy several times since we started going there and will come home with scratch marks and red skin. He also causes issues with other customers' children as well - taking their toys and being disruptive/loud.

This won't stop us from coming back indefinitely, but just something to keep in mind if you have smaller children. I won't let them play together unless I'm able to sit right next to my kid to make sure he's not being hurt.

Review: Friendly staff and a great area for kids to play freely. I went for a birthday party and the kids were busy with the play structures and the 4 play house rooms. They really kept the kids so busy parents were able to talk and relax. The play house rooms (barn, kitchen, store, garage) could fit 3 or 4 kids each and provide room for imagination to take over. The play structure had 2 or 3 levels with slides of multiple heights, the kids enjoyed the slides with 4 side by side and raced down to the bottom only to get back in line and challenge another group. Great experience and just off Clinton highway make the location convenient.

Review: Today was the first day my son and I visited Kid Zone. We LOVED it! We heard from others in local community how awesome it is (especially for 3 year olds). This is a place we have been needing for a while in our area. I am not sure what Rebecca Sweet from WBIR is referring to in her review about Kid Zone, (from her other reviews and how she interacts with others, it appears she is hard to please üôÑ), but when we went the area was nice, clean, and worth every minute of it. So, unless you want your children playing in a bubble and not be kids, I recommend this place (as a realistic mom)! We will be back and thank you! I didn‚Äôt take many pics because we were having too much fun! üòÑ

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

Review: Recently had a birthday party here and was left a little disappointed with the price factor and what we received. Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: Plum Krazy Play went above and beyond for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party. Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it‚Äôs so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

Review: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn‚Äôt really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it‚Äôs for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!

Review: I celebrated my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday at Kids Empire this weekend, and we had such a great experience! I actually brought her a week before the party just to check the place out and talk to someone about our upcoming reservation. Eddie was the one who helped me, and he was amazing, super helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. He even followed up with me twice before the party, which really impressed me.

On the day of the party, Eddie was off, but two lovely ladies took care of us. They did a fantastic job and were very attentive. The place itself is clean, fun, and the staff overall is friendly and welcoming.

My daughter had an amazing time, and so did all the other kids. We‚Äôll definitely be back! Thank you, Kids Empire, for making her birthday so special!

Review: First time coming today and it was great! The staff is very nice, explained everything well. We came at 12:30 and it was very calm, maybe four families with their kids. They have clear bins and totes to hold your belongings together like your shoes as shoes aren‚Äôt allowed once inside the play area but they have plenty of tables and chairs in front and around the play area to see your kids playing. Lockers are available as well. The entry to the play area is locked and only staff can let people in and out which I love so kids can‚Äôt run out. We have been to other types of play places similar to this but they didn‚Äôt have the area secured like they do here so kids easily went to the front door. Everything is very clean and organized nicely. The music playing is kidz bop so kid friendly and not at an obnoxious sound level either which is great for me personally as my son is autistic. Also found out they can dim the lights and turn the music down more for sensory friendly environment with those needing it or those who request it. The prices for snacks is good as well. They also informed us that we can leave and come back with our receipt as the price for entry is an all day pass. This would be a great place for a party with everything they offer and the experience we‚Äôve had.

Review: First time. First impression, cclorful and inviting. Love that they have you fill out your information. Not sure if the waiver is an agreement to have a background check, but I wouldn't be surprised and would encourage them to since it's concerning children's safety. Kids are enjoying getting to explore. There is a section for 3 and under and they do enforce the age limit.

Review: Down to play is an indoor playground located at the medallion shopping center. It's clean and well staffed. They are attentive to the toddler area and maintaining space for all age kiddos. The reason its worth it is that you can bring your own food and drinks. Lots of places like this require you to buy their overpriced peanut butter jelly sandwiches but not here! Should come back often.

My favorite thing about this place is my back doesn‚Äôt hurt when I play with my kid! The height clearance allows me to stand at my full height of 5‚Äô0! Which is better than most places. Plus this location is right next to a whole shopping center!

This indoor playground is a paradise for kids, with clean play structures, slides, ball pits, and a dedicated toddler area that kept my 6-year-old entertained for hours. The staff were super friendly and attentive, ensuring everything was safe and spotless. I loved the cozy parent lounge, a lifesaver for getting a moment to relax while the kids played. The no-shoes policy keeps things hygienic, and the variety of activities like the interactive dance floor and climbing walls meant there was something for kids of all ages. Highly recommend for a fun, stress-free day out with the family.

Review: I am SO happy this place exists in Maryville. It took a while to get there, but today I finally took my 6 year old son. He has autism and eloping is part of that. Parks, and open public spaces are a no go, because he will run. It is very limiting and keeps us from going most places.  Today we went here after school and he had such a great time. The play area was so perfect for him. He was able to run around free and he didn't stop for the nearly hour and half we were there. The play equipment was all really great. The bouncy slide area was his favorite but really enjoyed the regular slides too. I brought him home and for the first time pretty much ever, he sat down and relaxed. He was worn out. This place will become our second home and I am so thankful they were so accommodating. The prices were much lower than I had anticipated. Which is rare these days.  The ONLY complaint I have is not about this place nor the staff but about parents not watching over their children a bit better. But I guess that is the appeal. To bring your kids and get a breather from them for a second. Not everyone has children with special needs that require constant supervision, so maybe I'm jealous of their freedom. üòÇ Regardless I couldn't be more pleased with our first visit!

They have so many activities to do, such as slides, basketball, air hockey, an inflatable obstacle course, and so much more. The pricing it amazing and very much worth it.

The owners are super nice and very involved with the community. I would highly recommend to all parents.

Review: Maryville's Play Station is now one of my top toddler indoor play places. Decent pricing, a ton of parking available, clean, & a whole lot of fun for the little tots. You can buy a day pass & if you need to leave, you can still come back that same day (as long as you have your receipt) and reenter without having to purchase for entry again. They have arcade games that are free. Snacks & drinks are available for purchase. The only true thing I would change about this place is that it would be amazing if they had a bigger space. But they definitely succeeded in making it a fun play area with the space they have.

There‚Äôs a 2 & under section which is nice for littles. They have a big obstacle course for bigger kids and other games. Bigger kids can get rough from time to time so i just take my little to the 2 & under area or where the little play kitchens are.

Review: I love that they have this place available for children to play. That's very convenient.
For after school, or even during the day they will be moving to another area, so they won't be located inside the mall. Any longer
But with this new spot they need to make sure that they make it available for all ages, from babies and under 2 to the older children they need to be sure that they have these areas separated.
In order to make it convenient for the children and less worrisome for the parents.

We got to have lunch in the mall and then go there to let the kids play. My 7 year old had fun with the gymnastics mats and the games. My 9 month old loved the baby area so much!!! I didn‚Äôt bring my 9 year old but I think he would enjoy the games and mats as well. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs perfect for ages from infant to about 7-8 year old.

Review: Great fun place for kids! My 8 year old always has a blast. The toy stations are frequently updated/rotated and the owners take extra care to keep everything clean.

I noticed another review that said there was no changing station, which is not true. This business has been around for nearly a year and a half and they've had a changing station in the back (next to the party room) since day 1. As for bathrooms: that's simply a function of being set up in a mall. There is a public bathroom very close by, and the owners have zero issues with customers having to step out briefly for that and then coming back in to play more.

The private party room is so spacious and able to seat SO MANY kids and adults. We had almost 40 guests and it never felt cramped or was hard to move around.

We got to use our own playlist and even had a glow party! Super affordable compared to so many venues. Best part: all adults were able to chat and mingle while easily supervising all the action and kids. The layout is easy to be able to see everything going on without being on top of your kids the whole time.

Cannot recommend this place enough! Book your next party there 10/10

Review: Brought my year old and four year old daughter to Maryville's Play Station in Foothills mall with the coupons they gave us during the trick or treat event. It was a nice gesture to hand out those passes. The girls absolutely loved it there. They loved the Pac Man video game, the kitchen set and the climbing equipment. The place is heavily padded and kept clean. It allows the girls to be social and play. There's lots of stuff to keep them stimulated and entertained. It's nice to let them cut loose and do their own thing. If you have kids I highly recommend you give it a try. As we all know scrubbing energy off your kids is a good thing.

Everyone had a great time and highly recommend for your next birthday party. I‚Äôm not sure if there was a sign on the door that said closed for private event but there were 2 families that popped in and stood up front for quite some time during our party which was awkward for us to eventually tell them they‚Äôre not open to the public at that time so that would be my only feedback.

Parents camp out in chairs and tables, so on a crowded day there is no room to sit. Having little lockers for parents and not allowing the keeping of chairs would be helpful for the functionality! A little pricey unless you stay for the day, but great for kids to have fun!!

Review: We LOVE visiting the Little Valley Play Cafe!    It‚Äôs a great place to cultivate your little one‚Äôs imagination and for them to socialize with their peers! You can definitely tell a lot of thought was put into every detail from the layout of the play area to the small extra touches in the bathroom! The cafe itself is also a wonderful expression of comfort. We highly recommend you have lunch sometime and try the mac and cheese! Peak times definitely seem to be in the mornings so if you would prefer a smaller crowd check them out after 12 on Tuesdays and Wednesday for extended hours till 5:30. Knoxville has waited a long time for something like this and we are excited to see this place grow!

Review: Little Valley Play Cafe has a lot of potential, I feel the space they're in very much limits that potential. I took my little one here to try it out. The front desk area is tiny making it difficult for everyone to both check-in + grab your shoes (they make you put your shoes in a small cubby at the front upon arrival) as you're trying to leave. I do love that it's gated at the entry so no kid can escape. I did not feel the staff I encountered was very friendly. I had trouble opening the gate and she didn't help but another patron did. I do not like that they don't allow you to bring in your own food. I already pay for coming there, I don't want to buy the snacks you have. I don't eat lots of the ingredients in these foods and snacks and I don't want a dessert coffee every time I go. I like the idea of the cafe, I do understand it needs to be profitable, but my family doesn't eat what they serve. Makes it hard when other indoor playgrounds we can bring food in and eat at their designated tables. I don't like that so much of the space is taken by tables and chairs for parents. A lot of parents were sitting at the stools by the wall watching their kids. And then they leave their left drinks on that wall which leaves the drinks open for little kids to come and drink from them before their parent can stop them. I also didn't like that in order to go use the restroom you have to wear your socks. I'd like to be wearing shoes when I go in a bathroom... That's gross. And then any germs from the bathroom are now on socks that are walked around in the play area. I will say that bathrooms were pretty clean when I visited which is very necessary and appreciated. The themed play stations were great, my little one loved them. I love how creative they were designing that. I did not love that a good chunk of space was taken up for a party area. I just don't see how this space was a good choice for an indoor playground. I think this place could be amazing with some improvements. Customer service is very important and employee/owner attitudes I feel set the tone overall. I look forward to watching this place improve and hopefully grow.

Review: First the helpful things to know, then I‚Äôll give you the reason for my 5-start review :)
1. Check the hours and get there early. They often have a line outside to get in and they reach capacity often.
2. Be sure that the kids and guardians wear or bring grippy socks. If you don‚Äôt have any or forget, they do sell them there for a very reasonable price.
OK, now onto the reason for my review.
I can‚Äôt say enough great things about the Little Valley Play Cafe and the staff! I went to a birthday party here and everything was magical! The staff arranged for all the decor and the food and of course provided a very clean, safe space to play. I enjoyed playing with the kids in the play areas at first. Then sat by and watched as they continued, while I sipped a delicious latte from their coffee bar. It‚Äôs so much easier to keep an eye on the kids with their open floor plan and safety gate. If you have or care for kids under 6, this place is a must. Great for birthday parties, rainy or cold days, or any day really. Whenever you go, you and the kids will be in for a real treat!

Review: Just Go!! I visited this week to check it out for the first time with my 2 kids since opening with a friend and her 2 kids. It was an absolute blast! We ended up going a second time because it was so much fun -- and not to mention the coffee was fantastic!

There was an incident that happened while we were there of no ones fault, but I watched the owner take amazing care of this sweet boy. After he was all taken care of, they offered him a Good 2 Grow Juice and he got to pick his top. He was back playing in no time. It's always great to see how much an owner cares about their patrons.

Love this place and look forward to it becoming a regular stop for us. I will say it can get busy in the late mornings/afternoons, but I love to see the success of a new business in town. If you want to visit when it's a little quieter, I recommend going in the earlier morning hours.

The owners did amazing job of thinking through things. There is so many fun sections for the kids and the quality of the cafe is top notch. A great new spot in town!

Review: This place is fantastic. The drink and food options for adults and kids are 10/10. You can tell the owners put a lot of thought and effort into everything. The little dips coming out of each playhouse could use some grippers or something since kids easily slide with their socks. Also it would be so appreciated if the person checking people in can politely say something along the lines of, ‚Äúand we just want to confirm that no one entering has a runny nose, cough, or fever today?‚Äù We can‚Äôt avoid asymptomatic people‚Ä¶ however, the last time we went, I saw a mom cover her kids mouth when they were coughing and then the same mom took a toy out of their kids mouth, wiped it on her shirt and then tossed it back on the floor. I just wish the whole ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt bring your kids if they‚Äôre sick‚Äù thing was enforced somehow. I still refuse to give this place anything less than 5 stars and still very much recommend it!

Review: This play cafe is super cute and modern. It smells clean! Kids playing in here love it and never get bored. As a former preschool teacher, I‚Äôd say the play is perfect for ages 1 (walkers) to 5 at most. I would highly recommend someone on staff to keep toys continuously organized throughout the day, so kids experience each center to its full potential. With the success of this business, I also recommend them to expand into a place much larger (small gymnasium size). Other than those things this type of business is an excellent concept. Keep being successful!

Everything is clean, and nothing is broken or rickety. Well behaved children and adults. Good organic snack choices at the caf√© (vanishingly rare for Knoxville!). They are also the only kids place in Knoxville that has kid toilet seats which is SO NICE for preschoolers and toddlers.

The coffee shop is a perfect addition for adults that you don't find anywhere else. They are typically busy but IMO they do a great job at managing capacity. There's a reason they are busy - because they are fabulous!

Review: This is a fantastic play area for kids.  My 4 year old daughter had a great time here.  They have a nice coffee shop inside for adults that has very reasonable prices as well.  Bathrooms and play area are all super clean.  My only issue is that it was incredibly busy when we were there, but that really just shows how great of a business it truly is.  This concept could be three times the size and would still be packed with people if done as well as it is here.  We will definitely be returning, and may look into having birthday parties here as well.

Review: There should‚Äôve been one of the staff members resetting the toys and play spaces periodically. It felt like a kids playroom that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned up in days. We sat and ate for 30 min when we arrived and the toys were never reset. My kids couldn‚Äôt really engage with the toys or spaces tripping on other toys or seeing nothing on the shelves of the little play rooms, and toys mismatched between the spaces. My kids also came down sick 48 hrs after being there. Overall just wasn‚Äôt a clean and inviting space. One positive was the food and snacks at cafe were great options and variety.

Review: Yes, I'm posting a picture of the shelf in the bathroom. Why?

Because today, when I took my toddler to play and stepped into the restroom, what I saw captured everything I'd felt since we came through the door.

At Little Valley, I truly felt that my son and I were so welcome exactly as we are. It is CLEAR that this place is run by fellow mamas; every little detail has been considered! The layout is designed so caregivers can watch their little ones while they sip delicious drinks--and by the way, those drinks are hand-delivered to you, so you don't have to take eyes off your child.

But back to the bathroom shelf. Here you see tampons, baby wipes, breath mints, dental flossers, doggy bags (iykyk), and more. They've stocked everything a mama might need to take care of herself AND her baby in there, and they've done it in a way that is more beautiful than it has to be.

I knew I was taking my baby for a treat today. I just didn't know I was giving myself one too. We can't wait to return.

Review: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if you know to expect it.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: Our first time visiting here. My kids ages 7,5,and 1 enjoyed playing on the trampolines, climbing wall, slides, ball pit, etc. The building is dated but the equipment is modern, neat, and everything appeared to be safe. $12 for each kid to play as long as they want.

Review: My 2.5 year old loved the place. She got some energy out for sure. The only con is that there isn‚Äôt more stuff to do but it‚Äôs great for smaller kids. The gentleman working the desk was super friendly so not sure where the negative comments came from. I was greeted and explained all the rules. Even got a flyer with their party packages. My baby girl got hurt and the guy even came to make sure she was ok (she thinks she‚Äôs a big kid). Definitely a great environment. 10/10 recommend

No meet and greet or making customers feel welcome. Would not take my kids back here again. Basic set up and nothing amazing!

Staff was weird, told my 6 year old who was nicely playing with a toy with his 2 year old sister that he‚Äôs too big for it, then the same lady came running over a few minutes later telling me that my daughters diaper was sticking out of her shorts and acted like it needed to be fixed, (she was wearing shorts that were loose at her leg and her diaper sticks out some times), very weird place. Do not recommend. Waste of $23. Better off going to Piney Town in Fuquay or Over The Moon in Cary, relatively the same price with much better toys and staff.

They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.

Review: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that‚Äôs intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out‚Ä¶. I walked away‚Ä¶ about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife‚Äôs mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn‚Äôt melt. All this to say, if you don‚Äôt pay the 200$ for a party, don‚Äôt take any food or drinks‚Ä¶and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don‚Äôt ask if you can bring anything in‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably get talked about like your a criminal‚Ä¶ total of 150$ spent here.

First time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn‚Äôt help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn‚Äôt put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.

Then wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn‚Äôt wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm super clean I can‚Äôt let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!

Then I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!

Would I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn‚Äôt happy

That broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent

Review: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.

The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.
They had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.

Review: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The ‚Äútoddler area‚Äù gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn‚Äôt get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you‚Äôre going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.

Review: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.

Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don‚Äôt fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don‚Äôt even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn‚Äôt let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I‚Äôm another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don‚Äôt tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you‚Äôre business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up

Review: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back üòä

Review: It wasn‚Äôt horrible but it wasn‚Äôt great either. This was the second time I‚Äôve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It‚Äôs not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.

Review: Really wanted to like this place - it's decorated really cute and has lots of fun things for kids to do. However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.

Review: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn‚Äôt expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol
This was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.

Review: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù event‚Ä¶ this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter‚Äôs wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to ‚Äúsit down and have a special snack‚Äù that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn‚Äôt tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren‚Äôt even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.

Review: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don‚Äôt know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn‚Äôt take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn‚Äôt have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.

Review: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the ""reserved"" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the ""manager"" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.

Review: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.

Review: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews‚Ä¶What you see is what you get in their pictures‚Ä¶Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I‚Äôve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents

Place is priced perfect‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the biggest but it‚Äôs not for older kids‚Ä¶The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It‚Äôs injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry‚Ä¶

The food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven‚Äôt seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child‚Ä¶

It feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more‚Ä¶they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

The extra hands with setup/cleanup was a godsend. Everyone had a blast and we are already planning  for another birthday in Sprouts next year!

I do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Review: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

We had brought our son here a few times before and he loved it, so we thought it would be the perfect place for his party.  He and his friends had more fun than I even imagined they'd have.  It's the perfect play area for their age, and there are so many fun things for them to do.  Everyone talked about what an amazing place it was for a birthday party!  We had to drag our son out at the end because he was having so much fun he didn't want it to end.  Haha.  As far as setting the party up, Katina was AMAZING!!!  She was beyond helpful and so incredibly sweet.  I'd do another party there just because of how wonderful she is!  All of the girls working that day were great.

Review: Angel Island Cary is the perfect way to spend an afternoon with little ones! My granddaughters (5 & 7) were the just the right sizes and ages for most the activities. Trampolines, mazes, slides, a swing carousel that the kids absolutely love‚Ä¶ they also have ball pits, swings, and rocking toys for the younger ones. Bring a pizza in or utilize the vending machine. Not too big that you‚Äôd ever lose track of the kids-you can always spot them.  And Groupon has great discounts!

My daughter and  her friend went for a play date and they enjoyed the variety of activities available, from slides and climbing areas to interactive play zones. Angel Island is a great spot for a playdate or even a birthday party. Highly recommend for parents looking for a fun, safe, and engaging indoor play area!

Everything is nice and clean! All age kids can do something I love this. So glad I found  Angel island fun park.

We went on a Monday morning and it was not too crowded and proved to be a perfect activity to keep him entertained with plenty of activities for not only this age but for him to grow into over the next few years. Highly recommend!

Review: My daughter had a fun time but I felt $24 was overpriced for 2 hours considering the size and available activities. It was mostly 3-6 year olds and kids over 8 are not allowed to play here. I think with such a young age group, you should allow parents to go into the play gym to be able to retrieve lost children. I can't see our family returning to any of the locations.

Review: Our 3 year old loved Angel Island Fun Park. We went on a Friday afternoon. Not crowded at all. They have several reasonable payment options and a waiver you sign via scanning a bar code or doing it online. We opted for the $20 one-time visit (there's a 59 monthly option or a $72 punch card option plus more options). The $20 one-time play option was good for 3hrs of play! üòé We also purchased $3 non slip socks, so bring your own and save some cash. They also offer snacks and drinks for purchase (didn't see any hot food options), or I think you can bring your own snack and sit at the tables, check with the store. We did see children with their own water bottles in the sitting area.  I know they told us no food or beverages in the play area. They have a cubby for shoes. Free ""community"" flip flops for bathroom use (must remove your shoes for bathroom use) Im guessing you can bring your own disposable foot coverings if you're uncomfortable using the public flops, ask the store. The restroom was clean and so was the play area - soft padding for little ones. Our 3 year old navigated the play area on his own, under our watchful eyes. Parents can sit at the little tables outside the play area with a full view. The play area is also fenced with open entrances so you can stand and watch your kiddos. There's also two pay-as-you-go massage chairs in the sitting area against the wall - you can relax while getting a massage. If I recall correctly, the cost was about $5 per 10-15 minutes. I believe their website states this play place iso ages 8 and under. Parking was ok but the place is in a small plaza and if they get super busy it looks like parking could be an issue. We enjoyed our time and will be back soon. We recommend!

First off the lady Katina at check in was SO friendly and a bubbly personality. She was so fun to talk to and constantly was cleaning at different times to make sure everything was clean. Which is especially nice to see during the winter months when it‚Äôs sick season! I have never seen an indoor play space with the staff this nice and the facility this clean. I loved there was plenty to do for my girls but it wasn‚Äôt too big that I was having to run around everywhere looking for them. There‚Äôs also a vending machine that has drinks and snacks. Which was a lifesaver when they build up an appetite playing! 10/10 recommend!

They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.

Review: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that‚Äôs intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out‚Ä¶. I walked away‚Ä¶ about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife‚Äôs mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn‚Äôt melt. All this to say, if you don‚Äôt pay the 200$ for a party, don‚Äôt take any food or drinks‚Ä¶and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don‚Äôt ask if you can bring anything in‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably get talked about like your a criminal‚Ä¶ total of 150$ spent here.

Review: They have some games to play and plenty of space for the kiddos to play and run and bounce out their energy! Lots of obstacles and levels to play in, a slide from the top level of the play / climbing area.
Went today and they have rearranged the kids play area some which opened the play area up some.

Review: Updated review - 5/22/25

First time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn‚Äôt help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn‚Äôt put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.

Then wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn‚Äôt wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm super clean I can‚Äôt let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!

Then I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!

Would I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn‚Äôt happy

That broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent

Review: The worst of the places to celebrate birthdays, I feel cheated, I paid a lot of money only for 2 pizzas, a couple of juices, a poor table and a decoration of the worst and to they liking, the bracelets are useless you can't play on the machines even paying for a birthday party, they don't have music, they don't make the birthday boy happy, they don't do anything to celebrate a birthday in that place. Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.

Review: We've been coming to this establishment for years! We love this place. The staff are amazing. The manager here is very professional. She makes sure the children feel safe at all times! If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!

Review: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.

Review: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.
They had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.

Review: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The ‚Äútoddler area‚Äù gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn‚Äôt get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you‚Äôre going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.

Review: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.

Review: If they had a zero I‚Äôd leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don‚Äôt fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don‚Äôt even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn‚Äôt let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I‚Äôm another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don‚Äôt tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you‚Äôre business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up

Review: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back üòä

The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It‚Äôs not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.

Review: Really wanted to like this place - it's decorated really cute and has lots of fun things for kids to do. However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.

Review: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn‚Äôt expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol
This was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.

Review: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù event‚Ä¶ this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter‚Äôs wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to ‚Äúsit down and have a special snack‚Äù that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn‚Äôt tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren‚Äôt even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.

Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don‚Äôt know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn‚Äôt take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn‚Äôt have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.

Review: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the ""reserved"" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the ""manager"" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.

Review: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.

Review: Website says use there socks. Get there no one is doing this. Go to buy socks for my 14 month old and they charge me and can see he is little bitty. Shows me the socks and says this is all I have and the size was like a 2 to 4 year old size. Oh we can't give refunds she says. Many repairs need to be done in the building. Lots of trim pieces and floor pieces missing or falling off all over. I would drive to another location over this one next time but was there for a birthday party

Review: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews‚Ä¶What you see is what you get in their pictures‚Ä¶Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I‚Äôve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents

Place is priced perfect‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the biggest but it‚Äôs not for older kids‚Ä¶The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It‚Äôs injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry‚Ä¶

The food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven‚Äôt seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child‚Ä¶

It feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more‚Ä¶they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms

I brought my camp here because she checked me and my daughter in the 1st time we came. Because of her awesome attitude and professionalism, I decided to bring my camp. Thank you Monica and thank you Billy Beez. Super Awesome!!!!!

Review: The only reason I even gave one star is because the place seemed pretty clean. My son booked his daughter's birthday party here, and we will never book here again.  When you pay over $300 for 2 pizzas and water, a host, 2 hours of room time, and unlimited play, you expect to get what you pay for.  It is overpriced, you don't get what you pay for, and the employees dont seem to want to be there. First off, when we arrived, they changed the price that was quoted to him, and he was charged more than what was agreed upon. The employee didn't seem to care and didn't really try to explain the discrepancy.   The tv they have with advertisements shows that first responders get free admission. When she was asked about it, she just said no, it's 10% off. No explanation. When questioned about what it said on the screen, it seemed to make her mad that she had to go clarify with someone else. Very poor customer service. There was supposed to be a host for the party, but we only saw her once when the pizzas were brought out. (The same person that checked us in) The playtime is supposed to be ""all day"" and ""unlimited"", but when they arrived an hour early as was stated that they were supposed to do, only to be turned away and told to come back 15 minutes prior. The party was at 4 pm. The so-called unlimited play is definitely not unlimited. They only had 3 people on staff that we could see. That is ridiculous for a place that big, with parties scheduled. There's no wonder that the party ""host"" only showed once. The 2 hours of private room time is cut short, too, because they want you out 15 minutes prior to clean up. I understand that, but when you do follow the rules, then it's at least another 30 minutes before they come to clean the room. Why were you told to leave? The party next to ours had the same time frame and were still in the room another hour after their set time and were never bothered. Had we known that we would have stayed. Overall, this place is just a huge letdown. Next time, we will book at Chuck E Cheese. You at least know what you are getting there. And they have gluten-free options, too.

Review: We had a party for my 5 year old here and everything was very smooth and easy for us. The manager made sure everything was perfect, staff was attentive, and the party room was nicely stocked with everything we could need. This was the BEST party experience for us as hosting parents AND kids in attendance. We received a call ahead of time that walked us through everything and were checked on several times during the party. Food was served exactly when planned. In comparison to experiences we‚Äôve had at other popular kid‚Äôs party places this was above and beyond what I expected. I can‚Äôt say enough about how this location‚Äôs manager made our party seamless and worth every penny.

We had kids in attendance from ages 3-8 and all had a really good time.

While it is one of the larger play places in Gwinnett, the customer service is severely lacking. They do not have a single person monitoring the play area (Catch Air does!). If you go to an employee with a concern, they will tell you just to move to a different area or it is YOUR responsibility to find a solution.
Nothing is enforced and I am waiting to see the news report where a family is suing because of negligence.

Well, we just took an 8 month hiatus for personal health reasons, and on our first time back after so long, Monica remember my boy by first name!! Who does that other than family? She is as kind as supportive as ever.

I also have to highlight the manager Chimese. She is also so kind to us and always checks in with us after we arrive to make sure my son is safe and happy.

Just incredible!!

Review: Last weekend 4/27/2025, my daughter had her 6th birthday party here.  We arrived 30 mins prior, signed the paperwork and paid the remaining balance.  The young lady who checked us in was great.  She told us that our room wasn't ready but she was gonna go clean it and then we could set up. That process was smooth . Things went downhill from there.  Upon arrival in the room,  we noticed that it was super hot so we opened the door to let some air in. The temperature never really got better, so i found the young lady and asked her if the air was working she said that maintenance had been by and said they fixed it.  As my guests began arriving,  it got worse.  It was so bad,  we had to share the portable fans and few guests brought.  I constantly asked the staff to turn on the A.c. with the same response as before.  So we move on to the pizza.  I ordered an extra pizza for the parents and when the 2 bday pizzas and extra ones came out. 2 of them were burnt. We had to send them back, with hungry kids asking for more pizza. I also ordered pitchers of fountain drinks.  They were out of everything I asked for, except sprite. Not only were they out,  I had to go and pick up the pitchers myself.  I also had to serve the pizzas,  cake and clean up after the kids ate the pizza in order to make space for them to have desserts. We looked around for staff to assist us with the party,  but the 3 of them were stretched so thin we could never track them down.  This was the worst party I've ever paid for.  From extreme heat to the burnt pizza, no staff to assist.  It was just terrible. No one offered any alternatives, no assistance,  nothing.  Since that day,  I called the customer service line a few times and have heard nothing back. Customer service is lacking, besides for the young lady who checked us in.  If y'all are going to charge so much money for a party,  you all need to have the resources to accommodate each party.  When we book these parties,  we book them with the understanding that we are gonna get what we're paying for,  ie; un burnt pizza, fountain drinks that are listed, assistance during the party, air conditioned rooms that seats several people etc. I will never book with you all Again and I'll make sure my loved ones do not either. Just terrible.....

Chimese the manager was very sweet, kind, and made sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend Billy Beez for an easy, fun birthday party experience or a fun play date when it‚Äôs too hot or cold outside to play. Glad we live close, we will be back!

So make them play if they want to or not! Family friendly &  clean. Bring something for you to do from your to do list while they play! They will love it! ‚Ä¶

Review: Booked a party here. If I had just brought my kid here to have fun on a Saturday morning, I‚Äôd leave a 5 star review.

The pros:
The play place is VERY clean. The tunnels and slides seem well attended to. Over all the facilities are great.

The cons:

-after paying for a party package, paying for extra people on top of the party package, and paying for food- we were informed that no outside food is allowed. No veggie trays, no fruit, no drinks. It was over $80 for 12 juice boxes, they do not offer any semblance of fruit, veg or fiber. If this was offered, I would understand no outside food- but the fact is, their soda machine was down and all they have is pizza that isn‚Äôt even little ceasar quality and candy bars. If you don‚Äôt offer it and people have booked a party with you, the fair thing is to allow them to bring it.

- the place is not equipped with an intercom of any kind, so you cut your kids loose to go play- pizza comes, you want to get all those kids back in that room? Good luck - they‚Äôre in the tunnel maze.

- they started prompting us out of the room by 1:00. Our party was 11:30-1:30. If we only get 15 minutes to set up, don‚Äôt rush us out without offering help. It‚Äôs rude.

- customer service was non existent, no one offered to help us clean, they seemed inconvenienced that we had left shoes in the room.

- no one wished my child happy birthday.

Lame.

Going table to table soliciting money. How is this safe for family and kids visiting this location.  I brought this to the manager attention and they did not no what to do with the situation.  He was allowed to stay in for another good 20 minutes.

Review: It was cashews sixth birthday and he wanted to celebrate it at Kids Empire. Mother of Cashew purchased the birthday package for 10 kids and you would have to pay for additional kids who show up. LaTasha was our hostess and she hit it out of the park. Things to know, you need to sign a waiver before you enter the main area with the iPad by the register. Another step is taking off your shoes before you go into the main seating area. The kids and jump, slide, run, etc all over the building. They do have some bikes but you have to pay extra, there's time included with the bday package. LaTasha brought us the cupcakes, drinks and helped pick up after the party. This is a safe place to have a party so we recommend the place.

The outside food policy here is ridiculous.

If you aren't going to sell ANY meal options, your patrons should absolutely be able to bring their own lunch and eat at one of your 50 tables.

Your employees shouldn't be made to enforce such a ridiculous policy, especially when it comes to children eating a healthier MEAL option compared to the unhealthy options you sell.

Review: Had to pay $20 for Both my 1 and 2 year old, so it was very expensive at $40. My one year old can‚Äôt enjoy all the facilities so I think he should‚Äôve been discounted. They also don‚Äôt allow outside food or drinks so it can get even more expensive with food. They don‚Äôt allow grip socks and my 2 year old fell and hit his head twice. I will not be back here for awhile. Music is also too loud and the speakers are right by toddler area

Review: Just had my daughters birthday party here and was probably the worst experience I've had, not to mention the most expensive. The package we got was apparently the kids meal package even though we brought our own pizza and cake. So that means that every kid after the first 10 kids is $39 dollars extra per kid. Which cost more than the entry fee. We had a total of 24 kids we spent $957 dollars for the kids to play on a jungle gym. Our hostess was apparently on break and abesnt the whole party. We passed out the food, poured the drinks, picked up all the trash. No announcements are made, no rounding up kids, no helping with the cake. By the end of it my wife was ready to put on her kids empire shirt and clock in and I was ready to put on the dragon suit and hop around for the parade. What exactly did 957 dollars get me? Not to mention, there wasn't enough cups or plates either, but that's okay we brought our own. Save yourself some money and go to urban air or a skating rink if your having a birthday party for more than just your immediate family.}","Texas","dallasfirewheel.kidsempire.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","75040"

Review: Amazing experience, and so happy we visited today. I was nervous it would be a long drive, but it's right off the highway, making it a short trip. The coffee shop has lots of goodies including snacks and drinks for kids, the bathrooms come with a step stool and changing table, and the couch is comfortable. Bring your laptop and use their wifi at any of the tables, and let your little play while you work AND your house stays clean. There's multiple play areas with a house, a construction area, a climbing and slide set, dress up clothes, and even a separate area for 2 and under. I wish we had visited sooner, and if you visit more than once a week, the membership is worth it, but you'll be here more often! This is the perfect place to bring your kids!

Review: Facility was clean and employee was kind. Seating area was spacious and comfortable. Play area was a bit of a let down. There were almost zero toys to play with. The centers were empty. The doll house had no dolls or furniture. The items that were there were very worn.  The website photos make it seem ‚Äúmore‚Äù than what you are actually getting. I understand that toys getting used by multiple children over the years get worn out, but this is a business and items should be re stocked and replaced as needed.

Review: PARENTS BEWARE! Read your waiver agreement CAREFULLY. I was invited to a birthday party by some friends, I guess I was the only one in the group to read the waiver. When you sign the Village Play waiver, it goes beyond the obligation of holding Village Play harmless. You will also agree to ‚Äúindemnify and defend‚Äù Village Play. For those of you who don't know legalese, when you agree to indemnify and defend a business you agree to take on and/or reimburse all legal costs on their behalf. This includes ALL attorney‚Äôs fees, court cost, and judgments. This could make it possible if your child is involved in another child's injury and the other parent decides to sue you and Village Play, not only would you have to pay an attorney for your own defense, but you will also have to pay for Village Plays representation, costs, and judgements. Additionally, this could also make it if a parent sues Village Play for an incident that involved you or your child, Village Play could also forward you the bill for their legal cost because you have agreed to defend them in court and reimburse their fees. Such agreements may also make it possible for you as a parent to burden such expenses under the most loose of connections. In my opinion, these are terrible clauses and even worse business practices. Holding harmless clauses are strong enough defenses for a children‚Äôs business, but clauses to agree to indemnify and defend is a highly offensive legal approach that has the potential to financially decimate an average household income. Unless such verbiage were to be removed from an agreement, I would advise staying FAR away from a children-centered business that implements such measures and consider an alternative place to bring my children and/or host events. In my opinion, Village Play falls in the same category as the chain trampoline parks deserves one star for this practice.

Review: Very frustrated with my experience today. I have been eyeing this place for a long time and finally decided to give it a go today. My spouse has been out of town for work for the week and I wanted something easy and fun to do to get the kids out of the house and play. After packing the kids up and driving from Greenville to get there, we walked in and the kids were SO excited. We waiting in line to pay and were asked if we checked in online. I had checked out their website and facebook all morning prior and no where did it say to check in online. We were told they were full and we would have to wait. Every table was taken with kids waiting so it was clear we were never going to get a chance to play. I left with two really upset and crying kids who were looking forward to somewhere new. They should really post this information online and give new patrons a heads up about their process. We were looking forward to a fun morning and checking out a place to host my daughters 2nd birthday.  We will not be returning as it was not worth our time and money. I took the kids back to Greenville and we had a blast at Unity Park!

Review: As a mom of two under two, it was wonderful to come to a place where they can play and I could enjoy the time with them while also allowing them to play independently while I drank my much needed coffee. This was our first time there and I can say that we will definitely be back again. I love how every little one is able to play together or independently without being trampled over by bigger kids or inattentive parents not showing their kids to be careful around smaller babies. Other establishments aren‚Äôt as attentive about this and this is what set Village Play apart from the competition. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. The owner was such a sweet soul and even came through to reorganize and pickup the centers as more kids came in so everyone would have a great experience. She certainly gets the meaning behind ‚Äúit takes a village‚Äù.

It was very open so I could keep a eye on my daughter the whole time compared to Chuckycheese or pump in up. The place was filled with just moms and there toddlers/ baby‚Äôs .  I am very over protective and still really felt like my daughter was safe here.  I will be a new regular thank you!

The different rooms  provides options with out being overwhelming for kids and teaches them how each room works. The play gym is great for older kids and the big and little slide helps separate while still including everyone. The healthy snack options and natural cleaner they use to clean all the toys and equipment makes us feel so much better about our little ones playing here. They also clean multiple times a hour which is a huge relief! The owner is such a sweet kind person and we thank her often for providing such a good environment to bring our kids to.

Review: So I hate to be a Debbie downer here. I really do.

But I‚Äôve had friends who continuously recommended this place to me, so I finally decided to try it.

I went on Saturday afternoon and the same occurrences took place as this afternoon. So weekend or not this happens. I tried to give it a second chance.

I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old. The entire time we were there (2 hours the first time and 1 hour the next) there were much older children probably 6-10 years old who were running over my 2 year old. Then older kids were in the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù area running over my 1 year old. I did not feel relaxed whatsoever. I felt like I had to continuously stay under my children because older kids were taking their toys away from them, running over them, ect.

Parents do not pay attention to their children in this environment and it‚Äôs dangerous to younger kids.

Staff does not periodically clean up toys (at least they didn‚Äôt while we were there) so toys weren‚Äôt in the places they were supposed to be played in.. they were everywhere.

Staff does not enforce rules and parents do not watch their kids (of course staff cannot change this), but there HAS to be a better way to protect younger children. We go to many indoor playhouses in the upstate and we have never had issues like this.

Over the course of the time we were here today, my friends child got knocked in the head with a shopping cart by an older child running and ended up with a goose egg on his head, older children took toys away from my toddler and baby, and older children pushed my toddler down the stairs.

A total waste of $40.

Edit: we actually came on Friday, then the following Thursday. I do appreciate the owners feedback and credit, but just because most younger kids come in the morning doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt be able to play in peace on afternoon while older kids parents are supposed to be supervising.

Parents and caregivers can sit in the cafe area and see the playground easily. It's a great environment for play dates and a little down time for parents while the kids play in a safe and contained area. The bathrooms were very spacious and clean. The staff is friendly and we're making rounds to keep toys and play area clean the whole time. We really enjoyed our visit and will definitely return!!!

There is a dedicated and adorable space for building/construction,  another space for a barn,  a grocery store,  and a house with a kitchen.  My kids never get bored here: )  There are 2 age appropriate slides and playspaces underneath the slides. I always look forward to heading to this play space.  My daughters gross/fine  motor and social developmental needs are absolutely met here: )  Side note- their coffee is soooooo delicious!

My toddler became easily bored within the first 10 minutes of our first visit here. Which is unfortunate since Piney is only 9 minutes from our home. Also adding that‚Äôs its $15 and some change for an hour I was expecting a lot more. I think adding more toddler friendly activities/toys could easily fix my review.

Aside from this it‚Äôs very clean and was a good first experience for me.

Review: We recently celebrated our son Zayn‚Äôs 3rd birthday at Piney Town Play Space, and it was truly a five-star experience from start to finish!

The theme was George from Peppa Pig, and Courtney along with the amazing staff absolutely delivered. Every detail was thoughtful, colorful, and perfect for the occasion. The kids had a blast, and the entire event was so well-organized that we could actually relax and enjoy it.

We initially had some concerns because we invited a big group of friends, and we were worried the space might be too small or that we‚Äôd somehow be over capacity ‚Äî but the space was HUGE! It was more than enough for everyone to play, mingle, and celebrate comfortably. Courtney, the owner, even called me personally before the party to check in, reassure me, and make sure we were confident in moving forward ‚Äî that level of personal care really meant a lot.

We chose the Pandarosa package, which included 48 cupcakes, sweet tea, lemonade, chicken trays for the adults (so delicious!), and 7 large pizzas for the kids. There was plenty of food and even some left over ‚Äî they really thought of everything.

Special shoutout to Ede, Railey, and Madison who were absolutely wonderful ‚Äî so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the entire party. Their energy made the day even more special.

Overall, Piney Town made Zayn‚Äôs 3rd birthday unforgettable. Everything was smooth, stress-free, and full of joy. We can‚Äôt thank Courtney and her team enough, and we highly recommend Piney Town Play Space to anyone looking for the perfect place¬†to¬†celebrate!

A couple of things to note: reservations are recommended, and they strictly limit outside food to infant formula, milk, or water bottles.

Memberships are reasonably priced, and the extended hours are perfect for after-work energy burn-off.

Review: The place seems very clean and the different themed centers are absolutely adorable.  The reason that I‚Äôm only giving 4 stars is that there seemed to be a lack of actual toys in each of the centers.  There were probably 20 children there during our visit.  There were only 2 ride on toys, the toys in the themed centers seemed very sparse, and the train table (which was very popular with the little boys) only had 3 magnetic trains.  I‚Äôm sure that the reason is to make clean-up more manageable, but helping children learn to share is near impossible with not enough toys to go around.

I highly recommend checking out the sensory friendly playtime for anyone with children who need a calmer environment to explore and play.

Review: My 2-year old granddaughter had a blast here last Sunday. Kids ranged in age from 2 to about 6. The parents were about 80/20% Helicopters/Free Rangers. Don't judge this book by it's cover...there's a great downtown themed setup inside for creative children's play. Coffee snack bar for the Free Rangers, lolz. Group sizes are limited, advanced tickets recommended.

Review: Piney Town is awesome!  It is a clean, safe place for indoor play.  It is particularly nice for littles to get energy out without constantly having to say, ""No, don't mess with that,"" as we would at home.  There is a separate space for 2 and under to enjoy age-appropriate toys.  The bigger-kid space offers costumes for dress up fun, a stage for performances, a farm, an auto shop, a grocery store, a police station, a house, a construction site, a treehouse, and an ice cream stand.  There is something for everyone!  We have not yet been to any events, as our little is too little to enjoy them and we do not want to take space from people who are able to do so; but they sound like a good time for kids who actually know the characters.

They had Barbie come out and read a book, then had a scavenger hunt, and did a bracelet making activity, then they had a dance party. My daughter's bracelet broke during the dancing and Barbie sat down with her to help her remake her bracelet. It was really special.
We had a great time and will absolutely be making this a regular spot in the rotation.

Review: 2UPD:
After my updated review, the owners contacted me by email and they were very kind and concerned. They offered me a free 1 time pass to this place and therefore I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Its still dusty, the surfaces are sticky, hairs are stuck to lots of the toys, but it's the staff's fault, not the owners. So, here I am, updating my review back to 5 stars. I just don't want to harm this nice family business. It's a great place for little kids to play, amazing idea and a great addition to the area. The staff is extremely friendly, but can't clean well for some reason.

UPD: We used to go there, but not anymore. The place is dirty, dusty and most of the surfaces are sticky and disgusting. The staff members are very friendly, but constantly staring at their phones and don't clean during the day.

The cutest place for toddlers ever! I wish they had longer hours. The staff is friendly. Fascinating decorations!

Review: EDITED 2/9/24: I said I would never come back here but I have eaten my words and have changed my review from 1-star to 5-stars. The new owners are amazing and have really turned this place around. They have restructured the play area, now offer snacks and coffee, and provide more supervision during play time. They even offer events each month and have extended their hours to include afternoon play times! Piney Town has gone from being the worst indoor play place around to the best, by far.

I never thought I would be writing this review or have a membership (because we are there at least once per week), but here we are.
_______________________________________________________________
THIS REVIEW WAS FOR THE PLAYHOUSE MUSEUM...BEFORE THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP.
My issue is not really with the Playhouse itself but more the culture there. We have been 3 times and the facility itself is great and the staff are always super friendly but, some parents don‚Äôt watch their kids AT ALL.

Every time we have been there has been an issue with at least one kid pushing or shoving or taking toys from other kids (just being kids), but there is no redirection or even acknowledgement from the parent.

Until today, I just chalked it up to differences in parenting and it wasn‚Äôt a deal-breaker for me. As a stay-at-home mom, I totally understand needing a break and wanting to let your kids figure things out socially for themselves. However, today, my child was playing on the fire truck and sitting in the driver seat, when a child literally picked him up out of the seat and threw him out of the truck. I removed the child from the and out my very upset toddler back into the driver seat. I told the kid that he could play there when my kid was done.

The mother didn‚Äôt come over until much later and didn‚Äôt even ask me what happened. Instead she asked me ‚Äúdid you just put your hands on my child?‚Äù and didn‚Äôt even apologize when I told her what happened.

Again, I know this is not really the fault of The Playhouse Museum, but all the same, I don‚Äôt think this place is for us and we will not be returning.

Someone at the door said this was the little girls birthday and it was time for the party so the money we had spent on a present was stolen from the birthday party before. If I was the owner I would roll back the cameras and have them banned from ever coming back. You don't do that to people. People work really hard for what they have. Something needs to be done as soon as possible. (My friends daughters birthday was IVYS )

We told him that was not ok and then confronted his parents. He still pursued them and so we told his parents again. Now, non of this so far is the business fault but then the owner steps in while we were talking with his parents and says we should‚Äôve come to her and not ‚Äú yelled at her customers, that this little boy comes all the time and is just fine.‚Äù My friend says‚Äù but he is pushing our girls‚Äù and the owner just argues back and it it obvious that she is upset and that this little boy is being backed up and will not stop. so we start to leave and the owner follows us out the door, still yelling, telling us not to come back.

Review: A great little spot to take your little ones!  They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Saturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.

I wish there were more gates around doors here though, I‚Äôve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.

Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: Outrageously upset about the fact that Little bees indoor playground was extremely perfect for my four year old toddler. I was looking for somewhere to take him to release all his pent up energy.! (Too cold and wet for the playgrounds). Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny.. Ideal place to stop by if you have children that love imaginative and interactive playtime!

Ps. I will be back day after day

Review: My friend and I visited each with 3 kids 4 and younger. It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue ""Elsa"" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!

Review: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: We reached out ahead of time via email to schedule one morning our preschool homeschool co-op could come. They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was!

Review: We loved our experience at sprouts today! It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment!

I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.

People tend to bring sick kids to indoor playgrounds but here they clean so often I felt safe letting my daughter play freely. They even have a baby area for parents to engage with their almost toddlers safely. Hands down our favorite indoor playground so far mainly because of how clean it is, the kindness and just the right amount of engagement from the owners.

Review: Couldn't recommend them enough! I've taken my two girls (4 and 9) for a regular play date and we loved it enough to immediately book a birthday party for the 4 year old.
What you get with a place like this, as opposed to a chain, is that the owners clearly take pride in their work and are very hands on with everything. Everything is extremely clean and well taken care of, the toys are high quality, engaging and actually fun! The area is thoughtfully laid out to where you will constantly find new things as you walk around, but doesn't feel overwhelming with clutter.
With the party, I came in to decorate with a random box of decorations and Shay (one of the owners) came out to immediately help bring in stuff from my car and helped put up the decorations with me. Honestly, couldn't have done it without her. They make the whole process as easy as possible, they are there to help when needed and you don't have to worry any clean up!
Overall, for parties or just a playdate for the kids, this place is a high quality establishment with extraordinary owners!

They greeted our guests and helped with setup and take down which allowed me to just enjoy the party! The space was fun and incredibly clean. We will certainly be back and I would recommend this place to anyone for free play, events or parties!!

There is plenty of space for the littles to move around and play safely, but it is small enough that you can sit and watch them play and be able to see them easily. The owners were so friendly and the atmosphere has tons to do without being overstimulating. My 2.5 and 15 month old loved and we will 100% be returning.

Review: Such a wonderful place! The owners have created such a special and NEEDED spot for kids in the area.

You‚Äôre greeted as soon as you walk in with smiles, warmth, and *the most* aesthetically pleasing kids‚Äô space I‚Äôve been to around here. The colors, designated areas - everything was planned so intentionally.

There‚Äôs so much to do, and yet it‚Äôs done in a way that invites kids vs overwhelms them. Sensory areas, imaginative play, trains, a scarf wind tunnel, stem activities, indoor playground set, a gated baby play area, climbing and jumping‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all there, plus things like board games, color wonder and puzzles in the caf√© seating area - which can also entertain older siblings.

You can make a cup of (complimentary) coffee, grab a seat, and see your child from any vantage point. Snacks are allowed to be brought in and also available for purchase - plus a water station.

While you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôll find ‚ÄúMs. Shay‚Äù sanitizing often - checking in, engaging with the kids, and making it feel more like a community than just an indoor park.

We love visiting here!

It‚Äôs clean and the ownership takes the time to speak to you and ask your thoughts. Innovative toys, sensory sections, and they also can do birthday parties. Section for parents to monitor is comfortable, and gate entrance once you walk in to ensure your child does not make their way out the door without you. Huge fan and will be adding this place to our list for rainy or really hot days.  Suggest you pre book your play time slot as they do monitor their capacity.

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

Review: This place was absolutely perfect it was just what I needed for a Saturday afternoon with my niece and nephew and granddaughter. Customer service was amazing the staff was great! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome üòé... And I'm definitely going back!! üéâ

Review: Recently had a birthday party here and was left a little disappointed with the price factor and what we received. Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: We made a special trip from Boone down to Hickory which was an hour and 15 minutes one way. but boy oh boy was it ever worth it. my 3-year-old and 7 year old grandchildren have been non-stop playing for the last two and a half hours and neither looks like they're ready to stop. The variety of Hands-On activities, problem solving creative thinking physical toys,  swings, tents even a zipline. opportunities abound for pretend and make believe;  a playhouse,  a kitchen, manipulatives galore. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. The facility is meticulously maintained and clean. My only frustration is that we don't have one of these in Boone of this size and caliber.

Review: This place is way overpriced given the area. I was introduced to this place through one of my child‚Äôs field trip and decided to take my family here only to be closely and physically monitored more than half the time. I do not have any autistic kids by the way. We had a male coworker literally standing close by my kids, even when I was supervising, fixing literally every single thing along as my kids were playing. It was super awkward and uncomfortable to have strangers that close up in you and your child‚Äôs personal space making you feel like you‚Äôre unwanted company. I could not enjoy my time with my kids when I was being watched within a few yards by total strangers or knowing they‚Äôre hawking my kids down. It‚Äôs super weird and it‚Äôs safe to say we won‚Äôt be coming back.

We were the only ones there so got to know Heather who was working at the time. She is so sweet to chat with was gentle and patient with my son who eventually was playing with her and not me.. The play space has pretend play areas and more physical elements like rock climbing and a full sized trampoline. There‚Äôs something for every child here.  Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones trying to find a way to expend their energy.

Review: Great play space for kids and reasonably priced. Easy to find, plenty of parking and lots of different activities for different age ranges and sensory types. Staff ratio to number of kids/ parents was good as well. Footprint is much smaller than Defy but adequate. Lots of fun and great alternative for families with smaller children.

Review: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if you know to expect it.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.

Had we not already paid to play, I would have walked out. The entire facility felt unclean and poorly maintained. I paid $24 expecting a fun, safe environment for my kids, but it felt like a complete waste of money. We left within 20 minutes of our play time and we won‚Äôt be coming back.

Review: At 12:15 we are told that we can't enter with our 3 year old because ""the current playtime is about to end and the next one doesn't start until 12:45"". There ONE child currently in there playing. ONE! There are two parents with him. So, there are literally twice as many parents, including the staff, three times as many adults as children here. Still, our child can't come in, and we can't wait inside either for some odd reason. ""You have to come back at 12:45"" we are told. I point out the ONE child thing. Nope, come back at 12:45. I'm informed these rules ""are strictly enforced and have been since covid"". So, I asked ""why have we not been turned away and told to come back at a designated time the last THREE times are three year old randomly decided she wanted to go there""? With a straight face, the girl behind the counter tells me, ""well, it depends on who the staff members are that are that are working that day as to if the 'rules are enforced'"". Have you ever tried to explain to a three year old, who's now throwing a fit because she can't play, that she has to go somewhere else and can't play because the wrong staff member is working that day? One last try. ""Ma'am, there's one other kid in here, she's all excited to play, no one has ever mentioned this to us before"".  Nope, come back at 12:45. ONE kid! I have no problems with there being rules. I do have a problem that only ONE staff member chooses to enforce them or even make them known. I do have a problem that we were allowed to pay and play three previous times and out of the 5 maybe 6 other staff members we've met, none of them ever mentioned these ""strictly enforced"" rules.
TLDR;
1)Whether or not your child can play without an appointment in a building with ONE other child, COMPLETELY depends on which staff members are working that day.
2)We did NOT return at 12:45
3)You are not allowed to use the restroom to change a toddlers diaper unless you pay. You can't pay until 12:45.

Review: Good morning, I am formally filing a complaint against the Jacksonville, North Carolina Megaplay location. I took my daughter to megaplay early January around 11:30  when I was told from an employee to come back
In 15 minutes as there where three parties going on. My daughter and I then proceeded to wait the 15 minutes which it is now 11:45, come back as to where I was greeted by another employee who stated they have reached the maximum capacity and I could not check my daughter in to play until 5pm at night which was an enormous inconvenience for myself and my 5 year old daughter who was in tears leaving as I had to explain to her that she could not play. I cannot understand how this kind of business can accept employees that toy with children‚Äôs emotions like that. And I will post this review on every social media platform so they know the kind of standard that is being held at the Megaplay Jacksonville, North Carolina location. What a disgrace.

Review: 3 stars due to cost and needed maintenance and upkeep.

My daughter (3 years old) absolutely loves Megaplay. She has more fun here than she does at Zing Zumm and Altitute, both of which we have memberships for.

That said, I think Megaplay is prohibitively expensive as a place to take my daughter. Zing is $100 for an entire year, and for her and I to jump at Altitude 7 days a week for 2 hours at a time it's $40 a month. At Mega, there is no monthly option, so taking her just 3 times a month is as expensive as Altitude unlimited visits.

Can we get a membership option like everywhere else?

As for maintenance, the junglejims have many spots missing padding, covered in duct tape, equipment removed likely due to damage. The bounce houses have airleaks and tape all over.

I'm not posting this to bash, we really love it and would really love if we could go more often and see some much needed repairs. Thank you and please think about it!

He was in the big jungle gym and I was with him. Well another kid bulldozed into him (not so mad about that bc kids will be kids) what I was and am furious about is the fact that he almost fell from almost the ceiling height to the ground level on the ground. If I wasn‚Äôt there he would‚Äôve 100% fell to the ground from up there.
Pictured below is the netting he was gripping onto before the incident happened. When he fell from another kid running into him he was completely under the netting except for his head, I pulled him up immediately and I checked to see if I was being dramatic or not and I was in fact not being dramatic. The net was completely open and any child would have fallen to the ground especially smaller children. This is not safe and should be better handled. Fix this so it doesn‚Äôt happen again or worse.

Review: On 11/15/2024 at approximately 10:02AM My son & I visited Mega play's Center. I am writing this review to raise awareness about discrimination faced by children with developmental delays during playtime. Office Manager of Megaplay left her office door open leaving a safety hazard to all children in this establishment my son entered her office to play on her play rug and we were verbally attacked by this Manager screaming for us to ""get out of her office"". I immediately attempted to explain my son is Autistic and this door should be closed. We were kicked out and I asked for a refund before I would leave. The Manager did grant this refund while speaking in a tone and demeanor not professional or fit for any type of leadership. As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which ensures disabled children have equal access to play and recreational activities my sons experience suggests that such principles were not upheld.  On behalf of my son, I would like to emphasize the need for this environment to become more nurturing and increase the ability for children to be able to thrive here. I am disappointed in my experience both women in this business lacked professionalism. maturity, and the ability to run an establishment properly by using conflict resolution this is a vulnerable child. You kicked him out because he entered your office and then screamed at a parent? I'm mortified...I ask anyone in this community don't allow your children to be treated like this. This business is unsafe, and follow-up will be taken to determine ratio per employees, cleanliness, and overall ability to operate properly. Staff training and creating a more inclusive environment should be required for this establishment to continue to operate.

Review: The set play times make no sense since it is never busy. You cant get your full hour and a half unless you get there at the right time. It‚Äôs way too expensive to not get the full time. Also had an older sibling go into the toddler area to help my toddler get off something and she was told to get out she wasn't playing in the area just helping her sibling quickly so i don't understand that either. They‚Äôre loosing money with the set play times I saw plenty of people come in and then leave because they‚Äôre told the next play time starts in 45 minutes or whatever. Dont waste your money just go to altitude

Review: We rented the party room at Megaplay for my daughter‚Äôs 7th birthday this year. I am someone who really struggle with perfectionism and people pleasing. Thanks to this, party planning means a lot of stress for me. The folks at Megaplay were so kind and accommodating from the first moment I called. They had no problem answering every question I had before booking the room. They also explained clearly the fees and accommodations. In addition, they never made me feel uncomfortable or like an inconvenience for needing more clarification or for asking a second or third time. They also confirmed my time slot and accommodations twice before the date of the party. They made it clear they would do all the decorating all I had to do was drop off my supplies, and there was even an option to have them go buy the supplies for you (for an additional charge.)

All of that is great alone, but the staff really went above and beyond to support me. My daughter woke up sick the day of her party and I frantically called crying and defeated that everything was ruined. Not only did Megaplay have no problem rescheduling me, but the staff went out of there way to offer me reassurance and support that everything would be okay. Not as a customer, but as a stressed out mom thinking way too hard about a pokemon party. The reschedule affected the guest turnout pretty badly and I was fretting around in circles most of the party. Josh and Joyanna were right there for me the entire time. They checked with me every few minutes to make sure I was doing okay. They let me take the reins wherever I felt comfortable, but had no probably helping me direct the flow of the party in my stressed out state. I cannot count the number of times they told me ‚Äúif you need anything at all please don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know.‚Äù

The sincerity of the staff at Megaplay made every difference in the world for me. Thank you so much to Josh and Joyanna for having next level customer support. It was so clear my experience mattered to them as a person not just a customer. They were really able to help turn my entire mood about the party around. I‚Äôm so grateful this is where we chose to celebrate and I would give more stars if I could. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Review: Came here with family visiting. It was very empty, felt very dirty. As we were sitting and watching our children play, we seen the staff standing on tables to decorate for the party the next day, never cleaned the table off, wearing dirty shoes where families place their food at for their parties. When we had the teenagers helping the toddlers in the toddle area, the workers played the voice over saying they weren‚Äôt allowed to be in there, yet no one was in the building other than us & we were sitting next to them‚Ä¶ but instead of being nice & polite they rudely continued to play the sound seeing that the teenagers were just helping.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. It was my first time there and I would never bring my family back or myself. Save your money and go elsewhere.

Then we asked to use the bumper cars and were informed since it is within 30 minutes of ending playtime it is closed. It would have been nice to know about it closing when we came in.
The large obstacle blow up had a hole where my 10 year old son's leg fell in, we reported it. It could be very dangerous for a small child who could fall all the way in.

Review: I had been taking my son here for years up until the last time we came a couple years ago. They decided to turn off the inflatable with my son in it even though they knew he was in there, and even saw us standing at the end of it trying to get him to come out of it. I reached out and asked for management but never heard back. Then my son asked to go again on his birthday on the 20th and we took him. We were super surprised to find that it was absolutely disgusting on the inside. All the inflatables hardly held my 29lb daughter and were all taped but still leaking air. The bridge at the top of the play place had a screw that was barely holding on and was bent. Then when I went to the front desk to buy drinks for my kids I could not find the lady that was up there till my fianc√© pointed out that you could see the top of her head as she was sitting down below the counter on her phone. I tried getting her attention said hello and excuse me, but it wasn‚Äôt till the phone rang that she got up a couple minutes later. It really does suck because my kids love it here but now we gotta find a new place to take them.

Review: I've taken my son to play at Mega play several times now. During covid, they were on top of keeping it pretty clean. They stopped play time every hour to walk through and sanitize.  The equipment has always been a bit worn out, but this last visit, I was blown away. They have let this place go all the way downhill. 2 days after visiting this place, my son came down with a high-grade fever.

When we first arrived, the only thing I noticed was how HOT and muggy it was inside. Smelled like moldy gym socks. My son was too excited to turn back, so we continued.  My son is only 40 pounds, and he was the only child in the whole building. The bounce house he first picked could barely stay inflated with just him on it. Lots of holes and tape to patch these inflatables up.  And dirt. Lots and lots of dirt.

In the jungle gym maze part, there is pure filth. Candy wrappers, dirt,  drippings of God know what, and HAIR EVERYWHERE.  Lots of spots in the maze need to be fixed properly before someone gets seriously hurt. DUCT TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING.  Mind you, we were the first ones there for the day.  So surely there were plenty of hours to clean before the next batch of children came in. There are signs all over saying, "" If your child shows any sign of being sick, please inform the staff immediately.""  Well, it's 2 days later, my son is very sick, and the only place we were was mega play.

I understand that businesses are short staffed, and I will say that the only girl working in there was very kind..... but this filth is absolutely unacceptable at a childs play place.  They charge 12 dollars for one hour. Not worth it at all. I will never ever bring my son back to mega play.

Review: It was great. And well worth all of the money spent.

This place was wonderful for our son‚Äôs 5th birthday party. Our son got to experience another kid‚Äôs birthday party held here last year and loved it so much, he asked to come back and have his birthday here this time.

Just like last time, the tables were already set up, the room was already prepared for all of the parents and the kids. Literally all we had to do was bring our son and his birthday cake (with utensils).

If I could change anything at all, I‚Äôd want:
-Help facilitating the pizza-cake-opening presents thing for parents/people who haven‚Äôt hosted a party before. Or a reference source offered at the time of the party.
-Designated birthday seat for the birthday kid at the furthest end of the table.

Review: Mega disappointment

I've been bringing my family and friends to this establishment for a while now, so it‚Äôs disappointing to see that little to no repairs or maintenance is ever done whenever we revisit.  It‚Äôs very frustrating to see all the out-of-order signs and dirty mats my children are provided to play on. This visit was the most disappointing due to my son's favorite ride being out of order once again on our latest visit. I would assume with the price of entry; it should be sufficient enough for maintenance and replacements of mats and balls for the ball pit. As a frequent customer, I am pretty upset with the lack of care and upkeep of this indoor playground.

I can understand the timeslots of cleaning between but it doesnt seem like thats been happening. No one has been SANITIZING between guest visits. Vacuuming isnt sanitizing. At least spray some aresol lysol on some areas if there isnt time to wipe down. Also, there are 3 very large issues that need to be fixed on the equipment and if the managment just inspected it they would see how children could fall through or get hurt. I wont elaborate because id like them to look through all the obstacles and see what im talking about. Id be willing to change ny review if items were properly fixed. My kids havei a good time there but im tired of them gettinf injured there and sick after being there

Review: My kids have been coming to this place for 3 years and absolutely love it. Besides the occasional times my kids have gotten sick, never had many issues. I have my kids birthday parties here. My concern currently is yesterday when we went at the FIRST time slot available; my 5 year old managed to get their leg IN BETWEEN a zip tie that is holding the net to the giant Playset. Another parent had to run up there and help me break the zip tie as my child was suspended in the air.

Additionally, there was a large hole above the slide that my child thought was funny to try to stick their head through. Obviously I corrected my child. However, this is still a serious safety concern and should be checked CONSTANTLY and addressed asap. Not once a week!

I called the manager the next day who told me once a week someone comes through to check the safety of the net and the playset. She Then proceeded to tell me that the large hole in the net above the slides must‚Äôve occurred the same day because the employees check the nets every night. That is not possible, because we arrived at the very first timeslot that was available that day.

I tried to explain to her that the zip tie was also loose because there‚Äôs no possible way my child could have slipped their entire leg through a zip tie in between the foam padding on the side; She continued to say it must‚Äôve happened that day and that the employees are very busy.

My child is not a small kid. The zip tie had to have been loose. A zip tie that is loose connected to the foam siding can cause a child to slip through the side off the playset, and the only thing holding a child from falling down is that cheap net that the employees supposedly check every night? I think not.

Additionally, we have a birthday party planned there and I cannot get any refund for the party. I will lose 50% of the funds that I paid so I will continue to have my birthday party there for my child and we just have to ensure that a parent is in there with kids, because the employees do not effectively check the netting for safety. Most of the employees that work there are likely high school or early college kids who genuinely don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just a job to them. Nothing wrong with them personally I was at age once with a job that wasn‚Äôt a serious career for me so they genuinely do not care and probably do not check the netting every single night.They are NEVER been too busy the 20 times we‚Äôve been here to check for safety hazards.

My kids enjoy this place so much so we will likely still attend here and have the birthday party where I can‚Äôt get my money back but if you‚Äôre a parent you need to make sure you watch your child extreme amount on that place and be up there with them or have an older child who is capable of watching younger kids because your childs safety is at risk on that play set.  And because you sign a waiver, the facility and the employees and manager genuinely don‚Äôt appear to care.

Scrolling the reviews just now I see another one from 8 months ago where her child also got HFM after going there.

I even wiped my kids hands and faces with wet ones wipes multiple times while we were there. The place isn‚Äôt clean or disinfected clearly. There were only a total of 5 other children in there while we were and it‚Äôs not like a daycare where you have no choice but to bring your kids there and they‚Äôre busy taking care of your children the whole time and may miss cleaning something.

A random child ran in the room and dug his hands in the birthday cake. Nothing was done or said. We were so rushed the entire time, then the best part. My mother was actually kicked out for ""complaining too loudly"" to the 16 year old manager. She then proceeded to kick out my crying 11 year old daughter on her birthday. This place needs to be shut down.

Review: I always give credit where it‚Äôs deserved but I will say I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this play to anyone. For the price you pay for a Birthday Party ( $300.00 ). I have attended my granddaughter‚Äôs and a friend‚Äùs little girl‚Äôs party. And for what price is charged for an hour and a half for the service you receive is absolutely ridiculous. So if you like being rushed this is the perfect place. But if you want your children to have fun and enjoy then I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. Rude and unprofessional.

Review: This place used to be clean and fun for the kids. Today, it was dirty and run down. It was unsafe for my younger kids, as there was tiny pieces of styrofoam all over the floor in the play areas. While we were there a little girl fell under the big slides area and left bleeding from her nose and mouth. We have been here many times in the past and thrown several birthday parties here. Needless to say we will not be back.

I am very angry at this place of business because when we first got to this place we started late because the pizza's was late and then we was kicked out so fast they have people standing over you like you are babies cleaning up the host did nothing at all tell me what did we pay for we paid for 1:30 in a stone small place nothing promised me and my guess was so displeased everyone talked about the serviced that we did not get I will never come to place for anything not even for my child to play games. I am just disappointed and disgusted at the business and i feel robbed of my hard earned money period and will never come to this place again nor tell anyone to go I will tell them to run!!!!!!

Review: I‚Äôve brought my toddler here twice so far. I love that it gives him the opportunity to play, run out energy and socialize, but I do think the play areas could be cleaner. The foam mats are visibly dirty. There is also a play area specifically for younger children (less than 3 years old) and there‚Äôs often older children playing rough in that area. While I was there with my almost 2 year old, there were older kids jumping off of the top of the slide while my son was standing at the bottom of it and almost jumped right on him. I love that this is a cheap option to let your kids play, but I wish the rules were enforced more and there was more active supervision between staff and parents.}","North Carolina","megaplayusa.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","28540"

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: Phone goes right to (unbranded) voicemail. Website doesn't have https, which has been the standard for nearly a decade & makes my web browser warn me that the site may be dangerous or deceptive - was it put up by a child?? Would be trivial to hijack, zero web security - a quick vuln scan shows it is full of holes and insecure container objects, plugins that are out of date and have open vulnerabilities from CISA. Not much for professionalism, between this and the pictures I think we are going somewhere else. When your website gets hacked, it's because your developer left the door wide open.

We went earlier in the day and I don‚Äôt think the place had been cleaned in a few days or longer. Sand and stuff in the ball pits toys in the younger children room area was all over the place! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth $15 to be honest the price should be lowered. When dealing with sand and stuff the place needs to be cleaned up often and sanitized. Yes they have sanitizer bottles around but they need someone cleaning daily. My daughter ended up getting  a rash on her arm the next day and I didn‚Äôt allow her in the sand only the ball pit area where she wasn‚Äôt there long.

Review: We took my son here one weekend and fell in love with this cute little indoor play area. It had lots of different centers to choose from. The lady that was working there was very nice and helpful.  I read some reviews complaining about the price, but it's the same as other indoor playgrounds in Huntsville,  and at Sandy Land, you can come and go through out the whole day. The only reason i gave 4 stars is I think it needs to be a bigger place or take out some centers or toys. It felt very crowded. There was only 1 other family there besides us, and the way the rooms are set up, the kids were having a difficult time riding the Ride-on toys and trying not to run over the adults or others toys.

Review: Sandy land is a cute place, you walk inside and there‚Äôs a little area for snacks and tables if you want to have lunch, they have snacks for sale as well and allow outside food.
My initial impression though is that it‚Äôs wildly overpriced. For my 4/1 year old I paid 30$ which I find extremely steep especially when you have let‚Äôs play Huntsville with so much more interactive stuff and ways to get the energy out. The blow up ball pit is rough, it‚Äôs dirty and clearly used, the sand pit with water was not thought out well, you need to bring extra clothes to this place as the sand room with water gets your kids not only soaked but sandy as hell. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that and my baby was soaking within minutes of playing and then I felt like we had to leave because she was so cold and had wet sand inside her clothes and yeah idk about that situation.

The owner wasn‚Äôt overly friendly and honestly I was just taken back at the initial expense. If they did a 10$ per kid plus 5$ for an additional I could see this place being realistic but the cost for what you get doesn‚Äôt match at all. You‚Äôll only really be there maybe 2 hours max and yeah that was my biggest turn off next to the dress up clothes that were all broken and missing pieces. Like if you‚Äôre going to charge that much money you want to have a really epic time.

Let‚Äôs play Huntsville was way more worth money imo.

Not saying this place doesn‚Äôt have potential but meh.

Review: Was not impressed by the cleanliness level and overall safety.
-Cleanliness: Toys do not appear regularly washed, never mind disinfected. A lot of stains on everything. The blowup ball pit and slide had holes and stains all throughout. The water/sand room was gross and the water appears to not be replaced regularly throughout the day. I appreciated multiple hand sanitizers throughout the building, and vacuuming of stray sand, but overall there are a lot of toys that are in need of replacing.
-Safety: This is a big one for me. The sand is dusty and appears to not be silica free (through observation alone), which is incredibly toxic and dangerous to any one that breaths it in. They also advertise sanitization through UV light, but I have a hard time believing that/and how that works.
There are exposed cords and open wall sockets EVERYWHERE. There is zero baby proofing here, and it was a constant fight to not have my young kids stick their fingers in the outlets. There is an area, specifically by the bubbles and bathroom, that has an open cord storage area that is not blocked off and easily accessible. There is also a glass cabinet with doors that are not locked and kids were exploring in there and getting hurt climbing the glass shelves. It appears to be intended for ""grocery store"" use in the imaginative play section, but doesn't have anything in it and is unnecessary.
-Lastly, a young girl was there with what appeared to be her pet snake, and was walking around with it showing everyone and offering pets. No harm was meant by this, but it should not be allowed to let anyone have animals in this facility meant for young children playing. People with phobias of snakes, and the liability of having a reptile (not being presented by a professional) in a child play place, was not taken into consideration.

Overall I think this place has potential, but needs a lot of work, especially for the high price of admission. People expect a higher level of entertainment, cleanliness, and most importantly safety, when catering to young children, and this place has not met the mark.

It's clean, well designed, comfortable for kiddos and parents. There's a snack bar, an under 3 area that the owner politely and thankfully keeps 'under 3', a place for parties if needed PLUS the best lemonade in town! Please spread the word so this place is around for many years to come!

Great for rainy days or something to get out of the house. *Just a side note for those with chemical sensitivity, it has a very strong smell from febreeze which if you've done your research can be an endocrine disruptor and mess with hormones* My 3 year old had fun though!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it‚Äôs so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

Review: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn‚Äôt really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it‚Äôs for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Review: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: Plum Krazy Play went above and beyond for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party. Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it‚Äôs so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

Review: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn‚Äôt really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it‚Äôs for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: Plum Krazy Play went above and beyond for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party. Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it‚Äôs so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

Review: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn‚Äôt really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it‚Äôs for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated!

Review: Recently had a birthday party here and was left a little disappointed with the price factor and what we received. Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: Plum Krazy Play went above and beyond for my daughter‚Äôs birthday party. Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it‚Äôs so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

Review: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn‚Äôt really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it‚Äôs for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!

Review: Our kids love this place and always have so much fun when they come in.  Our negative experience comes from their lack of empathy regarding the needs of children.  We brought our two kids and 3 friends today to enjoy the teacher workday.  The kids knew that they have pizza there and wanted to eat when we got there.  About 15 minutes after getting there, we went and asked for a cheese pizza and were told they were out.  She was very nice and said she would order more.  She called dominos and was told it would be at least an hour and a half for it to be delivered.  I asked her if we could pick it up and she said no due to health concerns it needs to be delivered?  I then asked if we could leave and get something to eat and come back to which we were told if we left the parking lot our tickets were void!!!!   We waited over two hours and still no pizza and very hungry kids.  If you are not going to allow outside food, then you need to have inside food available for purchase.  It‚Äôs that simple.

For parents considering hosting a party here or just bringing your child to play, it‚Äôs worth it! And honestly, an even better price than other indoor play spots within 50 miles.

Super clean facility.
Friendly staff.
Plenty of fun for kids of all ages.
Well organized.
Spacious and most important, FUN!

We especially loved the fact we could feel safe letting our 2 year old run and play freely.

Special shout out to our party host again. Gracen was funny, kind, and kept our party going. She stayed ahead of our every need and had things ready go. We didn‚Äôt need to ask for a thing. Thanks again Jumpin Jax!

Review: Our experience celebrating my daughter's 5th birthday at Jumpin Jax was such a blast! It truly is the perfect venue for gathering with friends and family. Christina was very communicative throughout the days leading up to our party and made absolutely sure we had everything we needed for the day to go smoothly. From start to finish her staff was incredibly welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure that both our guests and us had an amazing time. With affordable party packages, Jumpin Jax offers great value for the experience. Whether you're looking to simply jump and play or celebrate a special occasion, Jumpin Jax will exceed your expectations. Don't think twice‚ÄîJumpin Jax is guaranteed to be a hit!

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: Our experience at Megaplay Jacksonville was unacceptable. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting ‚Äî sewer water was overflowing and actually leaking into the play area, which is a major health concern. Had we not already paid to play, I would have walked out. The entire facility felt unclean and poorly maintained. I paid $24 expecting a fun, safe environment for my kids, but it felt like a complete waste of money. We left within 20 minutes of our play time and we won‚Äôt be coming back. Megaplay seriously needs to address these issues.

Review: At 12:15 we are told that we can't enter with our 3 year old because ""the current playtime is about to end and the next one doesn't start until 12:45"". There ONE child currently in there playing. ONE! There are two parents with him. So, there are literally twice as many parents, including the staff, three times as many adults as children here. Still, our child can't come in, and we can't wait inside either for some odd reason. ""You have to come back at 12:45"" we are told. I point out the ONE child thing. Nope, come back at 12:45. I'm informed these rules ""are strictly enforced and have been since covid"". So, I asked ""why have we not been turned away and told to come back at a designated time the last THREE times are three year old randomly decided she wanted to go there""? With a straight face, the girl behind the counter tells me, ""well, it depends on who the staff members are that are that are working that day as to if the 'rules are enforced'"". Have you ever tried to explain to a three year old, who's now throwing a fit because she can't play, that she has to go somewhere else and can't play because the wrong staff member is working that day? One last try. ""Ma'am, there's one other kid in here, she's all excited to play, no one has ever mentioned this to us before"".  Nope, come back at 12:45. ONE kid! I have no problems with there being rules. I do have a problem that only ONE staff member chooses to enforce them or even make them known. I do have a problem that we were allowed to pay and play three previous times and out of the 5 maybe 6 other staff members we've met, none of them ever mentioned these ""strictly enforced"" rules.
TLDR;
1)Whether or not your child can play without an appointment in a building with ONE other child, COMPLETELY depends on which staff members are working that day.
2)We did NOT return at 12:45
3)You are not allowed to use the restroom to change a toddlers diaper unless you pay. You can't pay until 12:45.

They offered to refund me the $30 for decorations and a refund for the 3 EXTRA PIZZAS(that i did not order) to my reservation. Nothing could replace the special day that we were all looking forward to. Also the employees rushed us out of the party room smh.

Review: Good morning, I am formally filing a complaint against the Jacksonville, North Carolina Megaplay location. I took my daughter to megaplay early January around 11:30  when I was told from an employee to come back
In 15 minutes as there where three parties going on. My daughter and I then proceeded to wait the 15 minutes which it is now 11:45, come back as to where I was greeted by another employee who stated they have reached the maximum capacity and I could not check my daughter in to play until 5pm at night which was an enormous inconvenience for myself and my 5 year old daughter who was in tears leaving as I had to explain to her that she could not play. I cannot understand how this kind of business can accept employees that toy with children‚Äôs emotions like that. And I will post this review on every social media platform so they know the kind of standard that is being held at the Megaplay Jacksonville, North Carolina location. What a disgrace.

Review: 3 stars due to cost and needed maintenance and upkeep.

My daughter (3 years old) absolutely loves Megaplay. She has more fun here than she does at Zing Zumm and Altitute, both of which we have memberships for.

That said, I think Megaplay is prohibitively expensive as a place to take my daughter. Zing is $100 for an entire year, and for her and I to jump at Altitude 7 days a week for 2 hours at a time it's $40 a month. At Mega, there is no monthly option, so taking her just 3 times a month is as expensive as Altitude unlimited visits.

Can we get a membership option like everywhere else?

As for maintenance, the junglejims have many spots missing padding, covered in duct tape, equipment removed likely due to damage. The bounce houses have airleaks and tape all over.

I'm not posting this to bash, we really love it and would really love if we could go more often and see some much needed repairs. Thank you and please think about it!

Review: Just wanted to share what could‚Äôve been a scary situation. I took my kids here because it‚Äôs always a great time and my youngest is almost 3 years old. He was in the big jungle gym and I was with him. Well another kid bulldozed into him (not so mad about that bc kids will be kids) what I was and am furious about is the fact that he almost fell from almost the ceiling height to the ground level on the ground. If I wasn‚Äôt there he would‚Äôve 100% fell to the ground from up there.
Pictured below is the netting he was gripping onto before the incident happened. When he fell from another kid running into him he was completely under the netting except for his head, I pulled him up immediately and I checked to see if I was being dramatic or not and I was in fact not being dramatic. The net was completely open and any child would have fallen to the ground especially smaller children. This is not safe and should be better handled. Fix this so it doesn‚Äôt happen again or worse.

Review: On 11/15/2024 at approximately 10:02AM My son & I visited Mega play's Center. I am writing this review to raise awareness about discrimination faced by children with developmental delays during playtime. Office Manager of Megaplay left her office door open leaving a safety hazard to all children in this establishment my son entered her office to play on her play rug and we were verbally attacked by this Manager screaming for us to ""get out of her office"". I immediately attempted to explain my son is Autistic and this door should be closed. We were kicked out and I asked for a refund before I would leave. The Manager did grant this refund while speaking in a tone and demeanor not professional or fit for any type of leadership. As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which ensures disabled children have equal access to play and recreational activities my sons experience suggests that such principles were not upheld.  On behalf of my son, I would like to emphasize the need for this environment to become more nurturing and increase the ability for children to be able to thrive here. I am disappointed in my experience both women in this business lacked professionalism. maturity, and the ability to run an establishment properly by using conflict resolution this is a vulnerable child. You kicked him out because he entered your office and then screamed at a parent? I'm mortified...I ask anyone in this community don't allow your children to be treated like this. This business is unsafe, and follow-up will be taken to determine ratio per employees, cleanliness, and overall ability to operate properly. Staff training and creating a more inclusive environment should be required for this establishment to continue to operate.

Review: The set play times make no sense since it is never busy. You cant get your full hour and a half unless you get there at the right time. It‚Äôs way too expensive to not get the full time. Also had an older sibling go into the toddler area to help my toddler get off something and she was told to get out she wasn't playing in the area just helping her sibling quickly so i don't understand that either. They‚Äôre loosing money with the set play times I saw plenty of people come in and then leave because they‚Äôre told the next play time starts in 45 minutes or whatever.

Review: We rented the party room at Megaplay for my daughter‚Äôs 7th birthday this year. I am someone who really struggle with perfectionism and people pleasing. Thanks to this, party planning means a lot of stress for me. The folks at Megaplay were so kind and accommodating from the first moment I called. They had no problem answering every question I had before booking the room. They also explained clearly the fees and accommodations. In addition, they never made me feel uncomfortable or like an inconvenience for needing more clarification or for asking a second or third time. They also confirmed my time slot and accommodations twice before the date of the party. They made it clear they would do all the decorating all I had to do was drop off my supplies, and there was even an option to have them go buy the supplies for you (for an additional charge.)

All of that is great alone, but the staff really went above and beyond to support me. My daughter woke up sick the day of her party and I frantically called crying and defeated that everything was ruined. Not only did Megaplay have no problem rescheduling me, but the staff went out of there way to offer me reassurance and support that everything would be okay. Not as a customer, but as a stressed out mom thinking way too hard about a pokemon party. The reschedule affected the guest turnout pretty badly and I was fretting around in circles most of the party. Josh and Joyanna were right there for me the entire time. They checked with me every few minutes to make sure I was doing okay. They let me take the reins wherever I felt comfortable, but had no probably helping me direct the flow of the party in my stressed out state. I cannot count the number of times they told me ‚Äúif you need anything at all please don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know.‚Äù

The sincerity of the staff at Megaplay made every difference in the world for me. Thank you so much to Josh and Joyanna for having next level customer support. It was so clear my experience mattered to them as a person not just a customer. They were really able to help turn my entire mood about the party around. I‚Äôm so grateful this is where we chose to celebrate and I would give more stars if I could. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Review: Came here with family visiting. It was very empty, felt very dirty. As we were sitting and watching our children play, we seen the staff standing on tables to decorate for the party the next day, never cleaned the table off, wearing dirty shoes where families place their food at for their parties. When we had the teenagers helping the toddlers in the toddle area, the workers played the voice over saying they weren‚Äôt allowed to be in there, yet no one was in the building other than us & we were sitting next to them‚Ä¶ but instead of being nice & polite they rudely continued to play the sound seeing that the teenagers were just helping.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. It was my first time there and I would never bring my family back or myself. Save your money and go elsewhere.

Review: They offer a military discount which is appreciated. But you have to come during the certain play times, so prepare. Then we asked to use the bumper cars and were informed since it is within 30 minutes of ending playtime it is closed. It would have been nice to know about it closing when we came in.
The large obstacle blow up had a hole where my 10 year old son's leg fell in, we reported it. It could be very dangerous for a small child who could fall all the way in.

Review: I had been taking my son here for years up until the last time we came a couple years ago. They decided to turn off the inflatable with my son in it even though they knew he was in there, and even saw us standing at the end of it trying to get him to come out of it. I reached out and asked for management but never heard back. Then my son asked to go again on his birthday on the 20th and we took him. We were super surprised to find that it was absolutely disgusting on the inside. All the inflatables hardly held my 29lb daughter and were all taped but still leaking air. The bridge at the top of the play place had a screw that was barely holding on and was bent. Then when I went to the front desk to buy drinks for my kids I could not find the lady that was up there till my fianc√© pointed out that you could see the top of her head as she was sitting down below the counter on her phone. I tried getting her attention said hello and excuse me, but it wasn‚Äôt till the phone rang that she got up a couple minutes later. It really does suck because my kids love it here but now we gotta find a new place to take them.

Review: I've taken my son to play at Mega play several times now. During covid, they were on top of keeping it pretty clean. They stopped play time every hour to walk through and sanitize.  The equipment has always been a bit worn out, but this last visit, I was blown away. They have let this place go all the way downhill. 2 days after visiting this place, my son came down with a high-grade fever.

When we first arrived, the only thing I noticed was how HOT and muggy it was inside. Smelled like moldy gym socks. My son was too excited to turn back, so we continued.  My son is only 40 pounds, and he was the only child in the whole building. The bounce house he first picked could barely stay inflated with just him on it. Lots of holes and tape to patch these inflatables up.  And dirt. Lots and lots of dirt.

In the jungle gym maze part, there is pure filth. Candy wrappers, dirt,  drippings of God know what, and HAIR EVERYWHERE.  Lots of spots in the maze need to be fixed properly before someone gets seriously hurt. DUCT TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING.  Mind you, we were the first ones there for the day.  So surely there were plenty of hours to clean before the next batch of children came in. There are signs all over saying, "" If your child shows any sign of being sick, please inform the staff immediately.""  Well, it's 2 days later, my son is very sick, and the only place we were was mega play.

I understand that businesses are short staffed, and I will say that the only girl working in there was very kind..... but this filth is absolutely unacceptable at a childs play place.  They charge 12 dollars for one hour. Not worth it at all. I will never ever bring my son back to mega play.

Review: It was great. And well worth all of the money spent.

This place was wonderful for our son‚Äôs 5th birthday party. Our son got to experience another kid‚Äôs birthday party held here last year and loved it so much, he asked to come back and have his birthday here this time.

Just like last time, the tables were already set up, the room was already prepared for all of the parents and the kids. Literally all we had to do was bring our son and his birthday cake (with utensils).

If I could change anything at all, I‚Äôd want:
-Help facilitating the pizza-cake-opening presents thing for parents/people who haven‚Äôt hosted a party before. Or a reference source offered at the time of the party.
-Designated birthday seat for the birthday kid at the furthest end of the table.

Review: Mega disappointment

I've been bringing my family and friends to this establishment for a while now, so it‚Äôs disappointing to see that little to no repairs or maintenance is ever done whenever we revisit.  It‚Äôs very frustrating to see all the out-of-order signs and dirty mats my children are provided to play on. This visit was the most disappointing due to my son's favorite ride being out of order once again on our latest visit. I would assume with the price of entry; it should be sufficient enough for maintenance and replacements of mats and balls for the ball pit. As a frequent customer, I am pretty upset with the lack of care and upkeep of this indoor playground.

I can understand the timeslots of cleaning between but it doesnt seem like thats been happening. No one has been SANITIZING between guest visits. Vacuuming isnt sanitizing. At least spray some aresol lysol on some areas if there isnt time to wipe down. Also, there are 3 very large issues that need to be fixed on the equipment and if the managment just inspected it they would see how children could fall through or get hurt. I wont elaborate because id like them to look through all the obstacles and see what im talking about. Id be willing to change ny review if items were properly fixed. My kids havei a good time there but im tired of them gettinf injured there and sick after being there

Review: My kids have been coming to this place for 3 years and absolutely love it. Besides the occasional times my kids have gotten sick, never had many issues. I have my kids birthday parties here. My concern currently is yesterday when we went at the FIRST time slot available; my 5 year old managed to get their leg IN BETWEEN a zip tie that is holding the net to the giant Playset. Another parent had to run up there and help me break the zip tie as my child was suspended in the air.

Additionally, there was a large hole above the slide that my child thought was funny to try to stick their head through. Obviously I corrected my child. However, this is still a serious safety concern and should be checked CONSTANTLY and addressed asap. Not once a week!

I called the manager the next day who told me once a week someone comes through to check the safety of the net and the playset. She Then proceeded to tell me that the large hole in the net above the slides must‚Äôve occurred the same day because the employees check the nets every night. That is not possible, because we arrived at the very first timeslot that was available that day.

I tried to explain to her that the zip tie was also loose because there‚Äôs no possible way my child could have slipped their entire leg through a zip tie in between the foam padding on the side; She continued to say it must‚Äôve happened that day and that the employees are very busy.

My child is not a small kid. The zip tie had to have been loose. A zip tie that is loose connected to the foam siding can cause a child to slip through the side off the playset, and the only thing holding a child from falling down is that cheap net that the employees supposedly check every night? I think not.

Additionally, we have a birthday party planned there and I cannot get any refund for the party. I will lose 50% of the funds that I paid so I will continue to have my birthday party there for my child and we just have to ensure that a parent is in there with kids, because the employees do not effectively check the netting for safety. Most of the employees that work there are likely high school or early college kids who genuinely don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just a job to them. Nothing wrong with them personally I was at age once with a job that wasn‚Äôt a serious career for me so they genuinely do not care and probably do not check the netting every single night.They are NEVER been too busy the 20 times we‚Äôve been here to check for safety hazards.

My kids enjoy this place so much so we will likely still attend here and have the birthday party where I can‚Äôt get my money back but if you‚Äôre a parent you need to make sure you watch your child extreme amount on that place and be up there with them or have an older child who is capable of watching younger kids because your childs safety is at risk on that play set.  And because you sign a waiver, the facility and the employees and manager genuinely don‚Äôt appear to care.

Scrolling the reviews just now I see another one from 8 months ago where her child also got HFM after going there.

I even wiped my kids hands and faces with wet ones wipes multiple times while we were there. The place isn‚Äôt clean or disinfected clearly. There were only a total of 5 other children in there while we were and it‚Äôs not like a daycare where you have no choice but to bring your kids there and they‚Äôre busy taking care of your children the whole time and may miss cleaning something. The employees could be sanitizing things during the loads of downtime they have.

A random child ran in the room and dug his hands in the birthday cake. Nothing was done or said. We were so rushed the entire time, then the best part. My mother was actually kicked out for ""complaining too loudly"" to the 16 year old manager. She then proceeded to kick out my crying 11 year old daughter on her birthday.

The foam mats are visibly dirty. There is also a play area specifically for younger children (less than 3 years old) and there‚Äôs often older children playing rough in that area. While I was there with my almost 2 year old, there were older kids jumping off of the top of the slide while my son was standing at the bottom of it and almost jumped right on him.

It‚Äôs similar to children‚Äôs museums, but small enough that you don‚Äôt have to hover and follow your little ones everywhere. You can keep your eyes on them no matter where they are playing. It‚Äôs super open - which is really really nice and cuts down on anxiety, especially if you have multiples. I‚Äôve wished for somewhere like this for years.

Review: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: This place was wonderful for a larger space to run and jump and climb on the rainy days! They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: We reached out ahead of time via email to schedule one morning our preschool homeschool co-op could come. They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!

Review: We loved our experience at sprouts today! It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.

The highlights for my girls were; the ball pit/slide, the kid cafe, the spin tops, and the big middle slide. While seated I did see numerous employees sweeping, wiping tables, and checking the bathrooms. My husband and I enjoyed the sweets they had to offer. We tried a crepe and the Oreo waffle, they both were good!

Review: Our children had fun. As adults we were really uncomfortable as one of the staff literally watched our kids and said something to them every time they did anything but he wouldn't say anything to any of the other kids not following rule. He would literally walk past them to come say something to my son and nephew. I found this odd as we were the only black family there.  I probably won't go back. It is fun for kids but not for my kind of people....

As I stated yesterday we were made aware and the kids only went in there once. There were tons of other kids at the same age but of a different race in the toddler area and the guy seen them. He only said something to our children because we were the only black family. And to keep from taking ownership someone who wasnt even there gets on here and tries to paint my children as the bad guy but wont tell you how my children helped the guy clean up as the other children played wild and out of control. My son also had another child flip him the bird. Parents bring their kids here and don't pay any attention once they get there.

Review: My son is Autistic has sensory issues, so I was spinning him on the spinning seats in front of the toddler area and beside of the ball pit, he was laughing, smiling, and sitting with his head back against the padding looking up at the ceiling while I spun him. A worker came up to us, while we‚Äôre actively playing, and told us that we needed to stop because he is ‚Äúspinning too fast and looks like he‚Äôs going to start gagging and be sick!‚Äù Okay, while I appreciate the ‚Äúconcern‚Äù I know my child, I‚Äôm actively playing with my 3yr old who LOVES spinning and sensory play. I could understand if my son was screaming, crying or standing up while spinning.. something OTHER THAN laughing and asking and signing for ‚Äúmore spinning‚Äù.. He begged me to spin him more after something was said and I had to explain to him that ‚Äúmommy can‚Äôt spin you anymore‚Äù he got so upset he asked to go home.. He is THREE!! A three year old, or any child, should not have experience discrimination..I have friends who have had similar experiences with their children whom aren‚Äôt neurotypical.. This place is NOT inclusive for those with intellectual disabilities and I will be filing a formal complaint.

Why didn‚Äôt you tell them kids to stop first.

Review: Its nice.  The hours are so restrictive that its nearly impossible to find them open now.  Also pricey for what you get. If you don't mind traveling there are better options with better hours for the price.  Is nice to have something local to Nashville.  Just wish they could find a way to help it open throughout the week and throughout the day so I can bring the kids there when needed.  Essentially for private events now since they are hardly ever open to the public.

They have 4 rooms for parties that seem to be a good size and a large area at the front with a lot of tables for both kids and adults to use. Tons of climbing areas, a ball pit, trampolines etc for kids to choose from. My daughter loves the carousel swing while my son's favorite is the trampoline area. There are a couple spots with big screen tvs that play kid-safe/friendly shows too. It's a great place for them to burn energy and have fun for a couple hours.

Review: Very clean playgym with a ton of fun equipment. However, it has issues. First of all the food/kitchen menu is basically fake. In theory, they serve both coffee and hot food, but in reality, there's never actually staff to prepare it. I've been here 10+ times. Just don't expect any food except packaged snacks.

Secondly, why is there a huge movie screen playing cartoons??? Who thought this was a good idea at a playgym? If I wanted my toddler to sit and watch Disney movies, we do that at home for free.

Too bad for these poor management decisions. High Five could be great! But right now there is zero reason to visit when you can drive 10m down Independence & go to Playland instead.

Review: Hosted a party here for my son and the kids had a blast. They do, however, need to work on logistics. We arrived 30 minutes before start time and they said we needed to wait until 15-20 minutes prior‚Äîno problem. The email stated we‚Äôd have a room attendant which we did not have. No grip socks included for my party guests. The food came and no one announced or told us it was there so by the time the kids got to it‚Äîit was cooling off. The same happened with their sweet treats at the end. No announcement, no notifying the parents‚Äîjust dropped it off to melt and walked off. The only time someone came and communicated directly with me was at the end when they wanted me to check out and pay them. For the prices they charge they should be way more accommodating to families hosting parties. If you‚Äôre going just for kids to play 6 and under it‚Äôs a good option with accessibility for the smaller kids. I‚Äôve hosted multiple kids parties and this was the least impressive experience on that front.

Review: Great spot for kids! We went recently for a 2 yr olds birthday party and everyone has a good time. There's something to do for kids of pretty much all ages... my 18 month old enjoyed herself just as much of my 9 year old. It can be a little chaotic as kids can run around independently while parents can choose to watch from the sidelines. So you just have to be extra watchful of the smaller kids to make sure the bigger ones dont run them over. The location would have been hard to find of the party host didnt specifically tell everyone it was behind the At Home store, because if you simply type the address in the GPS you would end up at the front door of the At Home store. Overall it was a great time, I would visit again!

Review: It‚Äôs a very spacious clean and fun playground with beautiful displays. However when you book a party (which is very expensive)they expect you and all your guests to be out of the entire facility in the two hour window. They also failed to put the correct amount of chairs knowing the number of guests that had signed in about an hour prior to seat for pizza and cake. The number of chairs was not updated in time. One of my guests felt left out because they took a long time to bring the chair and the little one stepped out crying. It was not a fun experience for my guest and I‚Äôm very unhappy about that.

Review: Not worth the money üëéüèª biased because I‚Äôve been to other indoor playgrounds, and this was most definitely at the bottom of my list. Parents aren‚Äôt allowed to go down the beautiful big slide they have and that really threw me for a loop since my child wanted to go down together. There was also paper signs multiple places saying that adults couldn‚Äôt go on or use areas as well as other paper signs to not lean on furniture etc. This just tells me you bought cheap furniture but charge an expensive price to get through the door. Not to mention, the cafe was not stocked with any food or snacks in the cases and when asked for a cup of coffee well over an hour before their closing time, we had been told the machine was already shut down for the day. They only offer 2 hour passes and within 30 minutes of not being able to join my toddler on things, we were ready to go but stayed since we had already paid for it. I‚Äôm sure people enjoy it here but in my opinion, spend your money elsewhere. The place was also clean, which was nice. The gate at the front had been left open a couple times and had to keep redirecting my toddler to not run away.

The playground was built in such a way that I could always visually make sure that everything was fine with my eldest and that she was having a great time, while I stayed close to my youngest daughter the whole time. Clean, beautiful, lots of fun for children. For two children it turned out to be about $35 for 2 hours, which is above average, but the day was cloudy, and most importantly the daughters had a great time.

You can book your time online, but it is not necessary. The first time I booked, the subsequent ones came simply when they wanted to play. But in the second case, it is worth considering that if the site is overcrowded, you may be refused, which has never happened to us.

Review: Pretty cool place for kids. Plentybof space for a party or if you just bring one child. There are ball pits, slides, mazes, and other things to climb. There is an area for smaller toddlers to play as well. Every surface is soft so no problem if anyone falls down. They have 4 private birthday rooms. Grownups are allowed to play too. They just can't go on the trampolines or slides.I recommend.

Review: I cannot say enough good things about this spot! It is difficult to find a place where infants and toddlers can play safely; this place fills that void. They sanitize and clean everything every 30 minutes, and the snack bar is geared towards very young children. My 2 year old grandson had a ball!

Review: Everything the neighborhood needed for kids.

It is HUGEEEE with tons of different obstacles and areas for kids to have fun. We took our 1 year old here and our 7 year old year. Both had an amazing time.

They are very welcoming and constantly cleaning!

My only suggestion would be quick snacks, and also, if they had music playing, that would've elevated the experience. Nonetheless, it was a great time, and I would definitely definitely be back.

Review: Came to High five for an afternoon play date. We had a blast! We went around 4PM on a Friday. Everything was clean. Even made me more excited to see people actively cleaning as we were playing. The only reason I took off one star is because the price is a bit steep for a 2 hour playtime. I only brought one of my two kids but I can‚Äôt imagine a family paying for more than 2 kids. This place is definitely geared to kids 10 and under. They have little baby sections for little ones to play on. Socks are required which is great! Hand sanitizer stations posted everywhere and lots of spaces for parents to sit out and chill. Even a place for parents who need to charge their phones, use their computers, or even moms to plug up to pump. They also have a cafe that serves food. We were going out to eat afterwards so we didn‚Äôt get to use those services. It overall we enjoyed and though the price is higher than others, we will be back!

Review: The establishment is clean, and maintained well, it was not very busy today which was nice,   Removed stars for not having any saftey measures for kids leaving with correct adults and the gate to the exit was not consistently shut either and the front door wouldn‚Äôt completely shut either   ‚Ä¶ when we got here it was so hot inside everyone was sweating even people sitting down- I personally bumped the ac to a comfortable level bc no employees were‚Ä¶ overpriced, (15 min down the road I can pay half of what I pay for 1 here )-  the food options are not healthy at all,   And there are tvs in multiple spots ‚Ä¶.  Which for some would be a  non issue but for people bringing kids who are screen free the kids just stare at the tv and video game tv  in the ball pit and barely play with the eqpt we overpaid for.  ‚Ä¶. Not allowed to go down the slide with the toddler. Means  we now have to keep redirecting away from the slide and this one loves slides. The ‚Äúlittle‚Äù slides are great for 6-9 month olds, but not 2 year olds.  the spinning car thing has broken pedals  it was not a horrible time, but it def could be better

Review: This place is amazing for toddlers. It is very clean and very toddler friendly. They have put a lot of thought into protecting all of the potential hazards for a small kid who is just learning how to walk. My toddler really enjoyed it, and the staff was always cleaning. We would highly recommend this place for anyone who has more children, they have a larger area for bigger kids as well. The place is also very aesthetically beautiful. It‚Äôs a little hard to find at first since it is behind the home store.

Review: We usually go to Playland but came here with our friends a few weeks ago instead since it's closer to our home. With a 4 year old, for a few dollars more than Playland, she had a fantastic time. Absolutely loved all the play equipment. It felt pretty clean, was very spacious, had more things that parents could sit on closer to the kids if they needed help, and truly it was worth the extra dollar or two above Playland to not have to drive all the way down there.
However, the one negative thing I would say is that there's absolutely no security measures for the children or parents. There's no name tags to double check and make sure you're bringing your child out with you or someone else's kid. I felt very concerned the entire time that I had to keep a lookout near the door and make sure no creeps had come in.
Would really appreciate it if you guys have a name system and check on the tags before the parents and children leave. Playland does that.

Review: I‚Äôve visited High-five Playhouse twice now and my son and I really enjoy it. My son recently had a birthday party there last weekend and we had overall a good experience but I do wish our party host told us to leave in a kinder manner. Our party was over at 12 and we were out of the play area by 12:15. The party room was completely empty by 12 pm. We were on the side where the chairs were by 12:15 gathering last minute things but by 12:20 our party host came to me and told us we had to leave now and was very rude about it. I understand that we were still in the building 20 mins after party time but we were not in the party room or play area whatsoever.. just on the side gathering things and putting kids shoes on. I would understand more if the facility was busier or if we were in anyone‚Äôs way but like I mentioned, our party room was empty and the next party hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. At 12:20 the building alone wasn‚Äôt even as busy as it was 30 mins prior. I‚Äôm really big on customer service and I wish our birthday party experience didn't end that way. I also wish they wouldn‚Äôt tell us to start packing up 15 mins before our party time ends which cuts us short of our 2hours that we have booked. I wish they had longer slots in between parties to avoid people from feeling rushed to leave.

Place is very clean and the staff are seen constantly cleaning up around the kids, ensuring the balls stay in the pits and the building blocks stay in their designated areas. Drinks and pizza wasn't too high. Came at 3pm on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. Friendly staff.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Review: Loved it here! It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid‚Äôs diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It‚Äôs a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it‚Äôs been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we‚Äôd happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it‚Äôs very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it‚Äôs just perfect. I need to come here more often.

They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it‚Äôs hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland‚Äôs space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.

Review: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn‚Äôt as crowded or busy and it‚Äôs smaller so it wasn‚Äôt as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: Really happy with our first visit and we will be back. My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted. We purchased tickets and filled out the waiver online so we had no wait checking in. The cafe was convenient to the play area and had a lot of items for adults and kids; staff were attentive; and the bathrooms were tidy.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Place is clean and they have activities for every kid. Even the very small kids.

There are plenty of tables to sit.

They have coffee and snacks like waffles, hot dogs and potato chips.

Parking is easy, they have plenty of space outside.

Perfect activity for when is too hot outside.

If it is not too busy you don‚Äôt need a reservation.

Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.

The coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.

This place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!

Review: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It‚Äôs a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it‚Äôs been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we‚Äôd happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.

Review: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it‚Äôs hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland‚Äôs space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: My son is 3 1/2 and he loves this place, he is on the spectrum and has not ever been very social until we started exposing him to the wonderful atmosphere of kids corner, he used to get upset by other kids being around him but after seeing how kids are in that environment my son started to come out of his shell and interact with the other kids more, and he absolutely loved the bluey events we‚Äôve been to. All of the staff is very attentive and friendly, only thing I think would be an improvement is a toddler step up potty seat in one of the bathrooms, but I did end up purchasing a travel potty seat to take there and to other places which ended up being an extremely handy purchase. But all in all we love kids corner, I love the Montessori theme, it‚Äôs very calm, until it‚Äôs packed in there then it‚Äôs less calm lol

It is a smaller play space with good visibility around the room so you don‚Äôt have to sweat if your little one takes off to find a new toy. They have an art area, 2 bathrooms, a nursing room, and lots of tables/chairs/several high chairs around the room.

My 18 month old loves their play kitchen, trampoline, and ball pit. We‚Äôve met up with older cousins and friends and they also enjoy everything the space has to offer! The Thursday music classes are so fun too!

Review: Very nice, clean, and safe place for your kids to play and get some energy out. Best for kids 1-6yo. I could see older kids getting bored easily, but if you have older siblings in the 7-10yo range, they could have fun too. Usually, it's not too busy from what I've seen and relatively quiet, so it's a nice place for parents to hang out as well. It's not as big as some other play gyms that we've been to so you might think your kids won't play as long, but we've found that we have to drag our kids (5 & 2yo) out after 90mins.

Review: We come here to play very frequently but we recently had my daughter‚Äôs party there and it was incredible, the best place to have a kids party from ages 0-6. It was so nice to have the whole place to let the kids play and just relax. The facility is extremely clean (the staff can be seen cleaning multiple times a day), the environment is calm and welcoming (not chaotic like other kids play places), and they also have a private nursing room. They even add a bounce house for the kids! The staff was extremely helpful and willing to make any vision come true. We will be using them for years to come for our parties!

Clean, kind staff, organized, quality toys, and art projects or sensory bins are available! Love that my baby can crawl around and my 4 year old can play independently while I can always see them throughout the building. Great place for 6 and under !

Review: I‚Äôve brought my daughter here a handful of times so far, and we‚Äôll definitely continue our visits. Everyone is always so friendly and welcoming. The play stations are so cute, organized, and most importantly - CLEAN. I never get an icky feeling. My daughter always has a blast, so it only made sense to have her 2nd birthday party here. We purchased the Ultimate Party package and it was well worth the investment. The process was fairly simple. I spoke with Alex about our vision for the party, sent my Pinterest board and the rest was history. Communication is prompt and efficient and expectations are clearly stated. Which I love! I become very detail oriented with things like this and I really appreciate thoroughness. On the flip side It felt so weird not doing anything bc with her 1st birthday, we did it alllll. DIY stuff, set up, break down, renting a venue, food, hiring a vendor for balloons, etc. It was just a lot! So going from being really hands on, to just showing up, taking pictures and having fun‚Ä¶. it was different and a much needed change of pace. And we definitely saved more money! Everything was absolutely beautiful and my girl and out fam/friends had so much fun. There was something for all the kiddos to enjoy. Brittney was our party host and she was just so warm and attentive! She really took great care of us. This is such a long review, but this place is truly 10/10 across the board. Cayla and Alex are so talented and I so appreciate the way they handle business!

Review: This is the BEST place for birthday parties. They take such good care of you and your guests. Plus, they are experts in decorations. From the very start of our booking to the party, they will handle everything and walk with you each step of the way. When I wasn‚Äôt sure what decorations I‚Äôd like, the owner created an entire vision board for me. She executed everything perfectly and brought that vision to life. I 100% recommend this place for parties and regular play. The littles will love it!

Review: We have been for a Spiderman event and had a birthday party for our kiddo here. Both of my kids a crawler/new Walker and a preschool age have a great time. There are smart spaces set up for a wide variety of ages. We did the basic party package and it was wonderful. We didn‚Äôt feel like we were being bossed around. It felt like having a party at your very clean home with a great host. I believe Cayla is the one who helped us set up our own decorations, served pizza and cupcake and juice and made sure even us parents and adults had food, helped solve a balloon issue, helped us tear down and pack everything away, shuttled presents into a little cubby and helped pick up paper. So so helpful and kind. (I ended up re-reading their party policies the week before and noticed they don‚Äôt allow balloon garlands brought in which I was planning to do so I‚Äôm really glad I saw that and that there is a party schedule on there. I would have been pretty disappointed had I not reacquainted myself with those via their website so be sure to check those out). Overall I would def recommend! The parents/grandparents loved it. The floors are super clean for crawlers. NOBODY got sick which I know is weird to include but for a kids place I just assume we will be sick with something. So they are clearly cleaning very well. This was the easiest birthday party I‚Äôve ever done for my kid and that‚Äôs saying a whole lot!

Review: Kids Corner of Murfreesboro is truly such a special place! Indoor play has been taken to a new level at KC, entertaining little ones of all ages, and providing parents with a peaceful atmosphere for their kids to play and learn. The perfectly curated play stations give kids so many options without overwhelming them with all of the toys at once. No more overstimulation! Children are encouraged to use their imagination‚Ä¶and they do!! We recently booked the Ultimate Package birthday party for our 4 year old and could not have been more pleased. KC made our vision come to life and set up the most magical day for our daughter and her friends. Kids of all ages, newborn to 6, played and laughed and enjoyed all that KC has to offer. Everything we needed was provided. We just showed up, a dream come true! It was the most perfect day at this incredible place. Don‚Äôt hesitate to take your kids for an afternoon of fun or book your next party with these amazing people!! 5 out of 5 stars!

Review: This place is pretty neat, but they are not very customer oriented - granted my sample size is now two visits. Today I drove my son 40 minutes for an hour of play with his grandparents only to be greeted by the staff closing the doors for the day because ""they hadn't seen any business for a little while."" I explained we were there to play and had driven 40 minutes only for the staff member to ignore me and continue closing the doors. Pretty wild to be honest.

Such an awesome, unique place for my little one to get to play with other little ones. From getting to dress up and play pretend in a coffee shop, to dressing up in a police outfit and riding a car around playing pretend, to playing in the ball pit with new friends, or playing with cars with new friends, I recommend this place to any parent of littles! PLUS, there‚Äôs the perk of them being able to go to a place, and not having to worry about the deep cleaning of a playroom at home! Their atmosphere is so amazing and the staff is so friendly. Plus, all the stations were SO clean! We will definitely be back every opportunity we are able to be back!

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: Nice place, easy to find. But I was very disappointed to see the lack of care from the staff. There were teenagers or very young adults playing rough and jumping on the trampoline. I was surprised they didn't break them on how they were jumping. The staff didn't do anything to inforce rules.
I was very impressed with the size of the party room. I'm not sure if I will be back. But the kids had fun. That's all that mattered.

Review: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if you know to expect it.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.

The only reason I didn‚Äôt give five stars was because I wish the hours were later in the evenings. My husband and I work opposite shifts and we would utilize the membership more if we had later hours. Not many kids are there to socialize with during school hours and shift changing at 5:30pm doesn‚Äôt allow much play time.

We bought a one month membership and went a few times each week. It's very clean compared to some other play cafes we've visited. I saw the employees vacuuming, taking the trash out, and checking the bathrooms regularly. All of the employees were very kind and friendly. Even the other parents were wonderful and handled little kid disagreements/rowdiness very well.

On top of that, it was a great place to get some work done while my little one played. Comfy seats, fast internet, and we were able to bring in our lunch. So grateful to have had this experience!

Didn‚Äôt say a word and had the whole area cleaned up by 3:05. Meanwhile we were scrambling to get our son‚Äôs birthday presents put away so they didn‚Äôt get swept off the table into a trash can.

I was under the impression that we would be find to hang out afterwards since there wasn‚Äôt a party after us, but instead it felt like we got swept out the door at 2:55.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great for just showing up to play, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the over priced birthday fee. They‚Äôll rush you out the door before your end time.

Review: The area is large and seemed clean- a lot of seating
But parents do NOT supervise their older children. Kids were climbing up the slides, sitting on top of the slides, JUMPING on the slides. My poor kids tried to go down and got hit with a giant ball once and kicked in the back of the head the entire ride down the second time they tried to go down. Older kids running and jumping into the small kids area. Ended up leaving worried my kids were going to get badly hurt by the older children.
They were just running around doing whatever they wanted and their parents didn‚Äôt say a word.
Oh and one kid was throwing a giant ball as hard as he could and hit me (holding a newborn baby) and also hit another parent and their child.

‚Ä¢Fun place for kids
‚Ä¢Unique mismatch seating, super cute!
‚Ä¢Matching throw away wristbands for parent/child for safety when leaving
‚Ä¢Staff is very kind
‚Ä¢Bathroom has an hourly check
‚Ä¢Usually not busy when normal school is in session
‚Ä¢All day pass!
‚Ä¢Very clean looking set up
‚Ä¢Multikid discount!
‚Ä¢I did see staff did vacuum and sanitize tables after about 2 hours of being there
Cons:
‚Ä¢Parking really sucks, I didn't know this was on main Street üòÇ which is no ones fault but be ready to drive looking for parking
‚Ä¢Staff don't watch anything going on around the playground to enforce any rules, everytime I looked up they were on their phone.
‚Ä¢Bathroom only has 2 stalls, and we ended up having to use the boys bathroom so my child could use the potty, and the small boy stall doesn't have a lock.
‚Ä¢The sound echos so loud off the walls so be ready if there is a large group of kids (staff did say its not normally this busy- its just spring break)

Review: We come to the play pit often so I can work while my child (4) can play and have never had an issue. Today I had to complain twice to an employee about a group of bigger kids harassing my son. They punched him in the stomach a couple times and I mentioned it and asked how I should handle it - to which she said she had already had to talk to the father once. Then it happened again my son ran up to me holding his head and nose because they hit him again. I talked to the father after that time and he talked to the boy. Then I heard my son yelling so went to see and they had chased him again and he said they spit at him and were chasing him. We decided to leave after that because he was too worried to even play and I was on edge. I don‚Äôt feel it was fair that we left because my son was uncomfortable when there was no repercussion for the older kids. I was told the cut off age is 12 but that seems much too old considering the majority is 3-6 it seems and some of these kids were twice his size. I hate to leave a negative review because we do love coming here but I feel that something else should have been done.

Review: The Play Pit is Norman's only indoor playground and does it so well! ü§ó

Being in a kid-centered environment can be a bit uncomfortable and overwhelming after a while. Still, the Play Pit's cozy antique rocking chairs and furniture, complemented by the modern-chic aesthetic, make you feel like you brought your kids over to your cute friend's house to play. It's as cozy and comfortable for adults as it is entertaining for their kids. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

The historic architecture enchants your visual sense, and it is such a great example of adaptive reuse with what would feel like a contradiction in housing a playground, but it fits oh-so-well. We are used to traveling an hour to Edmond for a similar center, and although Edmond's is larger, the aesthetic at the Play Pit appeals to the adults more and makes it a comfy place to hang out and not feel like you are surrounded by raging children. üòå

The staff is friendly, and it always smells fresh in there. On more than one occasion, I have witnessed them actively cleaning surfaces and the air with Lysol and other anti-bac/viral products.

Finally, with the price of $13 for the first kid and $10 for additional kids and re-entry allowed, it makes for a fun family experience you can feel good about! üôåü•≥ They also offer monthly passes, birthday parties, and private parties.

Last, but not least they offer an assortment of snacks and coffee for sale, in addition to bringing your own food if you keep it out of the playground areas. üõù

It's great, my 2yo and 6yo both love it but the gate on the toddler area is broken and has been for a while and the  little ones just run out all the time and get clobbered (on accident) by the bigger kids. Fix the gate and it's 5 stars

The kids had fun playing and then had two tables for the birthday party, which were mostly arranged by an employee.

Staff was weird, told my 6 year old who was nicely playing with a toy with his 2 year old sister that he‚Äôs too big for it, then the same lady came running over a few minutes later telling me that my daughters diaper was sticking out of her shorts and acted like it needed to be fixed, (she was wearing shorts that were loose at her leg and her diaper sticks out some times), very weird place. Do not recommend. Waste of $23. Better off going to Piney Town in Fuquay or Over The Moon in Cary, relatively the same price with much better toys and staff.

What stands out most is their commitment to cleanliness and safety‚ÄîShay (the owner) is constantly cleaning toys and surfaces while the kids play. It gives me such peace of mind.

You‚Äôre greeted as soon as you walk in with smiles, warmth, and *the most* aesthetically pleasing kids‚Äô space I‚Äôve been to around here. The colors, designated areas - everything was planned so intentionally.

There‚Äôs so much to do, and yet it‚Äôs done in a way that invites kids vs overwhelms them. Sensory areas, imaginative play, trains, a scarf wind tunnel, stem activities, indoor playground set, a gated baby play area, climbing and jumping‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all there, plus things like board games, color wonder and puzzles in the caf√© seating area - which can also entertain older siblings.

You can make a cup of (complimentary) coffee, grab a seat, and see your child from any vantage point. Snacks are allowed to be brought in and also available for purchase - plus a water station.

While you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôll find ‚ÄúMs. Shay‚Äù sanitizing often - checking in, engaging with the kids, and making it feel more like a community than just an indoor park.

We love visiting here!

What you get with a place like this, as opposed to a chain, is that the owners clearly take pride in their work and are very hands on with everything. Everything is extremely clean and well taken care of, the toys are high quality, engaging and actually fun! The area is thoughtfully laid out to where you will constantly find new things as you walk around, but doesn't feel overwhelming with clutter.
With the party, I came in to decorate with a random box of decorations and Shay (one of the owners) came out to immediately help bring in stuff from my car and helped put up the decorations with me. Honestly, couldn't have done it without her. They make the whole process as easy as possible, they are there to help when needed and you don't have to worry any clean up!
Overall, for parties or just a playdate for the kids, this place is a high quality establishment with extraordinary owners!

Review: We had SO much fun!! This was our first time to go and I took 2 of my kiddos (2 and 3.5) and they had a blast. There was a huge selection of activities for the kids and very clean. I also love that they open EARLY compared to so many other kid activities. 10/10 recommend and we will be back this summer :)

Review: As someone who has been to A LOT of indoor play spaces- I would rate this as one of the best. There is plenty of space for the littles to move around and play safely, but it is small enough that you can sit and watch them play and be able to see them easily. The owners were so friendly and the atmosphere has tons to do without being overstimulating. My 2.5 and 15 month old loved and we will 100% be returning.

The facility had so many different activities and stations set up for independent and creative play. There was a dress up station, salon, grocery store, ball pit, camp site, blocks etc. They have snacks for purchase and great seating for parents. We are so excited to have a play area like this so close to home and look forward to visiting again!

Review: Perfect set up to avoid the heat or cold. Large enough for child to explore with just the right amount of space to oversee their playtime and keep an eye on them. It‚Äôs clean and the ownership takes the time to speak to you and ask your thoughts. Innovative toys, sensory sections, and they also can do birthday parties. Section for parents to monitor is comfortable, and gate entrance once you walk in to ensure your child does not make their way out the door without you. Huge fan and will be adding this place to our list for rainy or really hot days.  Suggest you pre book your play time slot as they do monitor their capacity.

Review: Went to a birthday party on 4/5. Place was absolute chaos. No one checked us and we went right in. No one in charge to see people through the gate. There was about ten adults with sneakers on and no one made them take them off or or put covers over them. Walking around in my socks while they were they with their dirty sneakers. Doesn't make sense. There was no order and kids arriving for the party had no clue they had to check in. Run by little teenagers with walkie talkies who have no idea how to run a small place. Will not go again.

Review: Just recently visited for a birthday party. I love that they have a separate section for toddlers in the front, it was a good way for my 11 month old to acclimate himself. They also had little play pretend areas like a fire truck, a doctors office, a grocery store. Really cool additions!

Everything was great and the kids had tons of fun, except for the fact that it was *extremely HOT* in there! it was like walking into a sauna. we were sweating the whole time, even just sitting and watching the kids play. going outside wouldn't cool us down much either. there just didn't seem to be much air flow going on.

not sure if that's the norm (I'd think not, especially bc it makes me think of the perfect breeding ground for bacteria etc) but that was the only unpleasant thing, so 4 stars! I'm sure we will visit again as my child gets older and more independently mobile.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

I notified the front desk staff they stated they‚Äôve had ants for a while and couldn‚Äôt do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid‚Äôs diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it‚Äôs been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we‚Äôd happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

No meet and greet or making customers feel welcome. Would not take my kids back here again. Basic set up and nothing amazing!

I was surprised they didn't break them on how they were jumping. The staff didn't do anything to inforce rules.
I was very impressed with the size of the party room. I'm not sure if I will be back. But the kids had fun. That's all that mattered.

Review: We made a special trip from Boone down to Hickory which was an hour and 15 minutes one way. but boy oh boy was it ever worth it. my 3-year-old and 7 year old grandchildren have been non-stop playing for the last two and a half hours and neither looks like they're ready to stop. The variety of Hands-On activities, problem solving creative thinking physical toys,  swings, tents even a zipline. opportunities abound for pretend and make believe;  a playhouse,  a kitchen, manipulatives galore. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. The facility is meticulously maintained and clean. My only frustration is that we don't have one of these in Boone of this size and caliber.

I work in the mental health field and I'm well seasoned to these kind of settings. Without a doubt this place had the best staff possible for these kids. My expectations were beyond met. No, my daughter doesn't have autism but it doesn't matter. She had a blast playing with everyone and she didn't want to leave. Five stars without a doubt and I don't usually leave reviews.

Review: This place is way overpriced given the area. I was introduced to this place through one of my child‚Äôs field trip and decided to take my family here only to be closely and physically monitored more than half the time. I do not have any autistic kids by the way. We had a male coworker literally standing close by my kids, even when I was supervising, fixing literally every single thing along as my kids were playing. It was super awkward and uncomfortable to have strangers that close up in you and your child‚Äôs personal space making you feel like you‚Äôre unwanted company. I could not enjoy my time with my kids when I was being watched within a few yards by total strangers or knowing they‚Äôre hawking my kids down. It‚Äôs super weird and it‚Äôs safe to say we won‚Äôt be coming back.

We were the only ones there so got to know Heather who was working at the time. She is so sweet to chat with was gentle and patient with my son who eventually was playing with her and not me.. The play space has pretend play areas and more physical elements like rock climbing and a full sized trampoline. There‚Äôs something for every child here.  Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones trying to find a way to expend their energy.

Review: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: This place was wonderful for a larger space to run and jump and climb on the rainy days! They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

The staff are so genuine, I had amazing interactions with Kyrsten, Francine, Zoie, and Andrew.. made me feel so welcome and at home with their smiling faces. The place is always sanitary and spotless as I see them picking up and cleaning constantly. Perfect place to let kids unwind after school. I will be returning!

Review: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

Review: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed üòâ Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I‚Äôm counting on Francine‚Äôs lattes to see me through!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome üòé... And I'm definitely going back!! üéâ

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.

The space is clean and it‚Äôs got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.
So thankful we found this place.
We will be back üíô

Review: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Their favorite thing was the dinosaur room and the playground. Atmosphere was relaxing was not crowded today. I like that i can bring my own food for them they do have a cafe there as well. 10/10 recommend.

Saturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.

I wish there were more gates around doors here though, I‚Äôve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

Review: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It‚Äôs been hours and he‚Äôs still telling me how upset he is that we left.

There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.
They have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.

Review: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!

Review: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: My wife and I brought our 18month old here on a Saturday and it was a great experience. We decided to bring him again on a Monday the 17th of March. There was blood smearing all over the indoor playground. I advised the worker of this issue. She only cleaned the spots I pointed out at the time. As we continued to play I found numerous obvious spots all over the playground. So, we decided to get off the playground. We proceeded to play downstairs. We where met with a (seemed to be 2yr old, pacifier in mouth) boy. Our son had a baby shopping cart he was pushing around. This other boy grabbed another shopping cart and began to Ram it into my sons. We gently told the boy to be gentle. We removed our son. The boy followed. While our son was playing with something else the unsupervised boy came up to our son and started hitting our son. This is when I intervened and grabbed my boy and left the facility. Don‚Äôt recommend on mondays..

Review: The cutest little place! Perfect for a birthday party or to meet up with other mom friends and let your kids have a blast worry free. They have cameras, so you can still see your kids in the areas that aren't easily to be seen them in directly and a couple of spots to sit down and relax while your kids have fun. My children went to a birthday party just recently (our first time coming here), and they had a blast, and we were able to mingle with the other parents completely worry free. I'd definitely come back again. The only issue is that it's not closer to where I live! Lol

Review: This indoor playground for kids 10 and under opened in May 2019; it's located in a plaza in Avon, CT. I've had it bookmarked for a while and finally was able to check it out. They also host birthday parties. General admission for kids 2 and older is $16.95, adults are free; if they have a sibling under 2, they are also free. I purchased the general admission ticket ($16.95) plus a pre-loaded $16 game bracelet for $26.95.

Shoes are not allowed so socks are recommended. There was a snack area and tables for the parents. Restrooms were clean and had changing tables. The arcade area was small with an air hockey table, photo booth, and various arcade games. My toddler loved the dinosaur egg machine; there were toys inside those golden eggs.

The playground has two levels and they were soft on the feet. The slides were steep but my son loved it; I can see why there's a disclaimer that it goes fast. There was an indoor go-kart track that my son also loved riding the little go-karts on; it went around the playscape. There were large Legos, blocks, a ball pit, a mini ice cream shop, ride on toy cars, and grocery store. We spent an hour and a half there and my son still didn't want to leave. My other son is a crawler, he still enjoyed the toys at the mini stores and the ride on cars. Overall it was 5 stars for my children and I; we look forward to going back and highly recommend it for kids 10 and under.

Review: Hello, I just recently had my daughters 2nd Birthday Party here because my daughter loved going their when I brought her. Not to mention one of my friends Highly recommend it. I was supper excited to have her party their until the day of her party. We had chosen the Deluxe package were it included everything except the cake. Her party was scheduled for 2:30-4:30pm. So when it was time for everyone to eat due to it was only being a 2hr party. I asked the front desk employee who was ALWAYS on her phone at 3:40 when was the pizza coming? And she looked puzzled and finally said it should be here in 20mins. However, I quickly reminded her that our party was about to end soon, so how is that possible? And she said she had to call her boss to ask her where it was because she‚Äôs the one that orders the pizza for the party‚Äôs . It was now 4pm and still no pizza. So the front desk employee said her boss wasn‚Äôt answering and offered me a $50 gift card to the facility in exchange for the pizza not being ordered and I said no I would like it back on my card if not cash. So she gave me money in cash however, it wasn‚Äôt even the full $50 dollars. She either missed counted or didn‚Äôt have enough in her drawer to give me the full $50 dollars. So I reached out to her boss that same day and lettting her know what had happen in regards to the money situation and she said she would refund the rest of the money to my card but that never happend. It‚Äôs been over a week and I have still never received the difference of what her employee didn‚Äôt give me. But not to mention you would think that when someone makes an error of not ordering the main meal for my daughters party which is the  pizza and not fully refunding me for it; as an owner you would apologize but she never did. I mean thank god my family had brought in some small dishes to the party so that way the kids and their family had something to eat rather than nothing. If I had only depended on the pizza being served those kids and their family‚Äôs would have starved! Which would of been embarrassing! I am beyondly disappointed in this company, especially when I‚Äôve always heard good things about this facility which is what made me book with them in the first place. Will I ever return their, most likely not. I found it unacceptable for a owner to not order a pizza for an event she was FULLY aware of in advance and knew she was the only one that orders it; along with not being apologetic not only for the pizza but for the refund as well. If you decide to book your kids party here just as soon as you walk in before paying them the remaining balance make sure the employees and management is willing to do their job first! I do NOT recommend this place for party‚Äôs. It is just not worth it!

Be aware your kids (and you if you plan to join them) need socks, I did not see this on their website anywhere.   Be sure the socks are slip proof. They had socks there but they weren't slip proof and my grandson fell many times and I was close a few times.  I'd hate to see someone get hurt that way.  I would have loved to see maybe a few additional pretend areas but it was still very nice.

- The price is reasonable and free for under 2 years old with older sibling (only pay for older sibling).
- parent can assist their toddler closely.
- don't forget to wear socks - no shoes inside the playground. This is common rules for indoor playground.
- It has cafe but don't sell any coffee for parent. Only drink for kids like smoothie and juice.

Review: BRING SOCKS for yourself and your child.
We went here last summer and then again this summer. I was a bit disappointed this time.
Pros are that the place seems clean. It‚Äôs beautifully decorated. There is a lot to do. There is free WiFi and comfortable seating. You can come and go as you please for a low price. The seating area is a comfortable temperature. There is a camera system that allows the grown ups to see the kids playing.
Cons: When we were purchasing tickets we were told that the arcade and ticket pass was a really good deal by the lady at the desk, so we purchased that package. The arcade only has 9 games. The Virtual reality game was not working last year, and still is not. The games are expensive and give barely any tickets. The prizes for the tickets are priced to high. We were told we could save the tickets to use next time but we are from out of town. They would be better off getting rid of the disappointing arcade and adding more seating. Many times families came in and did not have a place to sit. The snack bar in the lobby has a confusing menu and the snacks are not good. I think they would be better off serving coffee for the parents rather than shaved ice for the kids. The website claims it‚Äôs for 10 and under but my 8 year old daughter seemed far to big for the place. The giant electronic game board was not working. It was just for show. A machine in the other ball pit was not sucking up and spitting out the balls like it was meant to. The bubble machine in the car wash was replaced by fake fluff. They require socks but did not have any for sale. Many families had to walk over to GAP for socks. Despite the air conditioning and fans, the kids play area was extremely hot. All kids would come out red faced and sweaty. We won‚Äôt be going back next summer.
This place seems better suited for kids 3-6 years old without the purchase of arcade as long as you bring your own socks and snacks.

My daughter's favorite part was the interactive ball pit and the slide while my son's favorite part was driving the cars and shopping carts and the guns upstairs. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Even though it's an hour drive for us, we will be coming again!

All the people were friendly, staff and patrons, and the modern touch with RFID bracelets instead of tokens was the only thing that made me feel I hadn't slipped into a time warp to 1992.

Review: Could not recommend this place enough! We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i‚Äôm assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it‚Äôs too hot outside.

I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn‚Äôt even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend! We want to get a membership there now!

There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.

Review: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son ‚Äúwhat was he doing‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hiding‚Äù she then tells my son ‚Äúhe needs to get out because she needs to clean up‚Äù rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone‚Äôs child that way. It‚Äôs a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And ‚Äúget out‚Äù is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after ‚ÄúNana‚Äù says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.

They love coming to play because it‚Äôs a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I‚Äôm not sure why but every time I visit it‚Äôs always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I‚Äôve been to numerous play places all over I‚Äôve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It‚Äôs sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children‚Äôs place and there‚Äôs literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you‚Äôre walking and they‚Äôre flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children‚Äôs place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.

Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.

Review: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.

We arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families‚Äîchildren‚Äôs music, perhaps‚Äîand she said that she didn‚Äôt have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn‚Äôt willing to cut their experience short.

We stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren‚Äôt willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.

The christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.

The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!

Review: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.

Review: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.

Review: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: We reached out ahead of time via email to schedule one morning our preschool homeschool co-op could come. They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!

Review: We loved our experience at sprouts today! It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.

The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: My 2.5 year old loved the place. She got some energy out for sure. The only con is that there isn‚Äôt more stuff to do but it‚Äôs great for smaller kids. The gentleman working the desk was super friendly so not sure where the negative comments came from. I was greeted and explained all the rules. Even got a flyer with their party packages. My baby girl got hurt and the guy even came to make sure she was ok (she thinks she‚Äôs a big kid). Definitely a great environment. 10/10 recommend

Review: Employee at the desk could use some re-training. Dude sat on a chair and on his phone while telling us to scan a QR code to fill out a waiver and at the same time telling us to read the wall for the rules. No meet and greet or making customers feel welcome. Would not take my kids back here again. Basic set up and nothing amazing!

I was surprised they didn't break them on how they were jumping. The staff didn't do anything to inforce rules.
I was very impressed with the size of the party room. I'm not sure if I will be back. But the kids had fun. That's all that mattered.

Review: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if you know to expect it.

Review: We hosted my daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size‚Äînot too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.

Kayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.

One thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don‚Äôt allow this, but here, it made all the difference!

This play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter‚Äôs special day so wonderful!

Review: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.

Review: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.

Review: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.

The staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.

Review: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.
If these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.

Review: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it‚Äôs flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn‚Äôt standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn‚Äôt overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that üòÇ

Overall it‚Äôs a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it‚Äôs worth the money for what they are offering!

Review: We reached out ahead of time via email to schedule one morning our preschool homeschool co-op could come. They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say.

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

Review: This place is amazing. So many things to do. My problem is. To many older kids running to fast in there. I brought my grandson in today. He was excited about everything. Until he wasn't. Not the fault of the other kid  accidents happen. They have this wrecking ball you can swing on. We were getting ready to go in the ball pit they have. The opening to the ball pit is way to close to where the kids can swing. So my 19 month old grandson got hit in the head, by this kid swinging. Plus the kid didn't even say sorry. Parents r supposed to be watching their kids. Like I said it was an accident. But not teaching the kids to say sorry, and not watching your kid as well. But we won't be back for a while unless theyu have age group for kids set up. The owner gave me an ice pack that wasn't even cold. I shared with her what happen and she just kinda said ""O"". Just thought it could be handled better. But again cool place. Just not for the young ones. If you want to run go to the rec centers or to the parks.

Review: Always an absolute blast! This play place is mostly geared toward the younger set. Probably under age 10 but it depends on how much your kid enjoys imaginary play. My four and six year olds absolutely adore it. The play areas change around periodically but there‚Äôs usually a vet center, play kitchen/grocery store, a magic spell booth, puppet show, and a few small games (skee ball, fooseball, basketball) in the back plus a foam pit, small ball pit, trampoline, and a variety of ninja foam blocks to jump and a roller slide and mountain to climb. Also the front area has one of those interactive coloring areas that animates your drawing on a big projector screen. Plus some tables full of building toys. There are plenty of places to sit and chat with other parents while staying within range of your kids. I‚Äôm always impressed with how clean they‚Äôre able to keep it and how chill the vibe usually is. At our last visit they added a new room full of airtoobz machines which kept my four year old busy for most of the play session. They also added a ‚Äúsnowball fight‚Äù area where you could pelt each other with tiny fluffy balls. I ended up in there with both my kids and nephew having the best time. It‚Äôs a really great place to go let your kids have a fun without being overstimulated and blasted in the face with screens and lights and ending the day in a meltdown. It gives wholesome playdate vibes and I just adore it. It‚Äôs really what the children‚Äôs museum in Portsmouth wishes it could be. If you‚Äôre a family with a quiet calm child it‚Äôs amazing. If you‚Äôre a family with a wild animal child climbing the walls and trying to parkour off every surface in your home it‚Äôs amazing. Bring em both. They‚Äôre gonna love it.

The Open Play sessions are held at convenient times. The birthday party set up and experience is seamless and we will be having our twins next birthday here & can‚Äôt wait for all their friends to try it out. The Ninja Warrior class is for ages 6-10, which our kids can‚Äôt attend yet but look forward to signing them up for it. The private rentals are great for daycares, summer camps & school with a reasonable price. The one year anniversary party is coming up next week & my kids are excited to try out the new inflatable balloon bubble house. There is even a black Friday sale of punch cards giving 50% off open play admission, which we will be taking advantage of. Overall, this is a great place to take kids of all ages to have fun & run out some energy. Give it a try, you won‚Äôt regret it! :)

The policy that has parents stay was strange to begin with, but I think the parents had more fun than the kids. Amber, our host, was so helpful and made all the families feel very welcomed.

We brought our own food and decorations. Highly recommend for ages 12 and under. Even my teenagers that were there had fun playing. Lots of make believe, games, and things to climb on. This place could accommodate around 15 kids for the party and it was way better than previous parties at large play places because it was more than just a play ground (in my opinion).

Review: Took my my two children who are under two and one here for some play time and it did not disappoint. The owner was friendly and sweet to both the children and me. She was very involved with all the kids and so loving. The little sections for play are adorable with a little kitchen, tool zone, animal/vet area, police/fire station. The kids loved the slides but the favorite part for every child was the bubble machine ! Those kids loved it paired with music.

Review: Good place to take your rabbits on crack. This location specifically has the much beloved zip line and huge jungle gym.
Only downside is in the back of the whole thing there's a section of the jungle gym that opens up and it's just a couple steps to a drop. Safety concern there, but generally kids are smart enough to avoid it or just get bad vibes.
Oh and their arcade is whack, but you really ain't going there to play with the arcade so no deductions there.

Review: If you‚Äôre curious about having a birthday party here, here are the things you need to know. It‚Äôs lengthy.. sorry üôÉ

Time: We had a birthday party for our son and let me tell you the time frame they give you for the room is NOT worth it. They don‚Äôt serve the pizza until after 30 minutes so you have 45 minutes to get through the pizza, sing hbday, do the cake, & presents, get every body out of the room and get everything packed up and get out of the room yourself. Play time is until they close so that‚Äôs beneficial but you did pay for everyone already so it‚Äôs actually expected.

Food: pizza is from papa John‚Äôs and is very good!

Fees: if you get sick or have an emergency and need to reschedule, they fee you $50. Children get sick all the time so you would think they would be understanding being a kids place but they very much not understanding and do not care at all.
There is also a $75 fee if you go over the party room time for every 5 minutes over. We were all stressing trying to get through everything to be able to get out in time especially since they don‚Äôt let you in early to decorate or set up the food and cake, ect and don‚Äôt serve you immediately either so  you wait 30 minutes before you get the pizzas to eat so you really only have 45 minutes total for everything.

Things included: they say decorations and plates and napkins are included. We received table clothes, a happy birthday sign, and only 10 plates and napkins. The juice boxes are the capri suns and they only give you 10. The reservation is for 10 kids and 15 adults so you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd give you more options or atleast waters for everyone. Good thing there‚Äôs a grocery store near by or the adults will starve and not have anything to drink or eat on because just like us, you will need it to go buy yourself more plates, napkins, cups & drinks.

Viruses/sicknesses: be prepared to get sick if coming. We managed to get the flu the week of our son‚Äôs birthday and had to reschedule. When we reached out to the owners to let them know we were all sick, the options the owners gave us were‚Ä¶
Option 1: keep the date because they said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to lose your $300 this weekend if you don‚Äôt show up‚Äù  Yet, they knew we were all sick with the flu‚Ä¶ and still wanted us to come in so they would ‚Äúlose‚Äù out on our money.. I find it very irresponsible of these owners to sit there and say that to a parent.
Option 2: pay additional fees ontop of our $300 we spent for 1 hour rental of a room. Which really is 45 minutes when you actually get to start eating.

As a parent, we obviously rescheduled and ate the cost because we in no way would want to get the other kids sick and we obviously didn‚Äôt feel well ourselves but to know the owners are willing to send people there knowingly with the flu not caring that it will get all the other kids sick is disgusting.  We usually come every month with friends and family but I think this will be our last time knowing now what we do. They‚Äôre so desperate for an extra $50 they lost a lot more from us in the long term.  We know kids get sick and we try to have fun and be safe but now knowing you‚Äôre intentionally letting people come in sick because you allow people to keep their reservations when they tell you they‚Äôre sick instead of simply rescheduling them to keep everyone safe without fees attached is bad business and it‚Äôs gross.

Review: We celebrated our granddaughters birthday recently.  The kids love safari nation, and it's a very safe, clean play experience for them.
The birthday packages are very expensive and stressful though.  They don't allow you into your party room until 10 mins before the party, which makes it hard to set up, supervise and greet the guests as they arrive.
Thank goodness our pizza arrived on time (we've been to other parties where the pizza is very late), but it still left us rushing through pizza, birthday song, cake, and presents.  You must vacate the room at the end of your time or you will be charged an extra $75.  It was pretty stressful to get everything out in time and I couldn't help but think it stressed the kids too.
Also, they really need things for the adults to do!

Review: I don‚Äôt recommend anyone buy a monthly pass for a child for a birthday present. The date the pass is purchased the pass expires 30 days from that date whether it is used or not. My son‚Äôs Grandfather purchased a monthly pass for him and wasn‚Äôt told that the monthly pass had an expiration date on it before even being used one time. The pass was purchased on 3/30/24. I wasn‚Äôt able to take my son until 4/27/24, so my son lost 27 days from his birthday gift. The worker told me that my son‚Äôs pass would expire on 4/29/24 and if I wanted to purchase another month I could do so. So my son receives a monthly pass for a birthday present and he can only use it for 3 days now because we weren‚Äôt told it needed to be used immediately!!!!

Review: Leaving this place after a friend‚Äôs birthday party with a major headache- and not because of the kids‚Äô chatter- but the unnecessary noise from one of the ‚Äútoys‚Äù in the play area. The volcano makes so much LOUD, unnecessary noise and it goes off constantly so there is no rest from it while watching your kids play. Also the men‚Äôs restroom needed toilet paper while we were there. A friend ended up having to use paper towels to wipe with while there. Not pleasant! Other than these things, the kids had a blast so that‚Äôs a plus.

Its a shame that in this day and time people are saying dont say anything to my kid. When they are doing something that could hurt themselves. Well i guess they will feel better when their child is grown up and they are looking down a barrow of a gun because no one can tell there child anything. Dont get me wrong if it was done in a bad way i would have agreed with him but it wasnt. But before all that the kids have a great time .

Review: I came here with my 2 year old son on a Friday during winter break. We arrived right when they opened and little did we know that the place would soon be taken over by lots of older kids from the Y. All the commotion from all those kids did overwhelm my son at times, but we still managed to have fun. I appreciated how large their 4 and younger section was and there were 2 slide options. I wish there was staff regulating that area a little more as some of the older kids did attempt to play in the area. With the larger playground, there was a good variety of slides and activities. However, there are some areas that need to be fixed as you could see things were falling apart after lots of wear and tear. There is a section where you can shoot soft balls and my son was scared of that noise and it was going off often. I appreciated that you could bring outside food, but not sure why you cannot bring outside drinks. Overall, it can be a hit or miss on how busy it is so you just take that risk when you go. Also it truly depends on your child if they will like that type of environment.

Review: My kid likes it here. They usually avoid opening the zip line. When they do, it seems like the employees are arguing over who's turn it is or isn't to operate it. There's one girl (I should have got her name - not the one always in the hat) that always goes above and beyond to be sweet to the kids when she operates the zipline. If the girl in the hat and the man are there, they don't bother opening it. Instead, they pretend to sweep at the start of every hour. If by the off chance they do open it, it's at 15-20 minutes after and keep it open for 10 or 15 minutes only.

Review: Today was my sons 4th birthday party, and I will never use safari nation again. I called and asked about my reservation and they confirmed that they had the color green wrote down and that I could only have 10 minutes to decorate with my stuff. I also asked when they ordered their pizzas so I could make sure mine was ready at the same time. They told me they would be ready at 2:15, I got there and they literally made me wait till right at 10 minutes to get in the room (I saw other families that got in while the members were cleaning from prior parties) then i get in the room and they didn‚Äôt have any of the green things out. So the 10 minutes I did have pushed me further back, and had my guest watch me set everything up. I was given the room with no instructions. They didn‚Äôt give me the juice boxes till 20 minutes before my party was over and the pizza got there with 30 minutes left in the room. You only get one hour in the room. I‚Äôm thankful I had juice and pizza for the kids or we would have literally been sitting there till half way when the room time  was over. My child‚Äôs name wasn‚Äôt wrote on the door for my guests to even know where to go. There was signs on the table telling me to tip my party attended but I had no attended the whole time- I was even told that an attendant came with my package- I had no one helping the whole time. When I asked about it, they said I had to request one and that no one would really be in there much anyways. The staff were very rude and acted like we were a bother. When you spend almost 400 dollars, I expect so much more. I have had several parties at other facilities, and will definitely use those. It was embarrassing to me, and even some of the people at the party that are members of safari nation. We will not be back.

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: My son is 3 years old and LOVED this indoor play place. The customer service here was great. We are not locals and I was initially confused about which location I had booked for open play. I text the number on the website to confirm the location and the owner immediately called me to direct me to the correct place. My son played for the entire two hours. The swings, climbing walls, and slides were all accessible and appropriate. Shout out to Hunter for ‚Äúracing‚Äù my kid on the slide and making him feel welcomed in the space. This was such a great find during our winter beach vacation as the weather did not permit many outdoor activities. My son was able to get some energy out and had a great nap after a morning filled with fun.

Review: Yesterday was our first visit and our 4yr old son had an incredible time!! I can't say enough good things about the Star Academy! First of all, it was a rainy day for us in Marion and we needed to find something fun for our very energetic toddler. I looked on their website, which is super easy to use and saw they had an Open Play session available from 12-2pm! You have the flexibility of either paying when you book or when you arrive. I appreciate that option very much because sometimes plans change when you have children. We were greeted by the owners, who are absolutely lovely people and were so welcoming! Star Academy is extremely clean and has a very cozy atmosphere. They have so much to offer little ones! I was very impressed with how they maximized the amount of space they have with features like nooks above and below the play areas. My son loved the slides! They offer 2 slides, one that is free standing,  and one twisty slide which is enclosed. The foam block pit was a huge hit!! My son loved jumping in the blocks and building towers with them as well. The owner's 12yr old son, was there and did a phenomenal job with the little ones. He introduced himself and asked them if they would like to build a fort with the foam blocks. He said, the magic word, ""fort"" and my son was so happy to have someone to play with since he's an only child. It's a wonderful space to play with your kids or step back and let them enjoy playing on their own. When my son woke up this morning, he immediately asked if we could go there to play!! The owners offered to make the adults coffee upon arrival and put some snacks out for the kids to enjoy, which is very thoughtful and kind, although my son was too excited and busy to eat anything! They have books, sensory toys and a closer filled with blocks, play dough and sand. Everything was organized, neat and easily accessible for the little ones to explore and choose something to play with in between sliding, swinging, climbing and jumping! We had an amazing day!! Our son didn't want to leave so we purchased an additional 1 hour session. However, I think we will take advantage of the 3 month deal, unlimited play during open play sessions for $188. It was a wonderful experience and a great family outing. We are now a Star Academy family!!

There were amazing tactile toys, mat space, and well designed play areas. The owner was extremely friendly and supportive during our visit. It is more than your normal ""Drop-in to play"" spot and your kids will not want to leave. We visited on the first full day of vacation and we will go back before we leave.  Thanks for creating a safe, colorful, and educational place for little ones in the area (locals and vacationers).

Review: While it‚Äôs a fun place for little kids (I would say like 4 and under), it just wasn‚Äôt for us. My son was as bit by a dog when he was a toddler and has a fear of dogs. While we are trying to overcome that fear, it was hard for him to play. The dog is friendly and was happy as can be, it would have been nice to know prior that there will be a dog running around with the kids. Also the place was smaller than expected. Definitely good for toddlers or younger kids. The place is clean and a very cute set up, just wasn‚Äôt for us.

Review: This place is beyond overpriced. Not to mention the website says it is $22 per child yet we were charged $24. It is a small stripmall office space converted with an indoor play structure. The max age for a child to play should be 4 yrs old. The owner has poor customer service is rude to both the children and parents. Don‚Äôt waste your money and spend that same amount going to a bigger facility with more options and a nicer staff.

Review: My toddler said, ""Yay! I have so much fun!"" üòÜ  It's not your typical assembled plastic jungle gym playspace. It's a well-designed space with quality, wooden play equipment and four different types of swings (my girl's favorite). Owner is very nice & keeps the space clean. My little one can get over-stimulated in a new space with other kiddos, but she did really well there, and there's several cozy nooks she could go to get some zen too if needed.

Review: My daughter has gone here for the past year on and off - she LOVES it. The owner is so personable and you can tell she put everything into making this spot amazing for children. We‚Äôve been a few times right when she had it cleaned and she keeps it that way. We have never had any issues whatsoever and I‚Äôll continue to bring both my children. I recommend this place if you just don‚Äôt know what to do with your kid one day, if it‚Äôs rainy or it it‚Äôs too hot out - they will wear themselves out having a blast.

Review: Absolutely adore this place and the staff really tries so so hard to keep everything organized which is so important when you are responsible for children from all walks- literally the only way to keep everyone safe as well.

Joanna Is so caring. She has literally texted me when I haven‚Äôt shown up with the girls just to ask if we‚Äôre ok or do I need anything because she knows how extremely busy we are since we own multiple businesses ourselves.

I have high anxiety children and they feel safe, respected, secure and loved in her care. We have used Star Academy for birthday parties as well and she‚Äôs learned that even though she will supply everything I still feel the need to bring my own decor and she welcomes it and ask how she can help get it set up. Literally just the best people- they just want to make everyone‚Äôs lives easier and we appreciate this space so much!

Review: I brought my daughter and her friend here today because my oldest daughter was attending a birthday party across the street. From the minute we walked in it was a completely overwhelming experience. The lady running the center immediately barked at us to take our shoes off, was rude about the fact that we hadn‚Äôt paid yet and in between checking us in went on a long diatribe about the center itself. It was honestly too much. Don‚Äôt forget adults can have sensory issues and be overwhelmed as well! I don‚Äôt have a problem taking off my shoes but when you tell me over and over it‚Äôs because you worked so hard to clean the floors all by yourself you made me feel like we were ruining your place. I told you my oldest wasn‚Äôt staying and she said she asked you if she could look around for a few minutes. The minute she started playing with something she barked rudely  again telling me we needed to go ahead and pay for our older kids. I already told her they were on there way out the door. I agree with rules and a place with kids needs to run smoothly but it‚Äôs all in the delivery and how you talk to people I was nervous wreck the whole time. Her ‚Äúassistance‚Äù with the kids was following them around and telling them what to do. We couldn‚Äôt relax we couldn‚Äôt just enjoy for fear the kids were going to mess up her clean room! I gave it a two stars because the girls did have fun, it was clean and a good concept. Just tell the lady running it to calm down . She could learn a thing or two from the sweet lady who ran the butter and whisk party. She was polite, good with the kids, and didn‚Äôt make the adults feel like we were in the way! One last thing if you are going to fuss at everyone to take their shoes off as soon as they come in maybe don‚Äôt have your dog running in and out with dirty paws or your husband come in and not take his shoes off‚Ä¶just saying. My kids and I love dogs but not everyone feels the same. Maybe ask us first if it‚Äôs ok to have your dog running around! Respect goes both ways!We will not be back I felt awful the whole time we were there .

Joanne is AMAZING, she catered to our every need & even decorated so we didn‚Äôt have to stress about it. She also took tons of pictures so we could enjoy the time with our son.

Review: Outrageously upset about the fact that Little bees indoor playground was extremely perfect for my four year old toddler. I was looking for somewhere to take him to release all his pent up energy.! (Too cold and wet for the playgrounds). Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny.. Ideal place to stop by if you have children that love imaginative and interactive playtime!

Ps. I will be back day after day

Review: My friend and I visited each with 3 kids 4 and younger. It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue ""Elsa"" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!

My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.

Review: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that‚Äôs intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out‚Ä¶. I walked away‚Ä¶ about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife‚Äôs mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn‚Äôt melt. All this to say, if you don‚Äôt pay the 200$ for a party, don‚Äôt take any food or drinks‚Ä¶and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don‚Äôt ask if you can bring anything in‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably get talked about like your a criminal‚Ä¶ total of 150$ spent here.

Review: They have some games to play and plenty of space for the kiddos to play and run and bounce out their energy! Lots of obstacles and levels to play in, a slide from the top level of the play / climbing area.
Went today and they have rearranged the kids play area some which opened the play area up some.

Review: Updated review - 5/22/25

First time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn‚Äôt help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn‚Äôt put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.

Then wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn‚Äôt wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm super clean I can‚Äôt let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!

Then I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!

Would I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn‚Äôt happy

That broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent

Review: The worst of the places to celebrate birthdays, I feel cheated, I paid a lot of money only for 2 pizzas, a couple of juices, a poor table and a decoration of the worst and to they liking, the bracelets are useless you can't play on the machines even paying for a birthday party, they don't have music, they don't make the birthday boy happy, they don't do anything to celebrate a birthday in that place. Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.

Review: We've been coming to this establishment for years! We love this place. The staff are amazing. The manager here is very professional. She makes sure the children feel safe at all times! If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!

Review: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.

Review: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.
They had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.

Review: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The ‚Äútoddler area‚Äù gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn‚Äôt get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you‚Äôre going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.

Review: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.

Review: If they had a zero I‚Äôd leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don‚Äôt fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don‚Äôt even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn‚Äôt let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I‚Äôm another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don‚Äôt tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you‚Äôre business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up

Review: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back üòä

The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It‚Äôs not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.

Review: Really wanted to like this place - it's decorated really cute and has lots of fun things for kids to do. However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.

Review: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn‚Äôt expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol
This was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.

Review: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù event‚Ä¶ this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter‚Äôs wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to ‚Äúsit down and have a special snack‚Äù that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn‚Äôt tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren‚Äôt even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.

Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don‚Äôt know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn‚Äôt take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn‚Äôt have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.

Review: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the ""reserved"" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the ""manager"" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.

Review: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.

Review: We went here a week ago to see what it was all about and if it'd be a good place to do our kids birthday party at. We loved it and the same day we booked a party slot for next month! We have a couple play dates set up to meet up here as well, it's so worth it!

Review: Website says use there socks. Get there no one is doing this. Go to buy socks for my 14 month old and they charge me and can see he is little bitty. Shows me the socks and says this is all I have and the size was like a 2 to 4 year old size. Oh we can't give refunds she says. Many repairs need to be done in the building. Lots of trim pieces and floor pieces missing or falling off all over. I would drive to another location over this one next time but was there for a birthday party

Review: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews‚Ä¶What you see is what you get in their pictures‚Ä¶Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I‚Äôve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents

Place is priced perfect‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the biggest but it‚Äôs not for older kids‚Ä¶The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It‚Äôs injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry‚Ä¶

The food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven‚Äôt seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child‚Ä¶

It feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more‚Ä¶they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms

They were both incredibly exhausted after, which meant a great nap. It also looked like a fun place for a birthday party, with 2 private party rooms.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Review: This was our first time here and we really liked it! There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He‚Äôs still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It‚Äôs was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We‚Äôll definitely be back!

My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid‚Äôs diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.

Only comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It‚Äôs a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it‚Äôs been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we‚Äôd happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid‚Äôs diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it‚Äôs been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we‚Äôd happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: I don't give reviews but I visited Playcious a while ago and it has slowly become a favourite spot for me and my daughter! We live close yet we've never been here, but one of my friends who is a regular said it was ‚Äúbetter than SkyZone,‚Äù so we gave it a try and are now slowly also becoming regulars!

The kids had a lot of fun with the 2 HR Value pass, and even us adults managed to have fun too, especially with the car racing and arcade games! I also like how the little kids have their own trampoline area, especially with staff keeping it that way, which was not easy on the Saturday with all the rush. The place is also CLEAN! As a clean freak i was impressed with how maintained everything was, especially the washrooms, there was no bad smell which is NOT a usual at like most places.

The main reason for this review is a staff member, I asked but forgot her name (i just remember its start with K and hijab) but, what happened was that my daughter was getting scared on the wall climbing and kept wanting to come down, yet also wanting to go up as it was like her first time.Now usually most get annoyed and just let the kid leave, but she didnt do that. I guess she noticed that my daughter really wanted to do it(I also was insisting that she do it) except was scared, so instead of like ""getting over with it"" she kept encouraging my daughter by telling her how she was so brave and just being very understanding. As a parent, I appreciated it a lot as she was patient, like not frustrated or in a hurry and just genuinely helped my daughter have fun! I really do recommend this place to other parents!

Review: The facilities are great for kids and adults that come with them. The coordinating of the event is great and very helpful for the busy parent. The add one offered are great and really helpful with making the party great
Things that made the event non pleasant: the place is limited to the time of the party...you cannot stay after the event is over for the kids to play. More to that is that the employees made mistake with bracelets and the timing on them and didn't validate their error. Kept coming to guests and asking them to leave.
Also if you would like a review from people please don't shove the Google sign in the face of the party organizers asking for review. I had the sign of Google put in my face three time during the party, with last time being by the front desk employee who clearly expected me to fill the Google review here and now, while my hands are full with party related items to be carried out to the car.

Review: There were several boys aged 7 or 8 at the slide area. They didn't care about the children sliding down and just rushed up from the bottom. They knocked down the children sliding down very hard. I reported this incident to the boss, but he didn't handle it and allowed such dangerous things to happen. The experience was very bad. I won't come again. A playground that doesn't even care about safety incidents.

Review: We love coming here especially since they opens up the bigger location across the street from the original one. They have mini golf outside, and a whole indoor playground for the kids. This spot is a great spot to bring the kids and let them run and play and have fun.  They absolutely love it. You can stay here for hours. The concessions are ok and fairly reasonably priced. The equipment is next level and a real gem in the area. If you‚Äôre traveling through it‚Äôs a nice spot to take a couple of hairs detour through, but mainly I‚Äôve seen that it‚Äôs more of a destination spot.

Review: OH MY GOODNESS!!! I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was better than anything I could have dreamed. For my crew of little humans (4 of them) it was a 2 hour drive. Worth EVERY mile. My kids range from 10 to 2 and my 4 y/o has profound autism, every one of them had a blast!! If your littles have any sensory issues the music might be just a tad loud but once you get into the play area all the foam (padding) muffles it down nicely. This place is truly for everyone, big kids, little kids, awkward in-between kids, special kids, and adults who are kids at heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. We will definitely be coming back (I wish tomorrow), and would not hesitate to recommend this place to EVERYONE. Best money I've spent this year. Thank you Kidvsille.

Review: We LOVE kidsville! Hours and hours of fun for super cheap. I have a crawler and a 5 year old. Both have a blast. Love that the baby has her own area to play in but she can also climb most everywhere else in the gym. I was a little disappointed in the cleanliness with our last visit. I know it‚Äôs hard to keep a kid area clean! It‚Äôs need a really good vacuuming. There was a wall with broken pieces that wasn‚Äôt cleaned up either and it was definitely a choking hazard for littles. We still love this place though! We will be back. I hope the cleanliness improves though!

And I hope the rules change on outside food. For those who have food allergies, they can‚Äôt eat there and you can‚Äôt leave the building to eat in your car and come back in.

There was a line forming for one of the bathrooms because the second one isn't marked well and people didn't realize it was a bathroom. One more Restroom sign over the second bathroom would do the trick.

My biggest complaint is kiddsville doesnt seem to back the toys they sell. I bought my son a stretchy food set for his birthday that broke within 5 minutes of playing. I called and was told since I couldnt bring the toy back to email a person about a refund I sent emails and continue to be ignored.

Review: I took my 16 month old son here today for some fun. We were excited to see the new facility and was hoping to have a good time. While he was playing and having a good time on the peg wall an older boy decided to shove my baby to the ground because he was taking the pegs off the wall. This was completely unacceptable and the parent didn‚Äôt see this happen for some reason. I‚Äôm sorry but in a place like this children should not be left unattended because my son could have gotten hurt by this significantly older boy in the toddler area. I was thankfully within arms reach of my son the whole time. I unfortunately won‚Äôt be back.

There's a lot of climbing if you want to experience each section of the playground. Don't forget to wear socks if you plan on playing. There's a nice cafe' section with cameras of the playground if you want to sit and relax while your kids play.

Review: Great place to kick back and let the kids play. Reasonably priced for one adult, unsure however why they feel they need to charge when both parents want to hang out and watch. It almost feels like they would prefer less people buy their concessions and to also appear less busy. From a marketing perspective it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I digress...

It's a good spot, would definitely recommend.

Review: An amazing place to take your young ones. This place was even fun for me to get in there and chase my son around. It did get extremely warm in there, you could tell the A/C wasn't on and my son was sweaty fir the majority of our time there. So even if it's cold outside dress the kiddies down once they are inside or they will over heat lol. They had a Little soccer/basketball area that was the highlight of the trip there. It seemed pretty clean but I didn't not see staff go around and wipe things down. I would've liked to have seen that. Kids were drooling, sticking their mouths on everything in there haha kids will be kids. Mad fun we will be back!

I would love to leave more stars, but during our most recent visit we were told that our ‚Äúday pass‚Äù we purchased was only good if we stayed in the parking lot. We had gone back to our relatives‚Äô house to allow our 2 year old to nap. This policy was not communicated when we made our purchase, and even though we presented our receipt, we had to pay for two day passes for one child. This policy should be changed or it should be clearly communicated to everyone upon purchase.

These require COINS - so make sure to have toonies and loonies with you. Outside food is allowed so you can comfortably feed your kid with whatever healthy/special diet/kosher food you bring with you. Local cafe is also available.
A good place to spend a few hours on a rainy day :)

Review: This place could use a lot of improvements in terms of maintenance. There were enough options for children under 2 to play. The older kids also didn't have many options  beyond the main climbing area. The food/snacks options were limited as well for parents and kids. The staff was OK. They didn't have something as basic as bathroom slippers since the place didn't allow shoes(which is great). We had to manage without going to bathroom for 3-4 hours because we are just to comfortable using public washroom in our socks.

We recently celebrated my son's 5th birthday at Funtastic Forest, and it was a fantastic experience! This indoor playground is fun, cozy, and super safe‚Äîperfect for kids aged 2-9.

üéâ Why we loved it:
‚úÖ Exciting play area ‚Äì Levels of climbing structures, slides, tubes and mats kept the kids entertained for hours.
‚úÖ Friendly & attentive Staff ‚Äì Specially Vern went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. The service was outstanding!
‚úÖ Clean & well-organized ‚Äì The entire space was spotless, which is a huge plus for parents.
‚úÖ Relaxed atmosphere ‚Äì Not overcrowded, allowing for a stress-free experience.
‚úÖ Safe play area ‚Äì Parents can relax while kids have fun.
‚úÖ Great value ‚Äì Various party packages to fit different budgets.

‚òï Bonus Perks:
The coffee at the snack bar is surprisingly good!
You can bring your own decorations, food and cake to personalize your party space.

If you‚Äôre looking for a stress-free, fun-filled experience for your child‚Äôs party or just a weekend activity, I highly recommend Funtastic Forest! We had an amazing time and will definitely be back.

Review: I visited there with my child, and unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt a good experience. Some part of the floor is made of hard ceramic tiles, which I found to be slippery. My child slipped and hit his head on the ground, which was extremely concerning.I saw a girl fall off the machines too. The choice of flooring is unsafe, especially for younger kids who are more prone to falls. I‚Äôd strongly recommend that the flooring be replaced with a more child-friendly material like rubber or soft matting to prevent injuries.I would never go there again though.

The entire establishment is big and spacious with lots of space for kids to run and move around.
They have multiple seating areas and an eating area aswell. They have a few machines that uses coins like loonies and toonies.
The washroom was clean and no lingering pee smell.
They have a concession area where you can buy coffee tea and small snacks.
SOCKS ONLY establishment.
we loved that we were able to use our own. We did have a plus one, so we paid for that entrance fee and bought a pair of socks, as they do have socks for sale in case you do need a pair.
Free parking.
parking space was decent.

The indoor gym itself is pretty nice and organized there is a small area for kids from 12 months to 3 years old, and well organized aswell.
The gym has 3 levels the kids can go from one section to another by a bridge the mats on the floor in some areas need to fixed and address.
Other then that its a well kept area

I think you can bring your own food too which is a huge help. Small Cafe there if you want to buy coffee or a snack. The price is great, in ottawa it's 22.99 per kid plus 14.99 for a parent. Here it was 15$ after tax for me and my son. Able to crawl around the spaces if you need to supervise your little one. Wear comfy clothes

Review: This is an excellent place to host a kid's birthday party! We celebrated my daughter's 3rd bday here but all children aged 2-10 were having a blast! Three floors of climbing structures with slides, tubes and colourful soft mats spanning the width of the play place make it an attractive and fun place for kids to play till they're exhausted, while parents sit and enjoy a coffee or lunch at the little snack bar. For my daughter's bday I was worried about not having time to decorate but the hall had the party room so nicely set up with a big board saying ""happy birthday --"" (with her name on it) and all we ended up having time to bring were helium balloons, and it was perfect! We brought our own cake and everything else was provided in our package. It was awesome being able to go home after without a ton of things to clean, sort and put away. Vern and his awesome staff took care of everything and we were free to enjoy our time with our friends!

Review: It can be very challenging to find a great play place for a birthday. Funtastic forest is a 10/10. Very spacious (no blind spots), very clean, a variety of gross motor activities for children and the staff is very professional and hard working-especially the owner. Funtastic Forest has a variety of packages that make planning easy for families-leaving us with little to do. Each time I‚Äôve had a party here, families have raved about the fun experience they have encounter-leaving them to return again-I have been to other play places to celebrate birthdays and Funtastic forest by far takes the cake!!! I highly recommend this place and will 100 percent be returning for my children‚Äôs birthdays. What a great team!!!!

Review: I can't express how much Funtastic Forest exceeded our expectations and provided the perfect place for my daughter's 5th birthday!  The kids absolutely loved it and so did I!  The playground provides endless fun.  Most kids said it was the best play place and party they had been to!  I can't thank Vern and his team enough for the exceptional service they provided.  He went above and beyond to ensure we could provide the best party possible.  He  was amenable and compromising because he understands how important it is for any parent.  Thank you so much, it really was a phenomenal experience.  As most people have commented the facility is very clean and well maintained.  I'm also very appreciative to Vern for being so accommodating with my walker-bound mother, thank you.  We can't wait to come again!

Review: Kids (3.5yrs old) had a blast.
Safe for then to go unaccompanied, enough space for a non claustrophobic adult to squeeze through with them if needed as well.
Has a snack stand and clean bathrooms on site.
Has some arcade style rides that require additional money, didn't see a change machine but I imagine snack stand could accommodate.

Review: Without hesitation I'd recommend the FUNtastic Forest to anyone looking for safe and incredibly fun entertainment for their children.  My review is based on hosting my son's last two birthday parties here at ages 2 and 3.  Some of the highlights I can share are:

- The staff are friendly, helpful, and professional.  The owner Vern is a great guy.  He was very accommodating and easy to deal with in the planning of our parties.
- The entire facility is well maintained and is very clean throughout from the playgrounds to the washrooms.
- The amenities for the kids are so good! My kids and their friends loved the toddler area as well as the big slide! There are multiple playgrounds with a main corridor that is spacious.
- There's a nice coffee bar for parents/adults, plenty of seating in the front area, and comfortable massage chairs.
- The party rooms are very nice and have tables, countertops, and seating.
- Lots of parking out front and easy to find location.
- Indoor air quality and temperature were perfect.
- Safety and security measures were nice to see such as the staff controlling who enters and maintaining a list of people in the facility.
- Pricing is very affordable and fair.

No negatives at all.  We'll definitely book here again!  Thanks so  much!

There is an area for toddler which was a hit. Along with an air hockey tables which the pre-teen at my party used the entire time. The staff was super nice and very attentive. They order pizza from pizza nova and are very flexible with you bring your own food. I would highly recommend having a kids party here or even just visiting for your kids to burn off energy! Very happy and impresses with FUNtastic Forest. Everyone had a blast!

Management was incredibly accomodating and flexible, working with us to ensure the party turned out like we wanted it to! The team was helpful with setup and clean up. The place was clean, well kept, big, safe, bright and a lot of fun for the kids! Something for everyone - infants? Toddlers and big kids! The kids had a blast and did not want to leave! There was so much for them to do and enjoy!!

Review: We visited for the first time today with my daughter (almost 2). The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the ‚Äúcurb appeal‚Äù of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I like this place and my daughter does too but the only bad thing is the kids menu like others mentioned there‚Äôs lil to no food for them only some snacks and you can‚Äôt bring in food.  So if you can‚Äôt bring food in have better options. Everytime we go there there‚Äôs only one thing food wise available for the kids the full menu is never available, according to the people working.

I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it‚Äôs very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

Review: My 4 year old loves it here, we've been for a few years and came again today. Was just thrown off a little as a table of guests brought in some horrid smelling takeout (squids/ fish and what not) they ate it throughout the playplace and played with toys while carrying some food on forks and in their hand. A few of the staff watched and said nothing, I'm sure I've read no outside food allowed. The smell alone was off putting and I'm sure disrupting the tables around them, never mind the bags of other items they had. We've never been on a weekend and it was nice to see so many kids!

Review: We‚Äôve been to Tiny Town dozens of times, and it never gets old. My son insists on wearing their tiny penguin outfit every visit because, in his words, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfancy vacation‚Äù and feels like stepping into a brand-new city - apparentl, every vacation deserves a penguin suit?!? The staff do a great job keeping things organized, even with all the moving pieces‚Äîit can get a little out of sorts, but that‚Äôs part of the fun.
Let‚Äôs talk about the real hidden gem: the bathrooms, which are always spotless. You could walk in with just socks and not think twice (though they do provide slides if you‚Äôre feeling fancy). Always a great time.

AND of course I forgot a stand for my cupcakes and was given one to borrow which was amazing. I was very grateful. Everyone had such a great time all of the kids loved it. The balloons were wonderful, exactly what I was looking for, the play areas were all so cool and fun. The entire place was spotless upon arrival which I greatly appreciate, bathrooms were spotless also. The entire experience was exceptional. Would highly recommend!

Overall this little town is charming. Old school charm with new age toys. Excellent for younger children. I brought my 6 year old and 9 year old. Although my 9 year old had fun, she definitely mentioned to me how ""old"" she felt playing here.
I found the place disorganized despite the staff constantly trying to clean up after the kids. It's definitely a challenge at all these types of places to have enough toys for all kids, especially when some kids ""hoard/hog"" the toys for themselves and their parents don't intervene with ""sharing"" concepts. It's something kids just have to deal with.

Review: This is a cute idea for a kids play place, pretty well executed. I thought the incorporation of things like jumbo building blocks and toy vehicles into the ‚Äúmake believe you‚Äôre in a tiny town‚Äù theme was a nice touch, and it meant that my two-year old, who isn‚Äôt much interested in imaginative play yet, could still have a great time. I also appreciated the infant area.

My major complaint is that the ‚Äúno-outside-food‚Äù policy is unnecessary and makes me unlikely to come here frequently. There‚Äôs a well-defined area for eating, and there‚Äôs no reason a family couldn‚Äôt enjoy a packed lunch there, so I assume the idea is to force me to spend more money at their cafe. But when I saw that the cafe was basically only offering fast food and empty calorie snacks I became pretty unexcited about that option. Small children are notoriously picky eaters as well as frequent snackers. So, when a business specifically aimed at children intentionally frustrates our eating routines just to shake another $5 out of me for a greasy slice of pizza, it‚Äôs a huge turn-off.

Review: Smaller business, but decent space for small gatherings. Parking availability is okay, but toys are older and visibly wearing out.
I understand outside food won‚Äôt be allowed in places like these, but $2.54 for a bottle of water (500ml) from Costco is a little too harsh for the buyers inside.
Adults paying for their presence inside again because they have to wait, and entering their names date of birth etc for that is a little too many questions asked.
Overall, I would not possibly come back.

Review: Love the idea of Tiny Town, hate the administration.

The concept behind this place is great. It's a large space where kids can play dress up and make believe in various places in town. My kid loves it. However, as a parent, this place is a nightmare.

1) It's always crowded. This may be a zoning issue where the City has licensed them for people than the facility should hold. Sometimes it's so crowded, kids can't enjoy themselves without fighting and trampling over each other.

2) The staff here are always rude. I don't know why, regardless of when you go or how you contact them (phone or email), they're not helpful.

3) The cleanliness of this place is questionable.

Review: This is a cute place but could definitely use some improvements. I find it difficult for kids to play. For example, when I arrived, all of the shopping carts and food from the grocery store were in other areas throughout the town. I spent a lot of time cleaning up so that my child could play.  There was only one staff member who was scrambling to tidy up each room. I think limiting the number of families for a time slot could improve the experience. Most of the wooden Melissa & Doug toys have a lot of wear which is understandable as the toys have been handled by so many. Definitely a bit chaotic for my organized family.

Review: We visited Tiny Town today (Saturday at 9:00 am) and had a great time. Our son is 16 months old and really enjoyed exploring the various curated rooms and the space itself. It‚Äôs thoughtfully designed with each room having a theme, and toys/items that go along with it. He spent most of his time in the animal/vet and flower/grocery shop rooms.

They have staff there going around and returning items and toys that have been left out, so it‚Äôs well maintained. It was clean and we really liked the no shoe policy.

The only drawback was that it got extremely busy about 40 minutes after opening (it was a Saturday morning so to be expected), and there were a lot of older children just running around.

Overall, we had a good time and we‚Äôll be back to play again!

Review: Went due to postive reviews. Only one staff member at the front that also runs the limited food stop, e.g. microwaved pizza. Most of the parents don't watch their kids. The kids don't clean up after themselves and are grabbing stuff from other kids or just throwing toys around, so toys are in different rooms. My kiddo likes organization so we ended up tidying up after the other kids. A fair amount of broken stuff, e.g. baby strollers and cars, and for how long they've been in business, I don't think most of the stuff was purchased new as there is significant wear and tear.

Some of the kids stuff is on the low end, e.g. the cheaper kids kitchens. Kids aren't washing their hands after using the bathroom but that's not on the facility. There is signage to use hand sanitizer but the wall mounted one isn't just finished, it has nothing inside. There was also a coughing kid that was touching everything. Surprised they didn't tell them to come back when they're not sick.

Overall, we just made sure we all washed our hands after.

Review: Word of advice, read the 1 star reviews before you decide to have a party here because you will experience much of the frustrations that a lot of people are sharing here. Despite these comments, the owner doesn't make any effort to improve customers' experience.
I have been a long-time customer of this establishmen. However,  during a recent conflict they showed their true colours. The management lacks conflict resolution skills and don't really care about the issues you raise to them, insisting their positions and then tend to gaslight you. They are rude, and instead of having an open discussion, they prefer you go away and they hung up on me on the first point of contact. Even though they say they welcome constructive criticism and honest feedback!! Please note I wasn't even asking for compensation. However, their rude and dismissive attitude was absolutely reflecting of these comments here. It's very disappointing and be assured that I will never recommend this place to anyone.

They have coffee, tea, and snacks. They do serve fast food. Also, drinks for the littles.
I don't like the wide age range allowance. I think it should be only for Infant-8 years old.

Review: We recently celebrated our son‚Äôs first birthday at Tiny Town Vaughan. We rented the venue exclusively for our guests which made it super comfortable for both the children and adults that joined our celebration. We had children from all ages between 1-14yrs and they all had a great time. The older children engaged in dress-up play with the younger children. The adults enjoyed themselves as well, knowing they could allow their children to roam and explore freely in a safe and clean space that was exclusively for our guests. Amanda (Red) did an excellent job setting up a beautiful party room and ensuring all went smoothly throughout the evening‚Ä¶ she truly went above and beyond! Amanda (Red) and Amanda were both extremely helpful prior to the party, helping me coordinate a perfect event. Diana, the owner of Tiny Town, also owns Caledon Ballons and created the beautiful ballon decor for our party. The Ballons still look gorgeous weeks later! We also kept the coffee bar open for our guests which seemed to be a hit! All in all, it was a perfect venue for our son‚Äôs first birthday celebration. The space accommodated our 75 guests of all ages comfortably and everyone had a great time. It is a wonderful space to host a child‚Äôs birthday party of this grandeur.

Review: Cute little play place that we attended for a birthday party. It was great for kids of all ages. There are different rooms with activities and costumes, a road with vehicles to drive, and a construction area. Each room represents a different building in the town (restaurant, salon, grocery store, etc). There is also an infant area with toys and activities for babies under 1 to play with. Just beside the play rooms there are tables and chairs for parents to sit at while their kids play. The bathrooms were big and clean. Diaper changing stations for baby, potty seats and a step stool at the sink are available and so convenient. No strollers are allowed in the play area, we left ours in the coat room. Everyone must wear socks (adults too). We attended for a private event, but there is also a drop-in play option. For drop ins there is a snack bar where snacks and refreshments can be purchased. There are 3 party rooms available. Parking is free outside the building and everything is on the main level. I will definitely be back with my kids .

-spacious washrooms
-amazing detail to each store / room, but I would say some toys were pretty worn
-spacious party rooms and play areas, even though it was a little busy we still had room to play
-discounted open bar coffee since we had a party booked
And more good things
The ONLY reason I have to dock a star is because the security. There is no gate or any sense of security, so anyone could pick up a child and walk out with them. There should be a gate, or wristband system, or security who will make sure every child who walks out is walking out with the right people. Of course parents should always watch their kids, but there should definitely be another layer of protection since there's lots of small children. Other than that great experience :)

Review: I was interested in bringing my toddler and baby here to see if it was worth all the hype. While it was suitable for both of their age ranges, I found it very chaotic and overwhelming. There were big messes in every room, and it was a bit overstimulating for my toddler.

I encountered many staff members that are extremely friendly, courteous Thant make both parents and children feel comfortable. The most recent encounter was with both Amanda and Vince. The place is well kept and clean. They have thought of everything to make you feel at home and comfortable. It is definitely a place we will be visiting frequently. Thank you to all!

Review: We had a great experience at Tiny town. I read some of the reviews and decided it was best to go in the morning, right when they opened. It was great. My daughter had so much fun she did not want to leave. The place was clean, it was not busy so my daughter had lots of space to go from room to room. It started to get busy around 10:30am.

Bathrooms were clean, staff were friendly. I have no complaints and will be visiting again.

Review: Had a birthday party here. Staff had no service. If you go after 4pm the toys will be everywhere on the ground except where they belong to, because nobody put them back. They let way too many kids in during weekends so overall experiene was not good. I doubt if they every clean the toys. Lots of them already feel sticky. Should have just had the party at home. Dont waste your money here.
My daughter started having a fever after the party, hightly likely due to the crowds (one kid threw up there) and dirty toys.

Review: Here right now for the first time with three kids. We came from Fairfax because we got summer reading coupons from our public library for this place. We‚Äôre having a wonderful time. Large, clean, spacious, and something for children of all ages. Everything is winter themed. Nice temp controlled place to play during very hot/cold weather  There are separated areas for 0-2s and 2-7s, birthday party rooms, bathrooms, and a lot more. There are bar chairs, high table tops, and soft benches for adults. The staff was very kind and professional. The price includes unlimited play time.  You need to wear socks to enter (they sell them too). Looking forward to coming back!

Hyper Kidz was the perfect spot to take them with age appropriate play areas, lots of friendly staff protecting the 2 and under area from big kids. The whole place, including the bathrooms, were super clean. Also loved that I paid in the morning and was able to come back after lunch and nap time as long as we kept our bracelets on! $23 total for a full day of tot entertain!

We were there when it opened and it got a bit crowded by the time we left at noon, but it was fun, safe, and a great way to beat the heat ü•µ
AC was nice and cool and they let you bring in your kid's snacks and food which was really nice. They even have little counter seating so you can still watch the kids play and work on a laptop or eat a meal. We will definitely be back.

It is very clean, feels super safe and secure. Gets crowded in the weekends but is very manageable in weekdays, even in the evening. My almost 2 year old likes it too and they have a nice separate area for babies, but he likes to wander to the big kid area so it‚Äôs a lot more chasing with him. Highly recommend!

It‚Äôs clean, enclosed, parents and kids wear matching wrist bands, and the music isn‚Äôt blasting amassing to the general cacophony of kids having fun. It won‚Äôt break the bank and your kids can play all day for a flat fee. All in all, much better than typical indoor playgrounds.

Review: Yesterday afternoon my husband took my kids to this location and my son got hit in the face because another child didn‚Äôt want to play with him. The parents stepped out of the building leaving him in there unattended. While the assistant manager offered to file an incident report that wouldn‚Äôt rectify the situation took place. The only solution was if my son got hit again or the boy hit someone again he would be asked to leave. This picture is my sons face today and he‚Äôs emotional go out no because he got hit in the face. I feel like this is unacceptable and the child should be removed immediately after assaulting another child and leaving marks on their face.
