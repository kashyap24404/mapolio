Review: My son had his second birthday party here and it was perfect!!! We had 30 adults and 23 children and it fit perfectly !!! We did the ultimate package and it was well worth it! The company is family owned and they were amazing to work with. The establishment was very clean and there was plenty of parking. I highly recommend this place for a fun day with your kids or to have a kids party!! Even the pizza they had was so delicious!

Review: My family and I celebrated My daughter’s second birthday here. From beginning to end it was such a smooth process and really made my job a lot easier as far as prep work went. Miss Michelle and the rest of the staff were amazing! The package I purchased included a theme of my choice, them setting everything up for the party all decorations, paper plates, etc. included! Afterwards, they cleaned everything up for me which gave me a lot more time to be able to just enjoy the party and my baby. I am so grateful for this place and the wonderful people who own it, and I hope that they stay in business forever! I would also like to add that it was very clean. It smelt clean upon entrance, which also made me feel a whole lot better for my baby and the other kiddos that were playing truly a great place to have a party. If you have a toddler, they will be extremely entertained, and the parents can even take a seat on the sofa and relax as they watch the kids play!

Review: My children’s first time today and will never go back. It was time to leave and one of my kids doesn’t want to leave, and I was alone with 3 kids (one is infant), so I was trying to carry the two, but the kid of mine who’s is crying were able to go back inside the play area, I told the lady that I’ll be back to get him because I had to drop my other children’s off in our car. So when I got back, an old lady grabbed my child to the exit door (like the play area door) I said I got it. I just don’t like how she grabbed my son like that and literally to kick him out just because there’s a party coming by the time they close. Idk who she is. But I don’t like what she did. I said I’ll be back and I did. Good thing my other kids are left in the car for a minute or else I’m gonna be there to confront her why she grabbed my son literally to the door SMH lady let me do it, don’t touch my child. Besides, I already noticed that most of the educational music toys doesn’t work, it doesn’t have even batteries. What’s up with that SMH. Toys are old it’s not that it’s dirty because it’s already end of the day, it’ doesn’t work

Review: Fidgets is a small playground that my daughter and I have been frequenting for the past two years. Whenever I need a moment of relaxation and she needs some playtime, we know exactly where to go!

One of the things that I truly appreciate about Fidgets is the sense of safety it provides for my daughter. The playground is just the right size - not too big - allowing me to always have a clear view and hear her voice from across the room. It brings me peace of mind.

Moreover, Fidgets is equipped with a variety of toys suitable for kids of all ages, ranging from 1 to 6 or 7 years old. It ensures that every child's play needs are met. Additionally, I find the place to be consistently clean, which is a huge plus for me as a parent. The staff members are always friendly and welcoming, making our visits even more enjoyable.

I wanted to reach out and share my positive experience with you. If you're ever in need of a safe and fun environment for your child, I highly recommend checking out  Fidgets. I'm confident you'll have a similar experience.

Review: Reasonably priced and well maintained play place.

We first visited 5 months ago, and our grandson requested a return visit.

It's a nice place to allow ones child to play freely and still be in view.

The place is on the smaller side compared to many other places, yet this is a bonus, especially for young children between the ages of one and three. Older kids might not find it challenging enough, yet for younger children, it's the perfect place to mingle, learn to share and play with other children.

Review: We hosted a dual birthday here for 2nd and 4th Birthday for our Daughter and son. We had to pick 1 theme (they provide plates and some decorations) so we went with Encanto. For our son we brought some of our own decorations and they had no issue with that.

They have packages that include pizza and drinks as well as either face painting or a character that comes to entertain the kids, we chose the face painting and it was a huge hit!

It’s also nice they have early time slots for party (I think we chose 10am-12pm) reservations as I find with small kids it’s usually easier to get things done in the morning before they get sleepy and cranky.

The playground is clean and the service was great.

One thing to remember is bring your own socks! Adults and kids have to wear socks no shoes allowed inside but if you forget them they are available for purchase at the front.

Popular play items for my kids are the ball pit and the train they can ride around! There’s also dress up that my daughter really loves!

We also come here regularly just to play, my kids love it

Review: Fidgets is a great (and the most affordable) place to have an indoor party! We had our daughter's 2nd birthday here and it was a blast! The toys are all age appropriate and the climbing structure was fun for older kids at the party. It was clean and spacious and I liked that no shoes were allowed. We did the Mickey and Friends theme and the decorations were amazing and it was so lovely to not have to decorate or clean up. Michelle was so friendly and helpful during planning and the party as well. We would definitely recommend this to other parents and consider using Fidgets next year for our daughter's birthday as well! Thanks Michelle for a great party!

He enjoyed his birthday and he had alot of guest that enjoyed themselves too. We had a great turn out and the staff was very helpful the whole time from beginning to end.
His theme was Dinosaur and they decorations they did were perfect we did add a few of our own and they all really went well. It looked great.
I highly recommend this indoor playground for birthdays. Best part is it was closed to public ""only birthday guest ""we had the whole place to ourselves. They offer some really nice add on to we had a photographer come take party pics and pics of the smash cake. We also had a photo booth and had lots of fun with it too. So if you are looking to do a party This Is The Place.

Thank Fidgets for a great First Birthday Party. Till next time.

Review: Me and my family just recently came here for the first time && at first I didn’t think my older kids would enjoy 7&3 but as soon as we walked in the gate the kids and I loved it. Staff very friendly && we were lucky we came in a Tuesday and received free face painting and balloons. My family and I will definitely be visiting again soon.

Review: I went with a friend to Kids Empire for a play date. And it did not disappoint. The play area is huge! There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.

Came for a birthday party and workers actually seemed to enjoy their job and had fun with us. Even dressing up as the dragon and entertaining the party and birthday girl.
Thanks to Lee and team.

Bathrooms were clean and dry. I wish they had paper towels tho, instead of the Dyson hand dryer.
Stools were handy for kids to wash their hands … shockingly not a lot of kids places have that… surely helpful for the moms.

Review: Perfect place for kids anytime of the year but especially during a Vegas summer!!!
Staff are great with wiping down slides and making sure everyone is taken care of.
By far the best kids place in Vegas.
$20 all day. Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.
Today is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.
Plus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)
If you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…

Review: We were going in for the 1st time to let our children play. It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.

I hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.

Review: Decided to give a new play place a try. Checking out with cashier and she sees my girls in grip socks and says we no longer allow grip socks. This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.

You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.

One of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.

We brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.

Highly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!

Review: We found this place thanks to a video of the now-famous Blippi. The truth is, we went to Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday with my family.

My son just turned 5 and is very calm and loves playing with role-playing toys, like tents, playhouses, etc.

It's a great concept, served by a Mexican woman with a wonderful attitude. She and her dad run the business brilliantly, and it's a great time taking the kids while they play safely. You could be working and having a coffee. It's a GREAT option to take the kids if you're already in Las Vegas.

The staff and owners were attentive, helpful, and friendly, fostering a sense of community and love among visitors. Snacks and a seating area were a bonus for energetic kids. The reasonable price point makes this wonderful place an excellent value. Don't forget to bring socks for everyone, including parents.

Review: My daughter was in town and she told me she wanted to take my granddaughter to this place. My granddaughter loves Blippi and this place was supposedly highlighted on the show. When we first arrived the man who greeted us was very friendly. However, my daughter and I very disappointed as we thought that the place would be bigger and more modern. My grandbaby goes on a weekly basis to a play gym in Richmond, Virginia that is VERY clean and modern. So, to see this place that was a hodgepodge of old toys, and stuff was a letdown. Most of the toys seemed dirty  and worn. The carpets were stained from apparent throw up and the carpet padding throughout was thin. For a kids play gym the padding should definitely be upgraded. I experienced the lack of padding after I hurt myself coming off on the slide. Overall, the place was very basic and was not worth the half hour drive from across town.

Review: I hosted my son’s first birthday party here yesterday, and it was an absolutely terrible experience for me and my guests. I have an 11-year-old autistic daughter, and the staff's treatment of her was shocking. One of the female employees repeatedly grabbed my daughter aggressively whenever she had food, instead of simply notifying me or any nearby family members. This was completely inappropriate. On top of that, they were obsessively micromanaging their already filthy carpet, and the same woman was spraying cleaning chemicals around the food while my children and guests were eating. To make matters worse, the male employee was incredibly rude, making odd and uncomfortable remarks throughout the event. We all felt highly uncomfortable the entire time. I am genuinely baffled by the positive reviews—there's no way anyone could be satisfied with service like this. I strongly urge to investigate this, as this level of treatment is unacceptable!

It’s a family owned and operated business- they truly care about cleanliness, safety and provide amazing customer service. If you visit, don’t forget to bring socks. They offer socks at a very reasonable price ($3) just in case you forget.
I love that they are sticklers to the rules so the place stays nice and clean! I saw them constantly sanitizing the tables, chairs etc. My boys had a great time. So happy we live nearby.

I would not feel comfortable alloy 3and 4 year olds running around due to the limited space and with babies all around.  Although I would definitely recommend for parents with children u Der 3

Review: It used to be much better than it is. It feels dirty now and very messy. Toys are everywhere, often have hard toys in the ball pit which poses as a hazard. Kids plowing through other kids, throwing balls at them. There isn’t much structure, and I know parents should be watching their own kids but staff should also enforce it more. Their “cafe” is basic snacks and a basic coffee maker, nothing special. We used to love coming here but it isn’t the same.

Nobody greeted, parents just stared at us. We didn’t know who to talk to, there’s was just a lot of conversation everywhere. We started feeling overwhelmed and we walked out. Really disappointed because we don’t live near the area and we drove here to expect our toddler to play here.

Review: Visited this play centre, on a recent trip from Australia, as we had seen this on the tv show Blippi. We walked in the door, the male worker was arguing with a lady over the insurance waiver. The lady worker told us to fill in the insurance waiver for our 2 year old and then pay at the end. The lady advised no waiver needed for my 8 month old, as he was not crawling and playing on the equipment. My wife and 2 year old entered the play area, I stayed in the enterance to feed my 8 month old. While feeding the male worker was yet again arguing some another customer over the insurance waiver (lady had brought her friends child, and did not have access to previously filled out waiver), this went on for 15 minutes.

After my 8 month old was fed, I went and sat in the “cafe” area of the play center with my child and waited for my eldest to finish. As we were nearly done, I went to pay, as my wife was rounding up the 2 year old. The male worker would not take my money until we were actually leaving (this was fine), he then started to question why my 8 month old did not have an Insurance Waiver…$&@? Is this guy for real?….I explained the situation, and he just went on and on and on….at the end, I turned around and said “you either want my money or you don’t”….this is an old man with nothing else to do!

Play center was not clean, no cafe, small and expensive for what it is. Do not recommend.

Review: Both kids liked playing here.  The 6yr found enough to entertain herself and some other kids to play with, the 13month found some toys also.

Staff is friendly and has some good options for snacks and drinks. As well as different seating options. I like the fact they don't charge for adults, just kids so both parents going doesn't cost additional.

If you are in Vegas and need to make sure your 1 to 6 year old is tired out, this place will do it.

Review: Fun playground for young kids: newborn and prewalker area has bouncers and jumpers to entertain the little ones while the older kids have a two story obstacle course with a slide and ballpit. Dollhouse, dress up costumes, train sets, several playhouses and tons of ride on cars. Big plus for allowing outside food/ snacks to keep the kids happy for hours before getting hangry!

Review: Very cute little place for toddlers wish some of the parents that brought kids there had more respect for the place. It’s annoying to watch parents let their kids destroy things intentionally and barely say a word to them. I feel for the front desk who did ask the kids to stop even though it’s the parents responsibility to keep their kid in check and not just ignore what’s happening.

Review: This is a very toddler-friendly place, so if you have a child under 5, it’s a great option. However, it may not be as engaging for older kids. Since my son is 1, I find it better suited for us compared to other places. Another big advantage is that they have workstations for parents, with desks and chairs, which is fantastic. I can sometimes get work done while keeping an eye on my child playing nearby. The space is also not too large, making it easier to keep track of my kid because I can spot him quickly. Another perk I appreciate is that they allow outside food and drinks, so I can easily feed my son during playtime.

Review: I went to Wigglin' out with my girls the other day. While they did have fun, I dont think we'll be returning. Nothing seemed very clean, lots of damaged or broken toys, and toys not in their correct place (and not being returned to their home by staff in the 2 hours we were there.) The poor girl at the front seemed to be alone, handling everything. I get it, she can only do so much. With that, there were also issues of enforcing rules. There were kids eating in the play area, running, taking off socks, and a child almost leaving the building, which I, personally, had to stop and console him while trying to keep track of my own kids. If the price was half as much as Kangamoo, Wally Wombats, or Kids Town I could see past all these things but for the same price, we'll drive a little farther to go someplace that is more kept up.

If I find a play area that allows them to play while I can sit and decompress, it's always a win. I would say that this play area is great for kids 6 and under based on the size of the toys and space inside of the play area. Bring your own socks, or you can purchase them for only $2/pair. Very clean as well. Friendly staff.

Review: Both my kids (ages 1 & 4) love Wigglin out! We have been coming here for years.

Wigglin Out is a smaller indoor playground, geared towards younger kids, which I love, because some of the bigger playgrounds are overwhelming for toddlers. The facility is locally owned, spotlessly clean, and the owners/staff are so kind.

Wigglin Out is also one of the most reasonably priced indoor playgrounds in Vegas, and they run great specials and host fun events. This is definitely one of our favorite spots for the whole family.

Review: We were in Vegas for a week (end of August) and attended this facility about 4-5 times. We had a fantastic experience. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Most importantly, the facility is more intimate and not as loud/hectic as other indoor playgrounds.

There are plenty of different toys for children to experience. We really valued that the size was more intimate (it made our children less distracted and not as over stimulated as the louder, super bright/neon/flashy places) but most importantly, this Wigglin' Out is OPEN EARLIER than all the other places.

The earlier open hours were key because most children are up early so to have to wait until 11 am to start burning off energy is too close to lunch/nap times. Now keep in mind, we were visiting from Canada so I recognize that earlier weekday hours may not be as important for locals.

But for us, as tourists, this venue was excellent: wonderful customer service, more calm/intimate setting, and better opening hours.

He keeps the center clean and organized. The children have a wonderful time and enjoy playing with each other. It is a perfect place to take my toddler as well as take a break and watch her play. I am a first time parent. Finding places that are made just for her is a little bit hard. This place has ample space for the children to explore yet small enough for me to keep my eyes on my little one, while sitting down. I continue to come became my little one loves it so much. It's were she gets her wiggles out. Thank you Chris for always being wonderful to my family. We truly appreciate it!

Review: This place is great. I’ve been bringing my daughter since she was 11 months old. They have a young toddler section that is somewhat blocked off and you can safely trap your baby in there. Now that my daughter is 20 months she has so much fun running around, jumping, sliding and playing in the ball pit.
This place is a lot cleaner than other indoor playgrounds and I like that it’s not too big so I can keep my eye on her but also give her some space to play.
They have comfy couches for parents and an eating area so the kids can enjoy their snacks. The other great thing is you don’t pay by the hour so you can really let your kids burn off all their energy.

It wasn’t posted anywhere that you had to pay 3 months upfront for the monthly plan (which was $60 or $65 per month, I believe) so heads up on that.

He was very excited to see other children. So this mom complained to the front desk about my child instead of making a connection with me and maybe get our children play together. Like cmon my child is still a baby and I’m doing my best to teach him the right way and it’s not like every parent is perfect, we all make mistakes when educating our children. The front desk person was telling me to supervise my child better and tell him the right way to behave. I’m trying to do my mom job and I have a very active baby and I get tired too. I was told in a rude manner as though saying we are not welcomed back. Especially the other mom was a regular customer. I could become a regular Cust too. I need my money back please

Review: I do not recommend this place. The first strike was that they charge for parents to sit and watch the kids. Fine, it's poor customer relations but it's their business to run. Strike two is if you want to go in to watch you must buy their socks even just to sit and watch. When I protested I was told that was their policy and I didn't have to stay if I didn't like it. I didn't and didn't. That was strike three. This is not a business I want to support and I ask that you don't either.

Review: I have been here multiple times, and I almost booked a birthday party here one year.. but we were in the area so I had decided to play here last Sunday. But we couldn’t even get inside. And after I found out what happened, I will NEVER return.
The parking lot had at least 30 cops, and I asked one grandma, as She was being shuffled out of the building, what happened? This is as the police were taping off the parking lot area, and eventually, the front door after hurrying several other people out of there. She told me, “go, get out of here! There was gunfire! Go!” I will absolutely not return after that, for obvious reasons.

But despite that incident… I would still give this place 1 star because they never keep anything clean. We used to come here a lot, but we had stopped and went to different indoor playgrounds because nearly every time that we would come here, within the next 2-3 days, my kid was sick. And he would end up with an ear infection as a result, and it was really bad. It was at least three separate times that we came to LOL and my son was sick a couple days after.
My son was only 2 then, and I was at home with him all the time.. he couldn’t have got sick from anywhere but here as he was not in daycare, and we really didn’t leave the house very much at all, therefore I know that it had to have been at LOL that he got sick. Kids will be running around coughing and sneezing and still playing and touching everything. If your kid is sick you should not bring them out to a place like this, obviously, but soo many people do it anyways! So rude.

The staff could have done temperate checks during cold/flu season? Or if they saw an obviously sick child, ask the family to leave and sanitize the area? But you don’t see the staff ever cleaning anything here. The tables are a mess a lot of the time, the play area is worse. They only walk around with a leaf blower to “clean” up the ballpit balls that have gone astray. Never seen anyone wipe anything down.
You can tell they don’t really care to clean much of the many surfaces because obvious shoe marks, dirt, etc. all over the play area and floor. The ball pit balls feel disgusting and greasy. It’s the worst on the high levels of the play area. I’ve climbed to the very top which is very high up and that’s where it looks the dirtiest, probably because it’s not as accessible as the ground floor and most parents aren’t up there to notice. But why are there dirty shoe marks when it is a “socks only” facility anyways?!

It is too bad the staff/owner don’t really care, because this place would be great if I was just judging the playground equipment! Unfortunately, they allow in what I feel like is more than their capacity should be, and the place is flooded with kids running left and right, no staff supervision anywhere at all, and they don’t clean a thing afterwards.
The owners obviously don’t care to change their policies and improve this place as I’ve seen numerous other reviews that were recently posted.
Overall they lack sanitation for a children’s facility and we saw the aftermath of an extremely dangerous hazard in a children’s play place… so thankful we weren’t inside when this occurred and I hope everyone was okay.
I hope they get shut down after this incident, it is so not ok for this to have been happening at a place for kids. If they stay open I think they should install metal detectors & hire a decent cleaning crew to sanitize this place.
Will never return ever. I already avoided coming here when my kid would ask, instead I’d suggest a different indoor playground, but now it will be a hard no.
I wouldn’t have even came here today in the first place, but we happened to be nearby on that side of town, so I said fine we will go.
But driving there, I kept telling my son, don’t put your hands in your mouth or on your face, unless you want to get sick!

Review: Great place for the kids, good choice of food and snacks. I really wish they run the AC a bit cooler in this place though, those kids be coming out looking like they came from the pool... I get they are running around but the amount of bodies the room gets warm fast. Especially its summer now with 100+ degrees outside inside should be cool. As a parent just sitting in the dining area its warm..

This place is one of the better bigger indoor play area in the southwest.

Review: This place is a huge safety hazard for kids. There are plastic balls everywhere, many of them cracked and no staff in the playing area at all to monitor. Extremely dirty due to zero maintenance. On top of that the girl at check in was so unprofessional - charged me extra and when I mentioned it after I looked at the rates, she just rolled her eyes and said I should have told her before making payment and that she can’t do anything now. Was unbelievable and so apalling! When I asked if there is someone else I can talk to, she just said there isn’t any supervisor/manager. No apology and zero people’s skills.  She either hated her job or was just a bad person.
I had my kids with me so I went in even though I didn’t want to. I called their customer service line the same night and I was assured the manager will call me in the morning but no one called and it’s been almost a month now.
Hence I am writing this review as it is clear that the problem is not just employees but the business itself. I definitely am not returning and want to warn others as well.

Review: My children enjoyed themselves when they werent slipping on balls that were literally ALL over the place or getting balls thrown in their face by other peoples children who were not being supervised. This place has no safety percautions in place AT ALL. There are children of all ages big and small running at full speed around this small area with no regards to their surroundings even on the concrete where the seating area is located which is a major safety concern since everyone is in socks, I guess thats why you have to sign a waiver prior to entering this danger zone. There is no staff supervision, rule enforcement, limtiation on the number of people inside, no staff picking up the balls that are sacttered in the sitting area which is again all concrete. The food is over priced and definitely not worth it, nothing comes out as it is on the pictures. I ordered Juju nacho supreme wish i would have taken a pic for comparison before throwing them away. In the picture on the menu it shows beef on the nachos, it was given to me with chopped up chicken strips and  none of the toppings on the picture. There is no description of whats on anything just a name and a picture. Great concept for a play place but definitely needs some work!

Review: Came here last Sunday 2/16/25 with my 2 grandchildren. I mean the kids had fun that’s the main thing.

My complaint was that the snack bar prices are way too high.  I ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches which had to be ordered as part of a combo meal. No alacart option.  And it came up to around $42.33.  This cost more than the admission for my two grandkids.  They didn’t have an option to pay in any other form except Zelle…I thought that was peculiar since the snack bar accepted debit/credit…

Bottom- line is that I don’t think we’ll be patronizing this establishment again.

Staff-
Front desk staff were apologetic about having to send a Zelle payment for admission.  For the most part type two gals were friendly and courteous.

Cafe staff.
5/10 for service and value

Was invited to a birthday party and the floor in the room was very slippery. Many slips happened, including me. Yes you sign a waiver to enter. Now I see why. Fun place for kids, but this is just one big injury/lawsuit waiting to happen. Now imagine having to go into the public bathroom, in your socks. I did not want to try that.

Review: I was extremely disappointed with our experience at LOL Kids Club in Las Vegas. It’s supposed to be a fun and inclusive place for children, but unfortunately, we experienced clear discrimination during our visit. The staff treated us unfairly compared to other guests, and when we brought up our concerns, they were dismissive and unhelpful. No family should have to deal with this kind of treatment, especially in a place meant for kids to feel safe and welcome. I will not be returning, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately.

The Arabic man who says he is the manager is horrible. Looked my two 6 year olds and 1 year old in the face and told them he wasn’t letting them in and they were not going to play today.  Do not bring your children. Children do not deserve this verbal abuse.

Review: If this place can get a 0 rating, it would have been given quickly! This was my first and it will certainly be my last. They expects you to take your shoes off as soon as you get in but their restroom is filthy! I ordered food and found hair in my food. When I addressed it to the lady in the kitchen she didn’t apologize or offer anything else. She just stated “okay” and walked away… Save your money, time, and energy for a place where it not only be cleaned/sanitized but who can be kind! Kindness goes a long way!!

Originally, I rated a 1 star ⭐️ However, I brought it up to a 3. I believe it was the manager that came back and refunded me for my onion rings that had hair in it. I appreciate the effort to try and make things right. That’s an honorable thing he did and I thank him for coming to speak with me and asked if there was anything else he can do for me.

While I felt like the situation was handled inappropriately. I would like to send my sincere apology to the young woman who walked away. I’m learning that people have different responding mechanisms. But want to extend my thank you for bringing it up to management attention to help make things right.

But please, clean your restrooms and floors. Help keep our community healthy.

And be aware for entry rate. 2 parents with 2 kids in a single payment transaction is more expensive then 2 separate charges (1adult+1child). They rip you off if you dont pay your attention.

Review: My daughter recently hosted my twin granddaughter's birthday party at LOL Kids, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place. My daughter paid $1600 for their Ultimate Package, which included 3 rooms, food (8 large pizzas, 2 appetizer platters, 2 salad platters), unlimited drinks, and icee treats for the kids. While the price was hefty, we expected great service and a smooth experience for such a special occasion – but that wasn’t the case.

Issues we faced:
1.	Shoes Policy Problems: Upon arrival, we were told all adults had to remove their shoes. This included elders and people with health issues who would be sitting the entire time. We had to argue with staff to get waivers to allow our elderly family members to keep their shoes on, which should have been handled more gracefully.

2.	Room Mix-Up: To our surprise, when we got to our reserved rooms, they were given away to another party. We spent nearly 45 minutes sorting this out, and the issue wasn’t resolved until we spoke with the owner. The excuse they gave was that they thought we were part of another party, but no one bothered to confirm anything. It was very frustrating, and we didn’t even get into our rooms until an hour after the scheduled party time. As compensation for the inconvenience, the owner gave us a frozen tiramisu cake and two fruit trays – hardly an adequate fix.

3.	Poor Food and Service: The service at the party was subpar. The host was unprofessional, and we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks and inquire about the food. We were given random food substitutions, like ranch dressing instead of the Caesar dressing we ordered. When we asked the staff about it, they acted like they didn’t know what we were talking about, and one of the workers at the register admitted they had just run out of the correct dressing. Additionally, we had to keep asking for plates, cups, and basic items, which seemed to annoy the host.

For the amount of money we paid, we expected much better service and attention to detail. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing a positive experience.
Final Thoughts: If you’re planning to book a party for your children here, be prepared for potential stress and poor service. The lack of professionalism, mix-ups with reservations, and inattentiveness from the staff made this a frustrating and disappointing experience. For the price, there are certainly better venues that will respect your time, money, and your child’s special day.

Review: Just spent the past two hours here and had a great time. Both kids and grown ups could play. Food was pretty good. Definitely worth the price. UNFORTUNATELY, at the bottom of the big red slide in the ball pit I found my 2 year old daughter playing with this knife. Thankfully it was closed, but I can't even imagine if it was open and my kid or another slid down onto it. Ended up getting sidetracked with my kid running away and forgot to mention it to a worker, I wish I did. Anyway, I feel that they should have someone regularly checking the ball pits and play areas for things like this. It makes sense that ANYTHING can fall out of ANYONES pockets here, it should be regularly checked. Place was fun, a bit run down, but finding the knife definitely was not. 2/5 stars for that reason.

Review: I never thought I'd leave a review wishing for a zero or negative star option, but here we are. I've been to this children's play place more than once, and my previous experience was disappointing due to the cleanliness of the play area and the staff's attitude. We let a Groupon expire because I didn’t want to return. But after my daughter kept asking to go for the last two weeks, I figured we’d give it another shot, hoping it had improved. Unfortunately, it’s worse than ever.

We visited on Saturday, 8/24/24, meeting friends for a playdate when the place opened. After letting the kids (both 5 years old) settle in, we sat down, periodically checking on them. The floors in the seating areas were filthy, covered in shoe and sock prints, and this was right after opening. Then, my daughter came over and told me she stepped on glass. Shocked, I asked her to show me where. Meanwhile, her friend showed her mom a small injury she had gotten while trying to avoid the glass, causing her to fall and land on the glass, which ripped her new leggings and cut her knee, making it bleed.

I walked over and saw glass scattered everywhere near the front windows. Another parent mentioned that their child had found the rock that had clearly broken the window. When my friend asked for a bandaid and the staff saw her daughter's bleeding leg, they told her it had already been cleaned up. I then informed them that was definitely not the case; glass was still all over the mats. This is a play place where kids are required to wear socks only. One child was already bleeding, and that was the staff’s response? A few of us parents started using toys to barricade off the area because the glass had spread over a large area. There was no urgency from the staff; they eventually came over with brooms and said, ""It's not our fault people keep breaking our windows."" True, it’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to maintain a safe environment for the kids.

Despite our concerns, the girls wanted to keep playing, so we kept them away from that area. The staff’s cleaning efforts were inadequate—they didn’t even bother to get a vacuum to clean up the shards of glass on the mats. They removed our barricades. It wasn’t until the owner arrived later that the staff finally brought out a shop vac and sealed the window to clean up the glass properly. Yet, the owner never checked in with my friend to see how her daughter was doing.

When our kids got hungry, we ordered food: one large pizza and an order of chicken spring rolls. The food took a long time to arrive. When I bit into the spring rolls, I found a triangular piece of bone inside the chopped chicken. I took multiple pictures as proof. Then I noticed a rash on my friend’s daughter, which hadn’t been there before. That was the last straw; we decided it was time to go.

This place is a disaster—the staff is terrible, and there’s zero regulation on older kids roughhousing. An older boy, maybe 8-10 years old, was grabbing my daughter’s hands in the ball pit, and I had to intervene calmly. No parents were in sight.

When you go to a play place, there’s an expectation of cleanliness, kindness, and safety—this place has none of those. To top it off, only one sink in the women’s bathroom worked, the paper towel dispenser handle was broken, one toilet was out of order, and another was clogged. The toys, like the large Legos and the balls, were filthy, and even my daughter mentioned that the slides were dirty.

We had to explain to our girls that we were leaving because it wasn’t safe—between the broken glass, the bone in my food, and the rash, it was time to go and never come back. I’ve mentioned this experience to other mom friends, and they all had horrible things to say about this place. I have no idea how this place is still open; it needs to be shut down.

3. OVER priced for the small space kids have to play. The kids get bored with such limited things to do.

Go to a trampoline park. It's a much better value and kids will have more to do. Plus you won't get knocked over the head with charges just to watch your own kids....

It is obviously not well maintained at all.  Dirty, and SO many games broken but not marked as such.  Dropped a lot of coins that got us nothing.  Adult pricing seems excessive and to have to buy their socks - though I was sitting at a table the whole time seemed foolish.
Their listing should boldly state their shoes/ socks policy.
Their house keeping needs a royal step up and their employees need to learn some manners.  Disappointing.

Review: As seen on Blippi adventures we had to come here on our family vacation! Good food, clean, friendly staff ( though at on point one male employee was pretending to punch a female employee in face which I found inappropriate at a kids play place) my son had a great time and the equipment is tall enough you can help your kids around the gym as needed. Fast slides, mini arcade games and so much more!

Review: Went there for the first time today. Admission is reasonable. Cashier in the front didn’t give us wrist bands so that made leaving confusing. Food was pricey but decent, took almost an hour before we got our food and partially due to them not properly putting phone number in for text notification. Kids had a lot of fun though. I feel like there should be staff walking through checking on kids cause it is a big area and to try to keep balls in their areas as it is a tripping hazard. This area is so big you can lose a kiddo and if they don’t actually check wristbands/neglect to give them then I feel this could be a major safety hazard. I do like that you have unlimited play time though unlike other places we have gone to.

Review: Had a very uncomfortable experience here. Came here with my son my sister and nephew on Memorial Day the man that checked us in gave me a really hard time because we wanted to pay separately instead of together to avoid the additional $7.95 charge for an adult. He made me put my son’s water cup in the dirty shoe bin because water was “not allowed.” Upon entering I noticed water canteens on almost every table so I went back and brought this to his attention where he then gave me my son’s water cup back. Very strange. I’m 7 months pregnant and wanted to take my son to do something fun and in turn I come here just to feel super stressed out and uncomfortable by a grumpy employee. Super disappointing. Bathrooms are completely disgusting as well, brown on the walls in the stall. So it seems that the staff was concerned with my son’s water bottle than anything else! There’s a Wally Wombats not far from this place, way cleaner and friendly customer service.

Review: I can’t comment on their playground because I didn’t get inside. My issue was with their policy on charging adults. I arrived with friends, each accompanied by their own child. When we were asked if we came together, I said yes and offered to pay for everyone, expecting my friends to reimburse me later. Despite each adult having their own child and us all signing waivers, they insisted on charging me for four adults simply because we arrived as a group. I questioned why we had to pay extra when they weren’t providing any additional care for our kids. They replied it was their policy for group arrivals. Frustrated, I requested a refund and went to Kangamoo at Sunset instead.

Review: This place is not safe for kids, I have attached a few pictures. There is no space between rides for little ones to get off. Three of the rides were broken but will still take your money. Cracked plastic on one of the rides with sharp edges. The moment you walk in,the bench along the wall has exposed electric cables sticking out of the led strip. I'm inclined to report this to State officials.

Review: The positives - The staff were very friendly. The place is large with a good layout.

The negatives - The posted food menu did not match what the cashier was ringing up and she could not change it to match without being up charged.  Waited 45 minutes for a quesadilla and chicken sandwich.  The bathroom was disgusting and we arrived near opening so it was not restocked from the night before or cleaned.  Leaking toilets while wearing socks, there are sandals but no sign if for public use so was unsure who's they were.  The machines for the kids to use in the play area were broken or lacking power to where the balls would not shoot out or power up.  The games seemed expensive, $1 for 2 tokens.

Overall I'd say it was ok.  If they maintained the broken items and cleaned better it would be a five star.

Review: We went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't crazy busy, which I was happy about. It's a very large play place, and sometimes, when it's too busy, the little ones get hurt/run over by older kids. All the kids, for the most part, appeared to be under 6 when I was there.  The jungle gym is big enough that a parent is able to climb through it as well. Seemed pretty clean, didn't go to the restrooms which I hate because you're in socks only. They have some arcade games, but after spending $18 to get in, it can get expensive playing games. The birthday space I wasn't impressed with simply because it's all linked together in one large room.  Just rows of tables, maybe 10 - 15, so you don't have a personal space. You're behind glass separated from the general public, but not from anyone else having a birthday party at the same time. There's plenty of seating available for parents while the kids play, and the snack bar has a nice variety of items. Pricing wise they're high, but it's a play place so I expected it. It was almost $7 for a small slurpee (6 or 8oz I believe) and bottle of water.  The air guns in the playpen weren't working and there are several of them. Looked like no one had checked them to see because balls were stuck in them that weren't intended for the guns. I wasn't able to pull them out, and even guns that had nothing stuck in them weren't working either. Overall, my daughter enjoyed herself so I'd definitely go back.

Review: This place was great when it first opened up. I hadn't been in a few years, and took my three kids last week. The employees do a good job of keeping everything picked up and clean on the surface... But this place needs a deep cleaning BAD! The entire playground area had a faint smell of urine, and everything has a layer of grime on it. I was really iffy about letting my one year old climb on things, and sure enough he ended up sick. Half the stuff was broken (one of the trampolines, the zipline, etc), BUT, my kids still had a blast. In all honesty though, I'll probably just choose a different playground next time that I know is very clean.

Review: This playground has honestly been the worst experience for my daughter . My daughter has gotten sick here multiple times , they aren’t very sanitary , I’ve been missing months for it to be better but nope workers sitting on their bum selfs on their phones not cleaning play area at all some how it gets dirtier each day it’s a socks only howww ? yes I understand it’s a playground for children but it’s also very hazardous , there’s a lot of broken things , broken steps and a window where my daughter was about to fall from . There’s been so many concerns for me , children aggressively pushing my daughter , calling her stupid , mothers fighting amongst each other , the staff works for nothing and doesn’t ever intervene . I’ve escalated my concerns with the owner and she has shown no interest whatsoever, instead of providing solutions for her playground she just says her workers aren’t police officers ? She has also mentioned that she plans on not having any maintenance done to the playground not even within a year as she also made it known that she was the cheapest and best in town and actually planned on raising her prices , you can’t even express your concerns to the workers because you get strikes as a customer ? She has also just said other places are better than hers while giving the excuse of her playground being old ? Half of the place is torn down lady. Overall such an awful option , I originally opted towards this playground because of how conveniently close it was to my house but I will be resorting to anything and everything else for the best experience for my daughter . I had the year membership and gave these issues time to be resolved and they just worsened . I recommend Wally Wombats , it’s only $5 more for the annual membership and it’s an overall better alternative . Good Luck to kangamoo

Review: Kangamoo Indoor Playground on Sunset Road in Las Vegas proved to be the perfect spot for a fun day with the little ones. Centrally located and easy to access, it’s filled with exciting activities geared toward younger children. The playground is very clean and well-maintained, which immediately put us at ease as the kids explored the slides, climbing structures, and interactive areas. They enjoyed every minute, darting from one play zone to the next with endless energy. The welcoming environment and thoughtful setup made this a delightful outing for everyone.

Review: No compassion, no kindness. My one year old was crying desperately and I was just trying to feed him with ONE GRAPE to calm him, but immediately they told me that outside food wasn’t allowed inside (only their junk food of course). They couldn’t wait for the baby to calm down. Also, this employee was always speaking on the speakers telling kids what not to do. Very annoying. If in spaces for kids there’s no compassion and kindness, where are we supposed to go?
It’s a nice structure though, and I bet with different management it would be a great place for kids.

Things we loved:
-PLENTY of toys and a great variety too
-An extensive play gym
-Several trampolines
-Kid friendly restrooms that were easily accessible
-plenty of seating for parents following their little ones around the play gym
-Two massage chairs for parents
-An elliptical
-Food available for purchase
-Cubbies and lockers

Our son didn’t have socks but thankfully we were able to purchase them on site.

Our son had so much fun here. We will be back for sure during our next annual trip to Vegas.

Review: The toys, floors, and climbing areas are caked in dirt, looks like they haven't been cleaned in a long time.

The snack selection is poor, nothing healthy at all just chips and pizza.

We ended up getting sick as well a few days after going here, likely because nothing was cleaned.

Also saw multiple kids bullying other kids with no parent intervention, lots of yelling and screaming while the parents sit and scroll on their phones.

Overall, WAY too many kids at once, there should be a limit. Poor food selections, everything is dirty, I mean my daughter's hands were black from climbing up the playground..just gross and not worth the money at all.

They even played with my little guy, and he had so much fun. Throughout our visit, I kept seeing employees constantly cleaning and disinfecting toys and common areas. I highly recommend this place, and my older boy is already asking to go back before we leave!

Most of the time have children in them as well and it went from $10to $14 per child I've since been to many other places and see there's better but it's still ok for people who it works for and that's why I still give 4stars

Review: DANGER! Don't Bring Your Little Kids Here!
I brought my 3 year old here today and it's full of adults barreling down the slides head-first (without kids) and teenagers bullying little kids on the trampoline. The big kids - far too old to be there were boisterous and dangerous, pushing little ones over. It isn't a place for little kids.

Not to mention there were FAR too many people in there - clearly part-time parents and their family members. There should be limits to two adults per kid.
There was a 350lb man up on the climbing frame net area making the whole thing creak and shake and the useless TEEN staff (clearly management doesn't want to pay adults!) couldn't manage anything. It is a matter of time until that comes down on someone's head.

The whole place is a disaster and danger to children. There should be an upper age restriction on how old kids can be to enter - it's not a place for the over 10s and this was being exploited because of the useless management.

The running around of a 5-year-old does not have the same momentum as a ten-year-old running around, ploughing into little ones. Again, the little mouse voices from 'management' did nothing and the trash parents were more interested in their phones than watching their kids. Upon entry, they should be spoken to about watching their kids, not to let them bully and over tens should be turned away.

Also, their toxic stamp takes 60 years to remove and will make my kid's arm red in the bathtub, trying to get it off.

Avoid. At all costs. It's a matter of time until a kid is really hurt - or worse at this clown show and they get sued into oblivion regardless of their stupid waiver or signs, that no one reads.
If I could rate it minus stars, I would.
We will never be back and we'll be telling other parents to avoid the place too.

Review: As of January 1st 2024, they are now under new management. They have untrained employees, no managers on site and give out party contract details to anyone who asks even without permission from someone who booked the party. I would recommend visiting a different location if you would like your child to have a good time as this one is unprofessional. Also they no longer serve food for parties even with signs everywhere saying they have food.

Review: I was there for the first time on December 19th and the entire team on that day was super helpful. So I went back on December 20th and to my disappointment, the two attendants who are in the courtyard were exclusively looking after a single child and that same child wanted me to take my daughter out of Jump so she could feel comfortable. obviously I didn't take it away, it's a collective space. Then these two attendants went down the slide with that same child. They were taking exclusive care of her and in the end they even made a balloon flower, ignoring all the children who were in the space. Then my daughter chose a snack, but I was without my wallet waiting for my husband to arrive in 10 minutes and the attendant was super rude saying that I couldn't open the snack package without first having to pay $1. My daughter is autistic and was very upset by the situation. If I paid $14 why wouldn't I pay $1. and he was still mocking. I will not return to this place again.

Review: ***WARNING*** Worst Birthday Party experience ever......

We booked the party in Aug. For today Nov. 11th. At the time of booking I was told IF more than 15 kids showed I would be charged for the 22 child count party. OK not a problem.

I was also told we would get 2 full hours in the party room.

When I arrived today I was CHARGED for the 22 child party as soon as I walk through the door. They did not even wait for the head count. Then also asked for a TIP. Right as we arrived.

The employees could have cared less about helping us set up the party!!!

The ""party host"" with the party was virtually none existent. We did basically everything ourselves from set up to clean up!

When the party was about over we were told to vacate the party room before the party for even over. BEFORE the 2 hour mark! The hostess finally showed up and said we could stay additional time for another $50.00.

When I went to the cashier she number 1 refused to give us out money back because it was a 15 child party not 22.

Secondly, she refused to give us an additional few mintues in the party room that the hostess communicated we could pay for.

NOT one person was kind or courteous. There was very poor communication. We were for lack of better terms over charged for the party head count.

Not a family friendly or good customer service experience at all.

When I asked to speak with a manager I was told I had to wait until Monday and call them.

Despite Kangamoos extremely poor customer service. We tipped the one person who did check on us well.

Needless to say, unless this very Bad experience is addressed.  NONE of us at the party plan to visit this establishment again in the future.

Dear manager. Call Me! Signed an overcharged patron!

I will gladly update this review IF management contacts me to corrext this wrong and experience. B Because they will deserve a kudos for effort. I have to wait until Monday to talk with anyone.

Review: I purchased a punch pass for a Christmas gift and had my purse stolen and therefore the punch pass. They refuse to give me a new pass (and you can clearly tell the pass has never been used) or refund the $95 spent on it. I was shrugged at and told they’ve had people have their whole cars stolen and won’t replace it. We will not be back and will not support a place that operates like this. What’s the point of having us sign a log book upon purchase of the pass if you can’t track it? I’m a Nanny that has been here with lots of kids here and we will not be back.

Review: I do not recommend this place. The first strike was that they charge for parents to sit and watch the kids. Fine, it's poor customer relations but it's their business to run. Strike two is if you want to go in to watch you must buy their socks even just to sit and watch. When I protested I was told that was their policy and I didn't have to stay if I didn't like it. I didn't and didn't. That was strike three. This is not a business I want to support and I ask that you don't either.

Review: I have been here multiple times, and I almost booked a birthday party here one year.. but we were in the area so I had decided to play here last Sunday. But we couldn’t even get inside. And after I found out what happened, I will NEVER return.
The parking lot had at least 30 cops, and I asked one grandma, as She was being shuffled out of the building, what happened? This is as the police were taping off the parking lot area, and eventually, the front door after hurrying several other people out of there. She told me, “go, get out of here! There was gunfire! Go!” I will absolutely not return after that, for obvious reasons.

But despite that incident… I would still give this place 1 star because they never keep anything clean. We used to come here a lot, but we had stopped and went to different indoor playgrounds because nearly every time that we would come here, within the next 2-3 days, my kid was sick. And he would end up with an ear infection as a result, and it was really bad. It was at least three separate times that we came to LOL and my son was sick a couple days after.
My son was only 2 then, and I was at home with him all the time.. he couldn’t have got sick from anywhere but here as he was not in daycare, and we really didn’t leave the house very much at all, therefore I know that it had to have been at LOL that he got sick. Kids will be running around coughing and sneezing and still playing and touching everything. If your kid is sick you should not bring them out to a place like this, obviously, but soo many people do it anyways! So rude.

The staff could have done temperate checks during cold/flu season? Or if they saw an obviously sick child, ask the family to leave and sanitize the area? But you don’t see the staff ever cleaning anything here. The tables are a mess a lot of the time, the play area is worse. They only walk around with a leaf blower to “clean” up the ballpit balls that have gone astray. Never seen anyone wipe anything down.
You can tell they don’t really care to clean much of the many surfaces because obvious shoe marks, dirt, etc. all over the play area and floor. The ball pit balls feel disgusting and greasy. It’s the worst on the high levels of the play area. I’ve climbed to the very top which is very high up and that’s where it looks the dirtiest, probably because it’s not as accessible as the ground floor and most parents aren’t up there to notice. But why are there dirty shoe marks when it is a “socks only” facility anyways?!

It is too bad the staff/owner don’t really care, because this place would be great if I was just judging the playground equipment! Unfortunately, they allow in what I feel like is more than their capacity should be, and the place is flooded with kids running left and right, no staff supervision anywhere at all, and they don’t clean a thing afterwards.
The owners obviously don’t care to change their policies and improve this place as I’ve seen numerous other reviews that were recently posted.
Overall they lack sanitation for a children’s facility and we saw the aftermath of an extremely dangerous hazard in a children’s play place… so thankful we weren’t inside when this occurred and I hope everyone was okay.
I hope they get shut down after this incident, it is so not ok for this to have been happening at a place for kids. If they stay open I think they should install metal detectors & hire a decent cleaning crew to sanitize this place.
Will never return ever. I already avoided coming here when my kid would ask, instead I’d suggest a different indoor playground, but now it will be a hard no.
I wouldn’t have even came here today in the first place, but we happened to be nearby on that side of town, so I said fine we will go.
But driving there, I kept telling my son, don’t put your hands in your mouth or on your face, unless you want to get sick!

Review: This place is a huge safety hazard for kids. There are plastic balls everywhere, many of them cracked and no staff in the playing area at all to monitor. Extremely dirty due to zero maintenance. On top of that the girl at check in was so unprofessional - charged me extra and when I mentioned it after I looked at the rates, she just rolled her eyes and said I should have told her before making payment and that she can’t do anything now. Was unbelievable and so apalling! When I asked if there is someone else I can talk to, she just said there isn’t any supervisor/manager. No apology and zero people’s skills.  She either hated her job or was just a bad person.
I had my kids with me so I went in even though I didn’t want to. I called their customer service line the same night and I was assured the manager will call me in the morning but no one called and it’s been almost a month now.
Hence I am writing this review as it is clear that the problem is not just employees but the business itself. I definitely am not returning and want to warn others as well.

Review: My children enjoyed themselves when they werent slipping on balls that were literally ALL over the place or getting balls thrown in their face by other peoples children who were not being supervised. This place has no safety percautions in place AT ALL. There are children of all ages big and small running at full speed around this small area with no regards to their surroundings even on the concrete where the seating area is located which is a major safety concern since everyone is in socks, I guess thats why you have to sign a waiver prior to entering this danger zone. There is no staff supervision, rule enforcement, limtiation on the number of people inside, no staff picking up the balls that are sacttered in the sitting area which is again all concrete. The food is over priced and definitely not worth it, nothing comes out as it is on the pictures. I ordered Juju nacho supreme wish i would have taken a pic for comparison before throwing them away. In the picture on the menu it shows beef on the nachos, it was given to me with chopped up chicken strips and  none of the toppings on the picture. There is no description of whats on anything just a name and a picture. Great concept for a play place but definitely needs some work!

Review: Came here last Sunday 2/16/25 with my 2 grandchildren. I mean the kids had fun that’s the main thing.

My complaint was that the snack bar prices are way too high.  I ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches which had to be ordered as part of a combo meal. No alacart option.  And it came up to around $42.33.  This cost more than the admission for my two grandkids.  They didn’t have an option to pay in any other form except Zelle…I thought that was peculiar since the snack bar accepted debit/credit…

Bottom- line is that I don’t think we’ll be patronizing this establishment again.

Staff-
Front desk staff were apologetic about having to send a Zelle payment for admission.  For the most part type two gals were friendly and courteous.

Cafe staff.

Fun place for kids, but this is just one big injury/lawsuit waiting to happen. Now imagine having to go into the public bathroom, in your socks. I did not want to try that.

Review: I was extremely disappointed with our experience at LOL Kids Club in Las Vegas. It’s supposed to be a fun and inclusive place for children, but unfortunately, we experienced clear discrimination during our visit. The staff treated us unfairly compared to other guests, and when we brought up our concerns, they were dismissive and unhelpful. No family should have to deal with this kind of treatment, especially in a place meant for kids to feel safe and welcome. I will not be returning, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately.

The Arabic man who says he is the manager is horrible. Looked my two 6 year olds and 1 year old in the face and told them he wasn’t letting them in and they were not going to play today.  Do not bring your children. Children do not deserve this verbal abuse.

Review: If this place can get a 0 rating, it would have been given quickly! This was my first and it will certainly be my last. They expects you to take your shoes off as soon as you get in but their restroom is filthy! I ordered food and found hair in my food. When I addressed it to the lady in the kitchen she didn’t apologize or offer anything else. She just stated “okay” and walked away… Save your money, time, and energy for a place where it not only be cleaned/sanitized but who can be kind! Kindness goes a long way!!

Originally, I rated a 1 star ⭐️ However, I brought it up to a 3. I believe it was the manager that came back and refunded me for my onion rings that had hair in it. I appreciate the effort to try and make things right. That’s an honorable thing he did and I thank him for coming to speak with me and asked if there was anything else he can do for me.

While I felt like the situation was handled inappropriately. I would like to send my sincere apology to the young woman who walked away. I’m learning that people have different responding mechanisms. But want to extend my thank you for bringing it up to management attention to help make things right.

But please, clean your restrooms and floors. Help keep our community healthy.

Thanks!

Review: Staff is very rude and disrespectful. I and my wife went there with our 2 kids and ask additional box for shoes and jackets because all staff wasn't fit in one. Answer shocked me - ""one box per family"". Can u imagine? Plastic box for shoes is very limited in this place.
And be aware for entry rate. 2 parents with 2 kids in a single payment transaction is more expensive then 2 separate charges (1adult+1child). They rip you off if you dont pay your attention.

Review: My daughter recently hosted my twin granddaughter's birthday party at LOL Kids, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place. My daughter paid $1600 for their Ultimate Package, which included 3 rooms, food (8 large pizzas, 2 appetizer platters, 2 salad platters), unlimited drinks, and icee treats for the kids. While the price was hefty, we expected great service and a smooth experience for such a special occasion – but that wasn’t the case.

Issues we faced:
1.	Shoes Policy Problems: Upon arrival, we were told all adults had to remove their shoes. This included elders and people with health issues who would be sitting the entire time. We had to argue with staff to get waivers to allow our elderly family members to keep their shoes on, which should have been handled more gracefully.

2.	Room Mix-Up: To our surprise, when we got to our reserved rooms, they were given away to another party. We spent nearly 45 minutes sorting this out, and the issue wasn’t resolved until we spoke with the owner. The excuse they gave was that they thought we were part of another party, but no one bothered to confirm anything. It was very frustrating, and we didn’t even get into our rooms until an hour after the scheduled party time. As compensation for the inconvenience, the owner gave us a frozen tiramisu cake and two fruit trays – hardly an adequate fix.

3.	Poor Food and Service: The service at the party was subpar. The host was unprofessional, and we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks and inquire about the food. We were given random food substitutions, like ranch dressing instead of the Caesar dressing we ordered. When we asked the staff about it, they acted like they didn’t know what we were talking about, and one of the workers at the register admitted they had just run out of the correct dressing. Additionally, we had to keep asking for plates, cups, and basic items, which seemed to annoy the host.

For the amount of money we paid, we expected much better service and attention to detail. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing a positive experience.
Final Thoughts: If you’re planning to book a party for your children here, be prepared for potential stress and poor service. The lack of professionalism, mix-ups with reservations, and inattentiveness from the staff made this a frustrating and disappointing experience. For the price, there are certainly better venues that will respect your time, money, and your child’s special day.

Review: Just spent the past two hours here and had a great time. Both kids and grown ups could play. Food was pretty good. Definitely worth the price. UNFORTUNATELY, at the bottom of the big red slide in the ball pit I found my 2 year old daughter playing with this knife. Thankfully it was closed, but I can't even imagine if it was open and my kid or another slid down onto it. Ended up getting sidetracked with my kid running away and forgot to mention it to a worker, I wish I did. Anyway, I feel that they should have someone regularly checking the ball pits and play areas for things like this. It makes sense that ANYTHING can fall out of ANYONES pockets here, it should be regularly checked. Place was fun, a bit run down, but finding the knife definitely was not. 2/5 stars for that reason.

Review: I never thought I'd leave a review wishing for a zero or negative star option, but here we are. I've been to this children's play place more than once, and my previous experience was disappointing due to the cleanliness of the play area and the staff's attitude. We let a Groupon expire because I didn’t want to return. But after my daughter kept asking to go for the last two weeks, I figured we’d give it another shot, hoping it had improved. Unfortunately, it’s worse than ever.

We visited on Saturday, 8/24/24, meeting friends for a playdate when the place opened. After letting the kids (both 5 years old) settle in, we sat down, periodically checking on them. The floors in the seating areas were filthy, covered in shoe and sock prints, and this was right after opening. Then, my daughter came over and told me she stepped on glass. Shocked, I asked her to show me where. Meanwhile, her friend showed her mom a small injury she had gotten while trying to avoid the glass, causing her to fall and land on the glass, which ripped her new leggings and cut her knee, making it bleed.

I walked over and saw glass scattered everywhere near the front windows. Another parent mentioned that their child had found the rock that had clearly broken the window. When my friend asked for a bandaid and the staff saw her daughter's bleeding leg, they told her it had already been cleaned up. I then informed them that was definitely not the case; glass was still all over the mats. This is a play place where kids are required to wear socks only. One child was already bleeding, and that was the staff’s response? A few of us parents started using toys to barricade off the area because the glass had spread over a large area. There was no urgency from the staff; they eventually came over with brooms and said, ""It's not our fault people keep breaking our windows."" True, it’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to maintain a safe environment for the kids.

Despite our concerns, the girls wanted to keep playing, so we kept them away from that area. The staff’s cleaning efforts were inadequate—they didn’t even bother to get a vacuum to clean up the shards of glass on the mats. They removed our barricades. It wasn’t until the owner arrived later that the staff finally brought out a shop vac and sealed the window to clean up the glass properly. Yet, the owner never checked in with my friend to see how her daughter was doing.

When our kids got hungry, we ordered food: one large pizza and an order of chicken spring rolls. The food took a long time to arrive. When I bit into the spring rolls, I found a triangular piece of bone inside the chopped chicken. I took multiple pictures as proof. Then I noticed a rash on my friend’s daughter, which hadn’t been there before. That was the last straw; we decided it was time to go.

This place is a disaster—the staff is terrible, and there’s zero regulation on older kids roughhousing. An older boy, maybe 8-10 years old, was grabbing my daughter’s hands in the ball pit, and I had to intervene calmly. No parents were in sight.

When you go to a play place, there’s an expectation of cleanliness, kindness, and safety—this place has none of those. To top it off, only one sink in the women’s bathroom worked, the paper towel dispenser handle was broken, one toilet was out of order, and another was clogged. The toys, like the large Legos and the balls, were filthy, and even my daughter mentioned that the slides were dirty.

We had to explain to our girls that we were leaving because it wasn’t safe—between the broken glass, the bone in my food, and the rash, it was time to go and never come back. I’ve mentioned this experience to other mom friends, and they all had horrible things to say about this place. I have no idea how this place is still open; it needs to be shut down.

Review: This place is RIDICULOUS! 1. They are very intrusive and want to collect all of your personal information. Who knows where they are selling it.
2. They charge for grandparents & handicap people who are not there to play. They force elderly and handicap people to buy socks and tickets when they just want to sit and watch their grandkids play.
3. OVER priced for the small space kids have to play. The kids get bored with such limited things to do.

No 👎🏻 thanks. They will be out of business soon.

Go to a trampoline park. It's a much better value and kids will have more to do. Plus you won't get knocked over the head with charges just to watch your own kids....

It is obviously not well maintained at all.  Dirty, and SO many games broken but not marked as such.  Dropped a lot of coins that got us nothing.  Adult pricing seems excessive and to have to buy their socks - though I was sitting at a table the whole time seemed foolish.
Their listing should boldly state their shoes/ socks policy.
Their house keeping needs a royal step up and their employees need to learn some manners.  Disappointing.

Review: Went there for the first time today. Admission is reasonable. Cashier in the front didn’t give us wrist bands so that made leaving confusing. Food was pricey but decent, took almost an hour before we got our food and partially due to them not properly putting phone number in for text notification. Kids had a lot of fun though. I feel like there should be staff walking through checking on kids cause it is a big area and to try to keep balls in their areas as it is a tripping hazard. This area is so big you can lose a kiddo and if they don’t actually check wristbands/neglect to give them then I feel this could be a major safety hazard. I do like that you have unlimited play time though unlike other places we have gone to.

Review: Had a very uncomfortable experience here. Came here with my son my sister and nephew on Memorial Day the man that checked us in gave me a really hard time because we wanted to pay separately instead of together to avoid the additional $7.95 charge for an adult. He made me put my son’s water cup in the dirty shoe bin because water was “not allowed.” Upon entering I noticed water canteens on almost every table so I went back and brought this to his attention where he then gave me my son’s water cup back. Very strange. I’m 7 months pregnant and wanted to take my son to do something fun and in turn I come here just to feel super stressed out and uncomfortable by a grumpy employee. Super disappointing. Bathrooms are completely disgusting as well, brown on the walls in the stall. So it seems that the staff was concerned with my son’s water bottle than anything else! There’s a Wally Wombats not far from this place, way cleaner and friendly customer service.

Review: I can’t comment on their playground because I didn’t get inside. My issue was with their policy on charging adults. I arrived with friends, each accompanied by their own child. When we were asked if we came together, I said yes and offered to pay for everyone, expecting my friends to reimburse me later. Despite each adult having their own child and us all signing waivers, they insisted on charging me for four adults simply because we arrived as a group. I questioned why we had to pay extra when they weren’t providing any additional care for our kids. They replied it was their policy for group arrivals. Frustrated, I requested a refund and went to Kangamoo at Sunset instead.

Review: The positives - The staff were very friendly. The place is large with a good layout.

The negatives - The posted food menu did not match what the cashier was ringing up and she could not change it to match without being up charged.  Waited 45 minutes for a quesadilla and chicken sandwich.  The bathroom was disgusting and we arrived near opening so it was not restocked from the night before or cleaned.  Leaking toilets while wearing socks, there are sandals but no sign if for public use so was unsure who's they were.  The machines for the kids to use in the play area were broken or lacking power to where the balls would not shoot out or power up.  The games seemed expensive, $1 for 2 tokens.

Overall I'd say it was ok.  If they maintained the broken items and cleaned better it would be a five star.

Review: We went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't crazy busy, which I was happy about. It's a very large play place, and sometimes, when it's too busy, the little ones get hurt/run over by older kids. All the kids, for the most part, appeared to be under 6 when I was there.  The jungle gym is big enough that a parent is able to climb through it as well. Seemed pretty clean, didn't go to the restrooms which I hate because you're in socks only. They have some arcade games, but after spending $18 to get in, it can get expensive playing games. The birthday space I wasn't impressed with simply because it's all linked together in one large room.  Just rows of tables, maybe 10 - 15, so you don't have a personal space. You're behind glass separated from the general public, but not from anyone else having a birthday party at the same time. There's plenty of seating available for parents while the kids play, and the snack bar has a nice variety of items. Pricing wise they're high, but it's a play place so I expected it. It was almost $7 for a small slurpee (6 or 8oz I believe) and bottle of water.  The air guns in the playpen weren't working and there are several of them. Looked like no one had checked them to see because balls were stuck in them that weren't intended for the guns. I wasn't able to pull them out, and even guns that had nothing stuck in them weren't working either. Overall, my daughter enjoyed herself so I'd definitely go back.

Review: The facility itself is super nice and our kids had a great time- my issue was with the staff. Parents bring their young kids to these places and are paying for a pleasant experience and outing. Right when we walked in my 3 year old son saw a shark he wanted, so at the end of our trip we went to the arcade to try to win tickets. He was closing in on nap time, so we went to the front to get the shark toy, and we were 30 tickets short. He had a full on meltdown and i asked the staff lady if i could just pay the difference and she told me to go back in to win 30 more tickets. With two toddlers this is sort of unreasonable so i asked again if i can just pay for it as he was almost to the point of vomiting in the entry of the building. She just watched as he freaked out over this shark and literally no staff said anything just sorry we can’t do anything. Any normal business catering to2-3 year old children would know kids may want a toy at the end and have waived the 30 ticket difference or just allowed me to buy the $2 shark for my son. It made a fun experience an awful one for myself and my toddler. Know your audience people.

Review: I love this place honestly. It's a little pricey when it comes to birthdays but that's because they do the whole decoration. They do a digital background for your daughter or your son. That also comes with pizza drinks
if you go to different places and check those prices it's about the same or less here . My daughter is scared of chuck e cheese. So we come here now! As long as my daughter isn't scared, that's all that matters to me. Their food is actually pretty good.They just got those bougie cakes.I've been seeing everybody buy. They just installed a new arcade as well. It's great They have a few different games for the littles to play on . It's one of those little cars with the camera so you can ride along and get your picture taken while having a blast. they also have a picture booth in the building .. the lady that does the party planning is so awesome. When nobody came for my son's birthday, she had Wally come out for free and take pictures with the kids! When we had my daughter's birthday there, it was a blast Everybody showed up and they still gave us a card for a free visit but come back!

We take her here when visiting Vegas and especially during the summer heat so she can run around and play! It’s so nice having a place where she can grow and explore her blossoming physical abilities! Both locations are great and the front desk staff has always been super sweet and helpful! We also love that we can leave and come! Parents concerned about older kids being around their littles, try taking your littles to the toddler time from 9-12 Monday to Friday! And avoid weekends if possible!

Review: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Fun for Kids, Stress-Free for Parents!

Wally Wombats in Henderson is an absolute gem for families with young kids! The play area is super clean, well-maintained, and packed with fun activities like climbing structures, slides, and soft play zones that keep kids entertained for hours. There's a nice toddler area too, so little ones can play safely.

The staff is friendly and attentive, and the whole place feels secure, which gives parents peace of mind. There’s a café inside with snacks, coffee, and decent seating for adults to relax while the kids run wild.

It’s also a great spot for birthday parties — they’re organized and take care of everything, so you don’t have to stress.

Highly recommend for playdates, rainy day outings, or just burning off some kid energy indoors

Review: Went on a Saturday Evening and it definitely got busy, but it did not feel too crowded. Indoor playground was spacious and had many things to do for my two year old son. Would definitely go again, and would probably host a birthday party there.

What's inside?
- Huge ball-pit area + interactive projected screen
- Playground/jungle gym thing with swings, a large slide, obstacle courses, and guns that actually shoot the balls (unlike Uptown Jungle where the guns did not work)
- Party Rooms; decently sized and much colder compared to main area, and could fit around 20 people.
- Food area (didn't order myself but the party had pizzas, fries and drinks)
- Arcade area; I didn't personally check it out but it looked like a decent size.

My only ""complaint"" is that it was a bit warm in there, but I understand as it was a large space and must be difficult to keep cool. Also the restrooms could have been cleaner.

Staff was kind, had no issues.

If you have a baby or toddler, I highly recommend bringing them when the older kids are at school so they don’t get accidentally run over in all the excitement.  The facility is clean and well managed so even my VERY particular husband was impressed (he didn’t want me bringing the baby here at first).  I love the quiet room off to the side so I could give baby a break and nurse when needed.

Review: I took my two kids here, 3 and 1, and both really enjoyed it.  We came early in the morning on a school day so there were no problem of ""big kids.""  They loved going up and and down the giant and small slide.  My little one liked the swings and merry go around.  My 3 year old liked hitting the screen by the ball pit with the balls for their video game activity.  It tired her out.  The space was really fun for an hour or two but then it does get a little repetitive.

This is a fun place to visit when the weather doesn't allow for outside play and kids need to get out.  But weekday mornings are probably best.

The service was lacking.  I was trying to find the Aldi nearby and asked the staff there and they told me how to get there but failed to tell me that it wasn't open yet.  So I took my 2 kids all the way over to Aldi's only to find out that they're still under renovation.  That was a fun walk for everyone after two hours running around at Wally Wombat's.  A little heads up like, ""hey last we heard it wasn't open yet."" would have been awesome.

Review: Came free because the Pogo Pass, and even that feel it robbed 😒. Too small, kids get bored fast. We bought the cards for the machines and it's a robbery, the machine for stuffed animals are rugged, 0 chance to win, when other playgrounds let the kids win no matter how many tries (Kids Empire), tooo expensive, then a machine suck all the momey from the card.  But 0 as experience

Woman at reception needs a raise! No desire to work or drogged. Stuff very rude

Review: Kidstopia is okay...

Pros: I liked the variety of play structures for the kids such as the bounce house, slide, spinning globe & Merry-Go-Round swings. They have a comfortable seating area with vending machines & massage chairs for parents. They have a large party room, that's great for birthdays and the staff was cleaning throughout the party to keep the area clean.

Cons- lots of broken games. Most games don't have ""out of order signs"" over the token slots so, kiddos are frustrated with machines. Some machines that ""work"" are missing buttons so you can't select different options. The token machine was out of order in the back with a broken foosball table.... making it confusing where to get tokens (At the front desk)?  The little swing sets have twine rope holding the swings together, I don't think it's sturdy enough for play (an accident waiting to happen).

Overall it's okay, but it's not Wally Wombats.

Review: Coming here was our grandson's choice, as he had been here once with his mom. The name has changed since then, to the current name , ""Kid's Topia.""

At first look, he was happily entertained, but after viewing so many broken toys and arcade games that we had spent money on, with no refunds, I can't recommend this place outside of a safe area for 5 and under to play.

The arcade games that work, I'd say, are geared for 6 and up, some older.  I guess they're trying to appeal to families with older and younger kids, to inculde them all.

The attendent was kind and kept on top of keeping the area sanitized and toys organized.

Lastly, the bathrooms were clean and brightly colored with fresh painted colors and equipment.

They have a nice couch sitting area for adults and snacks or lunches to bring in. Towels or something to clean the tables would be appreciated.

My three star rating was for safety and cleanliness, with two stars removed for broken arcades and equipment, with the no refund policy on tokens. My husband reminded me that it was about our grandson's enjoyment and that he had fun with another little boy he played with, so it was worth it.

Review: My family recently visited Kids Topia in South Durango, Las Vegas, and it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. From the moment we stepped through the doors, we were greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that immediately put us at ease.

One of the standout aspects of Kids Topia is the wonderful experience it offers for children. The facility is thoughtfully designed with a variety of engaging and stimulating activities that cater to children of all ages. From colorful play structures to imaginative play areas, there was something for every child to enjoy.

The staff at Kids Topia are truly exceptional. They are not only friendly and approachable but also highly professional and attentive to the needs of the children.

Speaking of safety, I was impressed by the security measures in place at Kids Topia. The facility is always locked, providing an added layer of security for peace of mind. Additionally, the cleanliness standards are impeccable, with a strict shoes-off policy that helps to maintain a hygienic environment for children to play in.

He also gives me the creeps. Being in his presence is unpleasant. You get a sense of...wrongness from him.

That's separate and apart from the fact that he's still wearing a mask in 2023.

Hand sanitizer is mandatory at this place. They're going to squirt some of that poison on your kids' hands whether you like it or not.

I found out before they tried. Before I even paid, actually.

That's good. If I'd paid and had to leave, I wouldn't have liked that result. If they'd tried to pump that poison onto my kids' hands, they wouldn't have liked the result.

My son is 17 months and there was plenty for him to do as well as toys for older children. The basketball hoop entertained my husband as well, while I played with our son 😂 friendly staff, price is about the same as other indoor play grounds however this one has all day play! You can step out and grab lunch then come right back and enjoy more play time , no extra cost . Definitely worth the drive for me as I don’t live close to this one. Will be back for sure

I said that I would look after my eldest daughter, and he would be in a stroller at 9 months old  and will not play, this playground is not suitable for his age. They insisted that we buy socks from them for the baby, I did not agree.and we stayed on the street with the baby and they didn’t let us in, I will never bring my daughter here again.

Review: My 5 year olds rating A+++, i mean they have a trampoline and a jumper, you can’t beat that.
Mom’s rating, D-. There was a lot of really big kids and the place is really small so crashing into the little ones and being bullies of course, i didn’t like that. It’s not as clean as other places  I’ve visited either. It smelled like feet so much, and it was extremely loud. For being on that side of town it was really ghetto.
The other place we usually go to was closed so it is what it is.

It doesn't look like a lot compared to other indoor playgrounds, but that didn't stop them from running around non stop for almost three hours. One of the gentlemen there had a small drone that he flew around for the girls to chase. That was great! There are cute, unusual arcade games for older kids. We'll definitely be back.

The gentlemen working there was very attentive to his job and even engaged with the kids which was very rare to see. Just the right amount too. Not to mention he was very sweet and to the point with our first introduction to the place. There was a moment when I thought one of the arcade games wasnt working but it's just that it was very quiet, still, he gave me another coin to start over. I go to many different indoor playgrounds and this one makes the mark. Not to mention the pass is all day?! Yeah. Def amazing.

Review: First I have to say that the arcade play was ok. Right after that we went to the playground I took my 2 old daughter there the thing I didn't like was that my daughter got hit about 4 times there where kids there none of there parents where looking at them.  The other area where there suppose to be 3 years and younger there was older kids therethat was over 3 years old which these kids where rough. I thinks parents should looking at there kids at all times. There was some staff walking around and they didn't say anything about the older kids that where in the 3 and under section where the balls are at and slide. Im just saying to the family's that go there I found out that in the morning its better to take your toddler instead in the afternoon. In the morning they have a toddler only from a certain time. I think the staff should be more responsible what they see if thr company is enforcing the rules. Going back there again yes I would go but only in the morning.

Review: Wally Wombats is hands down one of the most delightful and family-friendly indoor playgrounds I’ve ever visited. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that feels like a breath of fresh air for parents and an absolute wonderland for kids. The space is immaculately clean, thoughtfully designed, and bursting with creative energy—it's clear the team behind Wally Wombats truly cares about making every visit a memorable experience.

The play structures are incredible—colorful, safe, and engaging for a wide range of ages. My kids could have stayed for hours exploring the climbing walls, tunnels, and slides, while the soft play areas are perfect for little ones who are just learning to crawl and walk. I especially appreciate the attention to safety: the staff keeps a watchful eye on the play zones, and everything from the flooring to the equipment feels high-quality and well-maintained.

What really sets Wally Wombats apart, though, is the heart behind it. The staff is exceptional—kind, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about creating a positive environment. They go above and beyond to ensure families feel welcome and supported, whether it’s helping with a birthday party setup or offering a friendly smile when you need a coffee break. Speaking of which, the café area is a fantastic touch! It’s a cozy space where parents can relax while the kids play, and the menu has plenty of options that make it easy to refuel without leaving the building.

Wally Wombats is also an incredible spot for hosting parties and special events. Their team takes care of the details so you can actually enjoy the day with your family, and they make every celebration feel special and unique.

Whether you're looking for a safe, engaging place for your kids to burn off energy or a welcoming community space for families to connect, Wally Wombats delivers in every way. It’s a gem in the community, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. If you’re in the area, do yourself and your family a favor—come experience the magic of Wally Wombats!

Only downside was they didn’t let us use the bikes. The staff said it was too crowded but honestly, it didn’t feel that way. We didn’t try the food or drinks so can’t comment on that. Overall, a fun spot- we’ll probably be back!

Review: Always an amazing place and staff!!!

Update 05.13.2023
I am still a fan if this place wally wombats.

However, the previous 2 times wasn't such a great experience.
What happened to the great staff that was there??
The current  staff is a bit snippy and half do their job, too many people in the front making it difficult to get situated with kids and shoes.
I ordered fries that were full of grease and soggy and still white!!!! That upsets me because the guy knew that. Why aren't employees  taking pride in their work.
If they wouldn't eat it like that, why would they have someone else to do so.

Other than that it's ok..minor adjustments should be considered.

Also not being able to bring your food in is a game changer especially little snacks for babies.
But I can deal with that!!

Review: This place used to be so amazing. They stopped with therapy then turned it into an arcade. The staff here is rude at times. It seems like it lost the purpose of what wally wombat used to be. A place where kids were respected and valued and mostly cared for. This is just a dark dimmed playground now. My kids like the indoor playground because this is where they started their therapies. It became like a second home. Now the price to even play has gone up so much and also most of the staff just has an icky face towards childre. Like why even hire people like that. Another issue, it happens a lot ... when trying to get our bucket up front our profile 'doesn't show up"" so I have to go and re do the waiver again and again. It saddens me how this place was so amazing for kids is rotten bit by bit!

Review: For starters, my kids had a BLAST. I had my son’s 1st birthday here. I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning

It is easy for small children to keep an eye on and play with it.
The staff is always there and the doors are locked, so you don't have to worry about people escaping, and the risk level is low, which is good.
I feel like it's just the right size to play for about two hours.

There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!

Review: It was pretty cool except for the managers /person running the place on 10/29 in the morning son.
My 1 year old daugher went exploring into the bounce house and this 5 or 6 year old boy went inside it literally jumping on top of her stepping on her on purpose. We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.
My daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.

Otherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.

Review: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)

The party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here.

Review: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂

Review: We had the best experience having our daughter’s 4th birthday party here this past Saturday!! Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!

The owner and the young lady on duty were super helpful in answering all questions, decorating the room, blowing up balloons, and with cleaning up after the party ended.
Highly recommend this playground for birthdays and play time.

Review: We love Kidstopia. The owner Loucas and his employees are so friendly and so hospitable. Our daughter’s birthday party was a success. There was even ample room to have Pose Party Post set up a braid bar for the girls. The kids had so much fun and could not get enough of the claw machine there. The parents that came were able sit back and relax knowing their kids were in sight and safe.
They set up the party room too which is such a huge help! Overall, just a nice establishment to be able to support.

The carpet is like brand new, the play equipment is in perfect condition, staff are very friendly and helpful, my little girl loves it here. Party room is big and spacious and beautifully decorated and again spotless. I am really impressed with Kidstopja and highly recommend it to children of all ages. It’s the only play center my child goes to and doesn’t end up sick the next day thanks to how clean and hygienic the place is. Well done to the owners of Kidstopia.

Review: VIP Family Indoor Play and More is a gem for both kids and parents! My kids love it, and honestly, I do too. Friends and family have given it a solid 10/10, and my out-of-state relatives always ask to visit when they’re in town. The events are top-tier, and the owners are incredibly kind, generous, and welcoming. The space is spotless, fun for the kids, and surprisingly relaxing for parents. It’s also a perfect co-working spot—bring your laptop, and you’ll be set!

The best part? There are no blind spots, so I can always keep an eye on my kiddos without worry. They even allow outside food and drinks, which is a game-changer. Everything you need to know about events and open play is super clear on their website and flyers, so you’ll always know what to expect. Definitely recommend this place to any parent!

There are security measures to avoid little kids getting out by themselves. The owner is super nice and helpful, and so is the staff.  The whole area is super clean.

The owner is very responsive thru instagram and calls for all the my questions and concerns and that is a plus, this place suites for everyone all ages. I was overwhelmed with how they prepared the place for us, every dollar i paid for was worth it.

Review: Our family has found sheer joy and excitement here every time we visit. It's become our favorite spot for our little one's adventures. From the moment we walk in, the vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff make us feel right at home.

The impressive array of toys available keeps our little explorer engaged for hours on endplay and when she's old enough the structure im sure will be a hit too, offering a perfect blend of exploration and play.

One thing that caught our eye is the private-party rooms. They exude warmth and charm, and we can't wait to host a special celebration there. The attention to detail is remarkable, ensuring every event is unforgettable.

Even though we haven't experienced one of their private events yet, we're eagerly anticipating it. The thought of celebrating amidst such a lively and welcoming atmosphere is incredibly enticing.

In summary, if you're seeking an indoor playground that ticks all the boxes for kids and parents alike, look no further than VIPKids Indoor Play & More - It's a haven where laughter fills the air, friendships are formed, and memories are made.

Review: VIPKids lives up to its name.  The moment you walk in, the staff greets you warmly and is really attentive throughout. Not only does our family enjoy the daily play but also birthday parties and special events hosted by VIPkids, which are now our favorite! My toddler has a blast running around in the safety of the play area while we enjoy karaoke and game consoles in their upscale party rooms that look out to the play area. They have designated play pens for babies that give me peace of mind.

The owners are fun, engaging, and truly passionate about catering to everyone’s unique events, letting you get as creative as you’d like and making you feel like family. For events, they are with you every step of the planning process - from amazing balloon arches to piñatas, and personalized center pieces they help bring your vision to life. 10/10 would recommend for all ages and family events!

Review: There’s good and bad about this place. The reason I rated it three stars is due to the price being so high for an indoor playground verses what you get. 18.50 for one kid. The siblings is 16.50. It amounted to 36 something. The pass is for the entire day, but since it’s only the size of an office space I think it’s a stretch for the average family to stay more than a few hours. (My kids 3 & 5 wanted to finish up within 1 hour.) It’s a small, family owned playground (owner was very nice and gave a lollipop to each kid.)
on the way out) I’ve been to almost all the indoor playgrounds in Vegas, some very well put together that charge less. They have motorized cars that are basically useless since they do not have the battery and cannot be driven. My kids were asking multiple times to get them to work, which I of course couldn’t. I don’t see the point of having two enticing cars that cannot drive in that space. The basketball area was a great addition that my boys enjoyed. The bathrooms weren’t super cleanly. Out of two bathrooms one of the doors lock didn’t work. It would probably benefit the business to have another employee on hand to tidy the space a bit. The actual play set is fairly small. They did have comfy couches and lots of floor toys. Ultimately, If the price was more reasonable I wouldn’t be as harsh. I feel other play places you pay less for more. I wish the owner well though and hope they can grow their business over time.

Review: An absolute gem! VIP kids offers a diverse range of activities for all ages, including indoor play ground, board games, toys, air hockey, basketball, karaoke and video games. Impeccably clean and staffed with friendly faces, it's a haven for families. Kids enjoyed the playground and the activities, while the rest of the family rocked out to karaoke and battled it out on video games. A perfect blend of fun and entertainment for everyone!

Review: From the moment we stepped into VIP Kids Indoor Play & More, Jasmine, the owner, welcomed us with such warmth and enthusiasm that we instantly felt like part of the VIP family. Her dedication to creating a vibrant and engaging environment for children is evident in every corner of the meticulously maintained facility, filled with a variety of fun and educational activities designed for kids of all ages. Jasmine's passion doesn't stop at the decor; she is actively involved in every event, ensuring each child and parent has a memorable experience.

The highlight of our visit was the costume party, a testament to Jasmine's commitment to providing extraordinary family experiences. She was there, engaging with parents and children alike, orchestrating games, handing out prizes, and even joining in the fun, which added a personal touch that made the event even more special. Seeing Jasmine interact with families, including my children and myself, highlighted how much she cares about fostering a community where children can safely play, learn, and grow.

What truly sets VIP Kids apart, under Jasmine's stewardship, is the sense of community and joy it fosters among families. Jasmine's attentive, friendly approach and her genuine passion for enriching children's lives shine through, making every visit feel personal and unique. The three hours of gameplay, laughter, and bonding flew by, leaving us all eagerly anticipating our next visit.

In conclusion, VIP Kids Indoor Play & More, under Jasmine's loving guidance, is more than just an indoor play center; it's a haven of happiness and growth for families. Her welcoming presence, along with the center's fantastic offerings, ensures that every family leaves with cherished memories and a longing to return.

Review: We celebrated my son turning 4 at VIP Kids. While the place was fine and the kids had fun, the customer service was non existent. We paid for a two hour party (2:30-4:30), but the employee was telling me 40 minutes before the party ended that I had to be out by 4:30. So I had to stop hosting to start packing everything up… before my event ever ended?

We have done an indoor playground for 3 birthday parties now and this was by far the worst experience we’ve had. The employees offered no assistance and rushed us out while having the next party people waiting in the lobby before our party ended.
Lastly, when booked they said that we would pay the deposit at that time and pay the remainder at the end of the party. Upon arrival they required payment before the party started.
Overall not a great experience and would not do a party there again.

Review: This place does definitely not resemble their name. They do NOT make you feel like a VIP.  Management needs a lesson in customer service. This is not a good place to spend your money.  That is all they care about. It’s basically one small room with a very small place area. I saw no video games. They are so small that if they have a private party that is all they can accommodate. They will ask u to leave. They are closed on Sunday which is crazy! They require everyone, including handicapped adults” to remove shoes and have soaks on. Even to sit on the couch. If u challenge them on anything they are rude to u. There are much nicer kid play areas in Las Vegas than this one to spend your money at. This place will not make it long. I have more toys in my back yard than they have at this place.

After reading the owner or managers response to my review. I’m editing my message. I would actually love for them to post the video of me going in there. Because that is not how things transpired.   When I walk in I ask about the hours and the cost to play. The girls at the front tell me That they are having a private party in 20 minutes and will be closing to the public. She said I should have called, but that I could fill out there forms and have a tour and a look around to check things out.
I also mentioned that I would’ve called if my comment on her post had been responded to. Because It wasn’t I couldn’t find the post so I didnt remember the name or address. I proceeded to drive around the area trying to find it. I did not know their phone number or their name and I was looking for the original post so that I could call.
Yes, I was with the teenager and a one-year-old. They are my grandchildren. Yes, my one-year-old sat on toy car while I was reading their pricelist , took their tour which last about 3 minutes because it’s one tiny room,  I then took an important phone call. While i let my granddaughter , whom we had removed her shoes as requested so she could see if she was going to like it there , go check out the toys. Then I was Approached and asked to leave. I had been there maybe five minutes !!! Them saying I let my grandbaby play there is a stretch. She sat on a little toy car !! I was trying to see this was going to be something she would like to do. When I told the girl, I thought you said we had 20 minutes  She said , yeah we have to clean for the party. I was more than willing to pay for 20 minutes. Mind you. But they didn’t give me a price for that!!
I said ok fine. And we got ready to leave! She said I Stormed off? I walked out the door!! Yes that’s true My 16 year old grandson was getting his sister and putting her shoes on. That is because I am handicapped and I can  not lift her! how is it storming off???
I am in so many parenting groups that I will tell every single one of them not to take their kids there. I have never ever ever been treated so rudely in my life. I have worked in customer care for 35 years!  none of my friends are going to be interested in taking their kid to a place where if they have one party, they cannot accommodate anybody else.  It is literally one room with two little side closets. One where they sit down and have pizza and one where they have a little karaoke. There’s nothing there for teenagers. My teenager grandson said that he would not want to stay there at all ever for anything. And like I said, I have more toys in my backyard than they had in that place. not to mention you do not speak to potential customers like that.  Just how much do you think I should’ve paid for my grandbaby to sit in a toy car for a minute?  I truly am curious how u treat children if this is how u treat their parents . Your business will be gone in a year. Unless it’s a money laundering business. .

Review: I brought my three kids here ranging from ages 9 to 2 years old and I was impressed with the cleanliness and variety of things to do for all ages! my 9 year old went straight to the video games and my 7 year old started playing with the variety of toys that were there and my 2 year old went to the playground. That was the first time I was able to set up my laptop and get some work done while all three kids were entertained. I highly recommend this place to every parent! The staff was very welcoming and friendly and I appreciated that they took the safety and rules seriously because I have been to indoor kid's playgrounds where it was a mad house. Awesome place and I will be reaching out to get my Daughter's party planned there as well!

I work a lot and I love bringing my 2 year old here to socialize while I get some work done on my laptop . I also enjoy their tables where I can pack a snack to enjoy with my little guy . And they sell all the snacks he loves !!! Such a great idea thank you for opening in the northwest .

Review: Awesome place to have a party! Everything is very clean and the party/karaoke  rooms are cute and modern. The owners are awesome and are willing to accommodate how you want the place set up for the private bookings. Pricing is fair with a huge variety of things you can add on if you wish (even a Photo Booth!) Also they let you bring in your own food and drinks so you aren't limited in what you can serve. It was great having a party at place that was safe enough for the little kids to roam wild and free but still had a cute vibe and things to entertain the bigger kids and adults. Definitely recommend!

Review: My son loves VIP kids. Because of that, we decided to do his 3rd birthday party there, construction themed. We chose the package where decorations, tableclothes, plates/utensils, and drinks were included. We felt that the price was very fair for what we got. The kids loved the play area, the video games and karaoke. There is plenty of tables and comfy couches for the adults to be comfortable and socialize. The owner is very accommodating and texted often with updates. We appreciate the personal touch of the decorations. I recommend VIP kids for single day passes and birthday parties!

Review: Fun place for my 4 year old and 18 month old and it can keep them busy for hours! We mostly like to play outside in the summers but we love that they have a trampoline we can use and lots of things to climb on. It keeps my kids entertained and they love it here. I've been here a few times and I actively watch them and follow them to make sure they are safe and I personally think it is gross. Staff are teenagers that aren't very friendly and play on their phones the entire time. The 3 times I've been there I saw someone ""clean"" once. The girl just sprayed benches people weren't sitting on without wiping them down which isn't really cleaning. I also never personally saw them clean the playground. I don't know what their cleaning expectations are but I've been to other indoor playgrounds before I moved here that had employees go into the play area every hour with spray and cloths to wipe down the equipment and it always smelled clean. We will go here again most likely but I wish their staff would actually work and make the place a clean and friendly atmosphere like I'm sure the owners expect them and pay them to do.

Review: Nice and well sized indoor playground for kids. The kids played for about an hour and a half before they were ready to go. We've been twice and both times other kids closed off parts of the playground and wouldn't let other kids in or stole all of the balls etc., talking to other parents, the kids, staff etc isn't really worth it.

Review: Overall the place was just ok. The ball pit was non functional, no ball cannons,  which was a bigger play area kinda outta commission. Also there are balloons stuck on the ceiling that have either popped or deflated long ago and just for looks should be cleaned up. The play areas did seem fairly clean but some maintenance could be done. While it didn't feel unsafe it felt very worn.

Review: My kids loved this place. There is lots for them to do here. My kids are ages 6-11, and they are the perfect age for this place. It might be a bit much if your kids are younger than that. Especially if you go on a busy day like spring break. If you take your toddler age kids, it's pretty likely you will find yourself climbing up the big toy to save your lost and scared kid 😂.

The worst thing about this place is the layout. I was there on a busy day, and all the seating for the parents at the front were full, so we had to sit on the side in the back. Which made it hard to watch for our kids, this resulted in one of my friends kids going outside in a panic looking for him. 🤦🏼‍♂️ We had no idea until some other mom there found him and brought him back in and helped him find us. After that we just had to stand up in the front till some seating cleared up.

Review: Our experience with Coconut Cove was terrible from beginning to end. We booked a birthday party there for our 6 year old and some of his friends. The play equipment was not clean and there were a few areas that seemed unsafe, some holes in the netting, etc. The party attendees, including the birthday boy, left feeling pretty let down by the lack of rule enforcement and general mayhem. When trying to address these issues, we couldn't find a single adult employee to address these concerns. There were a few tennage-aged employees who didn't seem to know what was going on.

The real kicker in all of this, is that after we checked out with the front desk and left, they later had trouble running our card for the remaining balance due, which resulted in the owner reporting us to the Centerville Police for theft. After speaking with a police detective, we (ofcourse) paid the unpaid invoice. Needless to say, we won't ever be back to Coconut Cove again.

Employee walked around 3 times in 2 hrs carrying a spray bottle and garbage in visible site still did not get picked up.  Grandchild cleaned up some of the garbage in the area where they were playing.  Things look pretty worn down.  Torn paper on walls, unsafe back areas that kids could get into.

Review: Fun place to take the kids when the weather is not so inviting.  There is a huge, multilevel playground inside with obstacles and slides galore.  It’s a children’s indoor paradise!  The admission price is decent at first glance BUT it is for an unlimited amount of time…so take advantage of it!  With that said, kids get hungry when they are running around.  Coconuts cove does allow you to bring water inside.  They have some cheap, healthy snacks for purchase to help keep the little ones going.  For birthdays, it is a great place too.

It’s my mess and I’m fine cleaning it up but they didn’t even help keep kids off that area or anything. Didn’t move a finger. I guess that why it feels dirty there.

Review: I thought this was really fun for the kids! I wish I was smaller or had this place when I was younger. There are so many fun activities to do within the play area. Things that spin, shoot little foam balls, to swing on, to slide on, to climb on. I went as an invitee to my nephew's birthday party that was hosted by Coconut Cove. They supplied pizza. Our party had 4 of them. They brought out 1, then 2 more after a while, and 1 more again a bit after that. It was strange that only a small number of people were able to eat at a time. I'm not sure on cost. I didn't have to pay anything to enter as part of the party.

Review: Came here for the first time with my daughter for a birthday party. While playing my daughter was pushed down on the trampoline multiple times. This child then sat on my daughter after I told him not to do that and scratched her face. His parents were not around so I informed an employee who told me all they could do was tell the child not to do it (but not until another employee came to cover her at the desk) and that it was up to the parents to make sure kids are not acting that way. This is not acceptable. If a child is hurting other children staff should be allowed to ask them to leave. My daughter has visible scratch marks on her face where the child broke skin as well as a rug burn from when he pushed her from behind on the trampoline. We will not be returning.

Review: The kids love it. We bought the punch pass so we never question the cost when they ask to go. It took us 1.75 years to use it because the kids don’t love that it’s far away for us (almost 25 minutes). They don’t ask to go often. But it has been a great tool in the tool belt to keep them busy in the summer, on a rainy day, or when I need a break. It keeps them entertained. We also got a similar place closer and plenty of parks and museums, but this one helps us mix things up now and then despite being farther. It’s nice to be able to relax while they play in a safe environment.

Review: My daughter was invited to a birthday party and I expected it to be super loud like previous places we had been to. I was pleasantly surprised to find the noise level wasn't what I expected. It's a big jungle gym with mazes, bouncers, balls, and slides. It dawned on me that there were no fans going as there were no massive blow-up toys. The kids had fun, and the parents could visit without yelling over massive fans going. I would say it was a good experience.

Review: There were some fun activities for my older kiddo, but the overall feel was kind of dirty. The floors were gray, and the baby area was not very appropriate for my crawling baby. The floors were covered in crumbs and other garbage, which he naturally tried putting in his mouth. There was also like a giant soft toy the size of the wall in there that was easy for a baby to pull up on and have topple on them. There were honestly mostly older children playing in that section, even though it's only for babies. I understand that's the parent's job to watch, but I would recommend a better enclosure or something like maybe a baby gate or something? There was just a large soft block in place of a door, but my crawling baby kept climbing over it instead of playing with the other toys so I had to just stand next to him the whole time ensuring he didn't go over head first and hit his head. If it were more secure I could have at least sat down at the table right next to the baby zone instead of hovering. The other thing is that it's super difficult to see inside the play place. If parents aren't really supposed to be in there with their kids but are to watch their kids, there really needs to be some way to observe what is going on. There were multiple times I lost track of my son for several minutes just because of the layout. Maybe adding in mirrors or something to make it easier to see what is going on would make it a less stressful experience.
I think there is great potential. I love the idea of this place. I think people should support it, and hopefully management will continue to make improvements so our kids will keep having a fun indoor space to play.

Review: My kids  ( 5 and 9) both loved this place and have been begging to come back again. Even all the adults seemed be enjoying themselves and playing along. We arrived right when they opened on a Friday and by noon, the place was packed with people. It was pretty clean and I saw the one employee  wiping the play area and tables down frequently. Pretty much when she wasn't helping a customer in any way, she was cleaning. All these other reviews claiming it was dirty, I think they're just being over the top and expecting the place to look brand new and never touched, which is impossible. I did see the sit and spins that were mentioned in other reviews that had damaged padding on the corners. They were  still damaged when we went, but they didn't seem to be a safety hazard either. And all of the air guns didn't seem to be working, which was a bummer, but there's so much else to do in there so it wasn't too much of a disappointment. I would recommend grippy socks for sure after seeing many kids slip and fall in the cement flooring outside of the play area. And their pizzas are a little small, but they aren't bad for the price. They don't taste like a frozen pizza someone just tossed in the oven. We felt like we were eating a made from scratch pizza.

Review: Great set of activities and the kids burned off energy just fine but not without excessive risk. The only 2 employees I could identify (teenagers browsing Pandora together), could not be bothered to observe several kids running up the tall slides with their socks off, crashing into other kids with their socks off, causing them to cry. ""Do you guys police kids with their socks off running up the slides and crashing into other kids?"" ""We try to... (back to Pandora). Top 5 posted rules all broken. 1) Little to no parental supervision. 2) Socks not being worn by 25% of ALL kids everywhere. 3) Kids climbing up slides (en masse). 4) Rough play abounds. 5) Outside toys all over the place.

You have to do better, owners. I had to be overly vigilant and police other people's kids. If anyone has a lawsuit originating on 4/6/24 from 4:15-5:45 pm, let me know in will witness to the incompetence of the staff and the negligence of ownership.

My only critique is that because it goes so far back it’s almost impossible to watch your kid the whole time. And there are often other parents that aren’t watching their children so stuff could happen up in the play area and no adults would ever see it. Love the baby play area though! Great idea and great play set, would just love to see it separated or better view for parents towards the back to watch their kids.

Review: Such a fun place for all ages. 5 kids between the ages of 2-11 absolutely love it and are entertained for hours. The price is ridiculously high, though. They could cut prices in half and I think more people would go. $9.50 for 3+ to play on an indoor jungle gym is ridiculous, especially when you can play for free at Living Spaces if you need to shop for furniture or just look around.

Review: I'm gonna give the 2 teenagers working the benefit of the doubt but the 2 girls working were 1. Rude and 2. Very unhelpful. We had never been so I didn't know what to do first and with her airpods in on her phone she starred at me like I was stupid. Just unacceptable. Being human is hard so I get it. But I was extremely kind. We are gonna try the Orem location next time.

Review: Brought my 1 year old here today. Staff was nice but didn’t enforce kids to stay out of the crawling babies only area which is the only place my son could play. The facility looked super fun but it was dirty. Kids were eating in the structure and not wearing socks. We want to try again on a weekday when it’s not so busy with birthday parties.

Review: As a very sensitive person spiritually, the vibe and energy of this place did not sit well with me or my husband and friend. I felt sick the entire time I was there, once I left the property it’s like my soul could finally breathe and I felt better within 5 minutes. This place is super tiny too. The prices on their tvs for food and drinks are wrong as we got charged more than what was advertised on the screen even after we told the lady that it’s cheaper on the screen and got a reply of “oh well we haven’t changed it yet”….  Kidstopia and Hangtime is WAY better and has way better vibes/energy. This place felt like a daycare, the whole vibe was off. Wouldn’t recommend this place.

Review: When you enter it smells a lot like feet but that is expected cuz it’s a kids place with no shoes on. I have toddlers so it was a bit more difficult for me bc my daughter was scared of getting hurt and she wanted to go on a the toy wheel where it spins several kids but the same big kids kept spinning for like two hours they would bump the younger kids they would even bump into the fence with their body parts flying everywhere not caring who goes near them they should have more consideration for the others around them but that’s not the businesses fault but I felt maybe they need like a worker by that station just letting them know what’s safe and what’s not bc the three workers were just in the counter chit chatting and just signing people in when someone walked and the kids looked like wild animals a lot of screaming mostly the older ones cuz they would do things without looking where they were doing or going and it would cause accidents and clashing but the place itself they have a lot of fun sections for the kids to play the toddler section was nice too especially since I did notice that was a pretty safe area bc the older kids weren’t aloud on it!

When we got there, we were told it would be $12 for the parent with the kid free. When we tried to explain the discrepancy to staff, they looked at us like we were crazy. It’s a shame since this place is much closer than the new Big Green in Saratoga, but I guess we’ll have to make the drive from now on.

Review: I am only giving 4 stars cause it was a bit dark in some of the areas so it made it made it hard to see your kids. Overall it was really good ! Very reasonably priced and lots of variety of fun to be had. I brought my 1 yr old and the ball cannon sound did scare her and it is quite loud. I know it's fun but i don't think they are needed. Kids weren't even shooting the balls they were just doing it to scare the little kids and make noise. Loved that they had affordable grab and go snack options. The toddler area is a bit small but it seems a place geared for maybe 5 & up anyways. That being said I will definitely go back. Happy it wasn't busy.

Review: The last time we came in about November or December 2023 and it only cost $5 a kid for the entire day. This location is a ways out of our area, so it has been something I keep in the back of my mind if we're ever close by. The price has more than doubled, $10.50 now each kid no matter how long they play. 2 years old and younger play for free. I asked why the price doubled, but the girl at the front desk had only been working there a month and replied with 'inflation? I don't know when or why it changed. I'm just a teenager'. Lol

Update: Following the business' response, I realize I was relying on what my friend had said when referring me here--and confusion occurred about the price because I didn't know whether we had paid for parents or not. Please forgive the confusion! I've kept this review to 4 stars. Kids love it if you're in the area.

Review: 3 stars because though there are a lot of great things about it, the policies are just dumb. The staff was great, it was a fun place, pretty clean, and pretty good equipment - though it's not well lit, the drinking fountains were broken, and it was pretty cold inside. We had fun playing for my son's birthday party, but their party policies are unclear and confusing. Nowhere, when I booked the party (which includes entrance for 10 kids), did it say you can only arrive 5 minutes prior to the room reservation, which I didn't appreciate because I wanted to schedule the room for 5:00pm but couldn't because that wasn't an option (even though no one had the room booked before us) and we wanted to start the party then and play before eating pizza and cake at 6:00 (playing before eating, so kids don't get sick). It took several phone calls and convincing the manager to let us play before our room reservation (even though when we got there, there was almost no one else there). The website and signs on the door say ""No outside food or drink"", but then there is a place to eat food and the other guests I saw there were eating outside food, so it's stated everywhere but not enforced? For the party, we couldn't bring outside food (aside from the cake and water bottles), and had to order through them. BUT they only offered a couple kinds of pizza, and it turns out, they just go buy it from Marco's in Lindon. Good pizza, but why couldn't I buy it from Marco's or anywhere else myself and bring it in? Then I would've been able to have more choices than just pepperoni or cheese pizza. Plus, the staff member who went to pick it up got lost so we couldn't start our pizza party in the room until 25 minutes after our scheduled time anyway (poor kids were getting hungry). I asked if we could bring in a veggie or fruit tray (minimal mess and something healthy) and they absolutely refused saying it was against policy, but they don't offer anything healthy, just the pizza and juice boxes. I assumed they would have enough plates for us since we ordered 8 pizzas, but they only provided 10 plates for the kids (I guess adults don't get plates). I didn't know so I didn't bring our own and then they charge 50 cents a paper plate if you want any extras. It's truly wild! So yeah, the play place is safe and fun for the kids to play, but their party policies are nuts and don't make any sense, so I can't fully recommend it, for a birthday party, at least.
And FYI, the party rooms are pretty small so the kids fit fine but the adults were crowded around the edges just standing with only a few able to sit.

Review: Visited for our first time today and my kids absolutely loved it, it’s clean and my kids could have spent all day here, however, the only thing that was disappointing was it isn’t allergy friendly. We noticed maybe a hour in that multiple kids were eating uncrustables, then running back out into the play area, and as someone myself & with kids with severe peanut allergies it put me into panic mode instead of being able to relax and have fun, and we had to leave. They also have all over the website and doors no outside food or drinks and almost every parent in there had outside food and drinks, which just caused more worry with my kids and their allergies. Like I said it’s cute and fun and I wish we could have stayed but our trip was cut severely short because my kids safety was put at risk, it should at least be listed that kids need to wash hands before reentering play area or a suggestion to have a peanut eating zone to help navigate and include more children to play because allergies are so huge nowadays.

I thought you could get pizza there from the website, but that’s only true if you schedule a party in advance and then they have it delivered. They don’t make pizza on-site. Which is fine. We just ordered dominoes afterwards :).

Review: It was our first time here and we were so excited to try it out. This is not a place for small children. They have an area for three years and under, but the rules aren’t enforced. There were big kids in that small area for part for the time we were there. When we were playing in the back with the trampolines, most kids were unsupervised. My one year old had a 10 year hit her in the face a couple times with balls. Even though we were with our baby. Most of the parents were in the front socializing letting their kids run around doing whatever they want. The floors foam tiles were dirty and not cleaned. Some tiles were even overlapping and not connected causing a tripping hazards. I really wanted to like this place. :/

We would have come back and paid for an additional 2 children but because the policy is that you have to pay for the child that's been there already that day a second time, we didn't return at all.

Review: We had a birthday party for our daughter this past weekend. It was a good experience for the most part! The kids had fun, I love that the room was set up for the party with plates and juice boxes for the kids.

However, we had issues with being able to order food for the party. We had reserved the date months ago, and on the website it said we would be able to order pizza through the facility, which was great because they didn’t allow any other outside food. I called the week of the party to verify the details, and they told me they wouldn’t be able to get pizza because the pizza place wouldn’t be open until the afternoon. This was frustrating because I was counting on having lunch for our guests, and if it was noted on the website or if I was made aware of this prior to the party I probably would have gone somewhere else.

Also when we got to the playground we saw that another party had brought in pizza, even though it was made clear to us that outside food wasn’t allowed, aside from cupcakes.

Anyway, other than that we had a decent experience. I don’t know if I would do a birthday party again, but I might go back with my kids just for the day.

Review: I love bringing my kids here, especially during the winter. There is just so much for them to do and they’re able to get all that energy out… although the last time I came, I asked cashier lady upfront why my total was so much… I always thought it was if you pay for an older kid if the other child is two or younger they’re free… Not only did she say that’s not the rule anymore she charged me as both of my children were older so instead of coming here thinking I don’t be paying $10 It was that Double that… And if anything, it should’ve been the $5.50 I thought, and then the $9.95… But the lady already seem to be not the best mood, so I just let it go. But it takes our family 25 minutes just to get here and after this, I honestly don’t know if it’s worth the drive anymore…. But besides that the facilities are great, and I really do love coming here.

Review: Cute place for kids. Lots of fun things to do. Favorites were the long slides and the balls that blow into the air. Like that they don’t charge the parent, and only charge the child.

Things I would like the company to consider include:

Most importantly- a way to ensure that those who enter with a child exit only with that child. Safety was a concern while there because there is no checking on who leaves with who. This I see as a big deal as a parent.

Ways to make the play area a bit more visible. The dark netting makes it challenging sometimes to see your child.

Having a separate area for different age groups. Having ages 3-12 all in one space leads to very very big kids in with little littles, often in spaces parents are not.

Review: Edit: response to owner. There's no record of my email because I didn't play. I watched my niece and nephew play. This was not written by a former employee. If that's how you run a business, accusing reviewers of things, consider business lost.

I've been quite a few times, and last year the place was always managed really well. They used to have reminders to parents and children about climbing the slides, throwing things and just a general ""play nice"". We recently went back and there were too many kids being super rude, climbing the slides, pushing, throwing cars up the big slides. Parents weren't doing anything and the staff was just sitting behind the desk not doing anything too. Very frustrating, I miss when the staff would remind parents and children either over the speakers or in person about the rules. The playground itself is clean and sturdy but the staff not doing anything was really disappointing and troubling! There was a staff member there a year ago who was fun and did little reminders a year ago that was always really soft to our kids, can't remember her name but she always had fun hair colors too, we miss her. Think she quit or was fired which is disappointing. Like why fire someone who actually kept your rules up and reminded everyone about them? Or maybe she quit because it was always so hectic. I'm not sure, either way I miss the old coconut cove.

Review: This place has a good thought process behind its purpose as an alternative play and learning place for children.  As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.

Review: I used to live in Reno, and Wonder & Unwind was one of my absolute favorite places to go with my daughter when she was 3. She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.

The space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.

Even after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!

But again, great concept and very clean space. We enjoyed our time here. :)

Review: Overall, the staff is kind and professional, which I appreciate.
Unfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.
I won’t be returning to this place.

There are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.

They offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.

I’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.

I truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!

Review: Wonder and Unwind is such a delightful place to take your littles!  It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.

I wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.

Lastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.

Review: We love Wonder and unwind! It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!

Review: Really nice alternative indoor playspace for young children. There is no climbing structure but it is designed like a little town . Children can go grocery shopping,  change a tire in a car garage,  make a pizza in a pizzaria, deliver mail, go to a salon and a few more places. They give them a couple hours to play with seemed like the right amount of time. My daughter had her 4th birthday party there and it was the perfect age for the imaginative play. It was strange that they charge for the second adult and don't provide anything to adults , so the price adds up quick if both parents want to go either to a birthday party or just regular visits. Other than that rule the place is great and a very nice place to go with the vegas inclimate weather.

I love how they decorate for the seasons! During the summer they did 4th of July decorations with an adorable little “parade” and “fireworks” show. Now that it’s Halloween they did a puppet show that was trick or treat themed. Very chill atmosphere, not super large or overcrowded. It’s a nice place to sit and catch up with friends while the kids play too. Highly recommend ❤️

Review: We are frequent fliers at Toodley Town! My kids love it here. We’ve had play dates here with other friends and I’ve also gone with just my 2 kiddos. I’ve often seen working parents seated at the tables while their kids are playing (such a smart idea). The staff is always helpful and kind. The restrooms are clean, there are refreshments available at the front for purchase, and you can book them for birthday parties.

My only wish is that they’d rotate toys between play sessions. Maybe if they had duplicates of everything they could use UV sanitizers or cleaning wipes and someone could clean everything in the back during one session and then rotate them for the next. I know that’s a big ask/expense so it might not be realistic.

Review: If you have a young child ages walking to eight ,  I highly recommend bringing them to Kids Town to play independently with the other children.

It's the perfect environment for their imagination to grow while exploring their own little town. Imagined by the owners' dream for children to have their own playtown, then hand crafted by her husband.  It's the most unique play experience in the area!

Reasonably priced for every two-hour experience, so that with a limited number of children participating at one time, they all benefit from being able to enjoy all the activities within the town. There's everything with working features; from a house, a school, a beauty shop, a pizza parlor, bakery, hamburger shop, car garage. Post Offiice, Toy shop with creative play, a Veterinarians shop to a market with adorable baskets to fill up their grocery cart with actual store items. Every detail is fashioned after real life with the child in mind.

They allow outside food and drink, although one can buy snacks and beverages there, one must sit at the tables proovided across the dividing street from the town to enjoy and watch your child at play.

The restrooms were clean and well stocked. I liked that the water fountain even included free refills for water bottles.

Pictures say a lot, so enjoy the ones I took, and I hope to see you there!!

We visited again for Christmas this year, on December 19th, and our grandson loved it even more I think, at age 4!

The entire staff is kind, couteous, and engaging! I apprecate their generous offerings for the children.

Each has its own theme and items inside. There are snacks to purchase, the bathrooms are clean, and the workers are always walking around to help make sure kids are staying safe and helping to clean up. There is also PLENTY of seating for adults to sit as their littles explore.

My husband and I were even playing with our girls. You would have to set a reservation to go in, which is great. Helps with crown control. It's definitely a twice a month thing we can do while the older kids are at school.

Review: I had my daughter's 7th birthday at Kids Town and it was amazing!!  We bought the venue out and had 29 children and about 24 adults.

The venue is perfect for the littles!!  While we didn't have any children over 7. I feel like kids might outgrow this stage of play around 8 or 9 tops, I may be wrong!  Some parents who have never been here commented that they would bring their child back, that it was a really cute venue!  It is large enough for the children to spread out so it's not too crowded in any one mini-busines and plenty of tables, chairs and benches for the parents to sit.  The employees came around every-so-often to tidy the toys/accessories, putting the animal stuffies back at the vet, postcards back at the post office and groceries back at the store.

Working with Becky was a pleasure and she made the planning process a breeze!  I contacted her 3 months prior to the party date and secured my date with a deposit.  She was patient and kind, answering all of my planning questions, making suggestions and recommendations.  It was really nice to know that there are add-ons to make the party planning easier on you:  scavenger hunt to find a key that will 'unlock' the goodie bags and cotton candy tokens from the 3D cotton candy machine.  One month prior to the party the color scheme was verified- as they provide matching balloons, tablecloths, plates, napkins, forks, juice boxes and small 8 oz. water bottles for the amount of children you have in attendance.  They also partner with a pizza restaurant and you choose your menu items and they order it for you.  Becky was wonderful in estimating the amount of pizza/food we needed and making suggestions when asked.  This entire process was seamless and EASY!

The party room is the perfect size! The existing wall decor/backdrop decorations provided were perfect (sheer backdrop with string lights, candy cart display table and vine greenery panels) and could be dressed up to suit any theme.  We did bring additional decorations like a balloon garland, some flag banners and a party banner to complete the look and everyone commented on how well decorated it was.

Multiple parents commented on how yummy the pizza was and where I got the cupcakes from.  2 orders of chicken fingers were a hit, the BBQ Chicken Pizza was the first to disappear and it was a really cute touch, that someone from the pizza place drew in the pizza box to wish my kiddo a happy birthday.

Everyone texted and said they had a great time at the party.  So I think that sums up our 2 hours at Kids town- it was worth every penny, I had a great experience from start to finish and I highly recommend hosting your party here!

Review: Fun spot for younger kids to play and use their imagination. They have a car garage, sweets shop, vet clinic, beauty shop, pizza shop and a few more spaces for kids to play. There are tables set up for parents to sit at and still be able to see your kids. They also offer snack packs up front for purchase.

Review: This place is truly a kids dream. They have every kind of pretend play you could imagine. I actively saw someone cleaning things while we were there as well. My only complaint is that I have a smaller one 3 year's old and even though the place is aimed for his age group it was very difficult for him to play because there was so many larger kids playing and their parents were not watching them. They were bumping into my son, taking his stuff and generally being unruly. I think it would be better if you had a time or day for toddlers instead or an age limit. Having little toddlers mixed with 6+ year olds is too much when the parents don't watch their kids.

Review: This place is super cute and something different than the usual indoor play place. You're gonna see the parents who think it's okay to just sit on the sidelines and let their children wreak havoc. The attendees did alright but could have enforced the rules better. Loses a star for not having any changing tables. Overall, my 3 yr old had a great time and we will be back.

Review: Loved this place and found it to be a great place to take my little one. She loved exploring, the bakery being her favorite. My only reason for giving it a 4 was that we had a run-in with what I am assuming to be the owners daughter that was not pleasant at all. First, my little one (1 year old) was exploring the bakery, and the owners' daughter came in and told us that we needed to leave. She wanted to clean the place, and we needed to get out now! Another little girl had come in and was pretending to be baking, but then the owners daughter started to block her by stepping in front of her every time she tried to walk or move or grab anything. Later in the hour my little one was standing on the picnic blanket and the same little girl was riding on a balance bike and went off the ""road"" headed straight towards my little one stopped with the front tire hitting her legs and then just stayed there squeaking the little horn on the bike at my daughter. Kids will be kids. i totally get that, and it really doesn't change my opinion about this place, nor will it keep us from returning.

Review: Such a cute place for kids of all ages to play! My 2.5 year old twins and 1 year old boy had a blast the full 2 hour play session. The soda shop is such a nice touch and we also enjoyed the $4 snack bag.

The best part is how amazing all the employees were. They are all so nice and they kept everything cleaned and put together. A place like this has potential to be a disaster and no fun if everything was misplaced, but they were going around cleaning up after all the kids so everyone could continue to have fun.

Review: I had higher expectations... customer service was great, but they are way over priced for what they're offering. They're comparable to a small area of the children's discovery museum, but charging more? For less?? 🤔 We arrived in a middle of a session that had 30 minutes left, we were advised we could pay double price to join the current session (for me would've been $32 for my 2 children for 30 minutes of play), or we were advised we could come back in 45 minutes when the new session started. I understand not wanting to over crowd, but there were literally 5 kids and 1 was in a stroller. Kids Town, you should AT LEAST offer a pro rate price for joining a session already in progress ESPECIALLY when there isn't anyone there. I was disappointmented because I was really interested in trying this place out, but after seeing in person, we were very underwhelmed. We ended up going to LOL Kids 6 minutes down the street, paid $20 (with Groupon) and stayed for 3 hours. After this experience we're no longer interested in trying out this place.

Review: We’ve had my Grandkids birthday here the last 2 years and it’s very pricey. This Saturday we got there early to set up and with 15 minutes left until guests would be arriving my Granddaughter started playing. The employee told her and my son in law that she can not play unless they paid for her to do so. IMO, if you’re spending $1000 for a 2 hour party, letting the birthday girl play for 15 minutes should be allowed. It also was not because they were at capacity being she would be able to play if we paid full price for the 15 minutes. Very disappointing for a kids establishment to act this way. We won’t be going back!!

Review: The only issue I had with Kids town is I brought my 1 year old son there to play. I also had my 9 year old Daughter there too. She was not playing and only following me so she could also watch out for my son due to there being much larger kids there. The manager told me that my daughter could not be in the play area unless she was paid for. I advised them that she was only following me and not playing with any of the toys. They said she had to stay in the parent area and sit. Then they changed their mind and said I could pay for an additional adult which was $5 so she could be in the play area. I completely do not agree with this due to her being a 9 year old only following me and helping me with my 1 year old son. I do not plan on going back,.

Their is AC inside the building and lot of kids for your child to play with.  The staff there is nice and every so often tell all parents to make sure their kids are not running for the safety of all kids there.

Review: This place is super fun for toddlers but they have this weird rule where you have to go between certain times. We got there at 1105. They said the next session starts at 1130 if we want to stay for a full 2 hours. We told them we only want to stay for 1 hour. They said then you have to pay for both sessions 😒 why would it cost more to stay less ,?! Makes no sense. Anyways we stayed for 25 minutes and paid 20$. Little guy was devastated to leave but we had to because of their weird rules.

Toddlers have strict schedules, they can lose customers based on the 2 hour session rule. It should be more flexible or even have the option to stay less but not stick to the weird schedule. Seems like a bad business model tbh as there are only 4 sessions in 1 day. I have a toddler where am I suppose to go for 25 minutes to wait for the next session? We don't live here so we can't just go home. Anyways, it's a fun place but I wish they were more flexible with play times

You can just sit back and listen to the soothing music and not have to worry that your kid is going to find a way to kill themselves every 4 minutes. Or watch your kid be cute doing stuff with a miniature town. Either way, it's just a great place for kids and parents alike.

Review: Little dreams is such a great play area for small kids! So many options from imaginary play, things to climb, puzzles, slides, and more! My kids had the best time and did not want to leave! Love supporting a small local business. The owner is so nice and welcoming. Will be coming again soon!

Review: Just went for the first time. My 2 year old loved it. The staff is very nice and everything was well taken care of and clean. It’s a nice alternative for when it’s too hot outside to play. I also liked that it’s for kids 6 and under so I didn’t have to worry about my child getting trampled or pushed over.

Review: The playplace was clean and had lots of nice wooden toys and play sets.  Staff was super helpful and was very regularly cleaning up and organizing the toys that little ones dropped on the floor.  Bathroom was also clean and had a nice changing table.  It's hard to find many playplaces in the area for children 2 and under, this place is great!

Review: This little spot is magical. My 3 year old really loved all the toys and he ended up playing with the puzzles the most. The turf that covers the floor under the player equipment is perfect for any falls or trips.

The inside is well cooled and I appreciated that with it being so hot outside. I will be visiting again even though it’s about 35 minutes from my house…. That’s how worth it this place is!

Review: This place is great!! Yes, it’s small and that was my only concern compared to somewhere like Kid Clubhouse. But I think it’s much better for younger kids. It’s small so it’s easy to keep track of young kids and it’s much more age appropriate for younger ones. There were also some older kids there that didn’t seem to have any issue with the space. It’s small but it’s quaint, not cramped.
Plus, you can bring your own food and admission is for the whole day.
We will definitely be back!

The Montessori/Waldorf-style play toys are high quality and thoughtfully chosen. The entire space is insanely clean, which as a parent, I really appreciate. The owner is so welcoming, and the environment is calm and relaxing—not too big, so it’s easy to keep an eye on your kids no matter where they are.

We’ll most definitely be back, and I can’t wait to book a party here!

Parking is very easy, the space is very clean and spacious, and the staff are very friendly!

Review: I have loved bringing my kids! I brought my oldest on a mommy/son date and liked it enough to bring both my kids with their cousins. And I just love that it's safe enough that I don't have to be next to each kid 24/7. I can find each one easily. And with such a wide variety of things to do that we can stay all day and the kids still don't want to leave at night. The staff are super friendly and everyone I have met here is so sweet too. Feels like a little community. They regularly have staff cleaning and vacuuming. I don't like how grimey a lot of these indoor playgrounds get so I appreciate that.
Key points to keep in mind:
-2 adults included in child price
-you have to leave to eat outside food (you can bring water bottles and buy food there)
-You can come back after leaving if it's the same day, just keep your receipt
-the pink slide gets as fast as a roller coaster going down, so be warned.

And I agree whole heartedly haha it’s huge and there are amazing snack choices for everyone (even a few vegan options for me!). The slides are fast, obstacles are huge and easy enough that our almost 4 year old could navigate them, the car things are a blast, there’s a dance party spot, and the staff is super friendly (shout out to Sophia for checking us in and getting our snacks and recognizing us when we came back after cat gazing haha!!!). I definitely foresee many trips here in the future!

Review: This place has a good thought process behind its purpose as an alternative play and learning place for children.  As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.

Review: I used to live in Reno, and Wonder & Unwind was one of my absolute favorite places to go with my daughter when she was 3. She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.

The space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.

Even after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!

Review: This is such a great concept for parents wanting to have their littles near while we can get work done, I can’t wait to see Wonder & Unwind grow and even possibly into a bigger space (or maybe expand on the “parents” section) because if one is working or reading, the kids can still be pretty loud or present. But again, great concept and very clean space. We enjoyed our time here. :)

Review: Overall, the staff is kind and professional, which I appreciate.
Unfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.
I won’t be returning to this place.

Review: I LOVE THIS PLACE!!
There are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.

They offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.

I’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.

I truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!

Review: Wonder and Unwind is such a delightful place to take your littles!  It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.

I wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.

Lastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.

Review: I love this place for little ones! The staff is always warm and friendly, and they have the coolest activities in each room. The other neat thing I have not seen at any other playground type environment is caregiver staff that are nurturing and watching for safety issues. The other bonus is the cafe for great snacks, yummy drinks, and the parent WiFi to get something important done if needed. Thank you Bailey, this is something I wish they had in more places!!!

Review: We love Wonder and unwind! It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!

Highly recommend especially if your kiddo has a winter birthday like mine does. The parents enjoyed it too because of their coffee and tea bar. All around was a great experience!

Review: I took my 2-year old granddaughter to play on a Monday morning. There were older kids running through out the space, even in the smaller spaces designated as quiet areas. These kids took toys from one space to another even though they were told not to. They were very possessive and not willing to share the toys. 5 of these children left with one of the women who was working there.
I was not impressed.

Review: Our entire family absolutely loves going to Kid Clubhouse! We stopped in today at the very end of the day to get our wiggles out. I am appreciative of the multiple age designated play areas. Our toddler had a blast and fit right in with play activities with our big kid. Everyone belongs. ❤️

The staff was absolutely incredible! I don't mean just one-- every single staff member was attentive and generous with their kindness toward our crew. The front desk was great with helping us find the perfect fit with socks. On our way out, they made sure we had stickers to easy the transition of leaving with the boys. They also shared with us about the rewards program and answered all one million of our questions-- even as they were closing up for the day. They modeled kindness and patience with everyone--Truly the sweetest staff ever!

The nursing and changing room is always so welcoming and calm. I deeply appreciate the space for small sensory breaks in addition to changing. Our boys really appreciate it!

Thank you for all you do to make families feel supported and welcome while at Kid Clubhouse!

Review: We visited this past weekend for the first time. This place was awesome! Our kid had a blast, workers were always cleaning or keeping an eye on the kids. Our kid is 2 1/2 and really enjoyed the smaller kids area. It was nice to see the employees actually sticking to the 45” rule and politely asking bigger kids to play on the rest of the equipment. Everyone seemed friendly enough too. Something we didn’t consider but loved to see was the ample amount of seating for parents to chill while their kids ran rampant. A great atmosphere, safe and clean, we will definitely be spending cold/rainy days here in the future!

I came to review Kid Clubhouse and forgot I did it a while back ago. But I feel an update is still worth the edit. Since going to KC ~1 year ago, we have visited a number of times since then. My then 2 1/2 year is now almost 4 and still absolutely loves every aspect of Kid Clubhouse. Everything I said in my original post is still very valid. Kid Clubhouse has been unwavering in their commitment to provide a clean and safe place for kids to go. Out of several visits I haven’t had a single complaint about anything. We recently visited this past weekend, and after a couple of hours of playing it was time to go get dinner and head home for the night. During bath time our 4 year old was talking about “the nice man cleaning the steps but he said we could still climb!” That made us chuckle, a few minutes pass and he grabs the wash cloth and starts cleaning the tub walls. He proceeds to tell us “I’m pretending I’m the man at Kids Clubhouse and I’m cleaning!” (Don’t come at me, I say Kid Clubhouse he insists it’s Kids Clubhouse 😂) so if that doesn’t say anything about their values, I don’t know what does! Our kiddo absolutely loves the environment, he makes new friends every time we go, and evidently he appreciates the cleanliness too. Thanks KC for always being there for us tired parents 😅

Review: I've visited many indoor play lands and this one is the absolute very best!   They offer play areas for crawling infants to elementary age.  One of my gauges is cleanliness and this place is clean.  I've seen workers wipe tables and vacuum during the very busy times.  This place is HUGE on the inside with plenty of seating and tables.  Additionally, one pays only one price to stay the entire day.   You are permitted to leave and return the same day - jackpot!  For added security, the parent / guardian is matched to the child(ren) with matching wrist bands.

I got there early so I could get a good parking spot in the yellow zone, but it makes me feel more deserving of the iced caramel latte. I’ll get at their Mason location next week.

This boy was about 8 or 9 and he was choking, body slamming, kicking ,and punching at the children around him. These children were ages 3-6 years old. Babies! So when I brought it to the attention of the staff they said we will have him apologize!? What? Why don't you remove the bullies?” We don't do that here”. So i will never be back and i will never recommended this place to anyone on the planet. If you love you children, DO NOT TAKE THEM HERE.

Review: First time here was today and I have to say, I was beyond impressed and can’t wait to come back - and we live an hour away! Having a very active 2.5 year old means I’ve been to countless playgrounds (indoor and outdoor) and this was the most relaxed I’ve felt as far as safety goes and a new favorite, hands down.

For starters, the playground itself is adult friendly all the way up to the top. This is crucial for my child’s age.  Some playgrounds you have to just watch from the bottom and hope that they are OK. Or… you think you’re good to join your toddler, and then once you’re up there, there’s a part at the top that is too tight of a squeeze for most adults… then you’re stuck forcing your screaming toddler to come back down since you’re worried about their safety. But even without parents *inside* the playground itself, it was so easy to supervise from down below and I have zero concerns about any areas she could have fallen down or been unsafe in any way. The design is absolutely perfect. Thankfully we came at a not busy time, so she had lots of room to run and play freely for 2.5 hours.

And on top of that - the cleanliness was noticed and appreciated so much. Staff was continuously sanitizing every surface. I was surprised to even see a staff member sanitizing a padded pole in the middle of a sitting area.

The staff is too friendly always cleaning and helpful as can be. This place is too spotless. How is it cleaner than my house I constantly clean up after when it’s just 3 kids and here it’s more than just three kids! I hate it so much because my kids never want to leave and I never want to leave. They make it where I’m allowed to stay and come back even. They have suspiciously good coffee, oddly fast WiFi. My kids have played for HOURS here with minimal crying. They’re demanding me of affordable snacks and I can’t stand how happy everyone is around me. I hate it so much that I keep coming back.

The owners and the staff went above and beyond to ensure everyone was taken care of, to include both service dogs that were there and WELCOMED!! Sadly, some places treat others with disabilities and service dogs terribly causing unnecessary trauma (even worse trauma when children are involved), but not here. Here, they right others' wrongs! These people are amazing and have wonderful hearts. The owners of Kid Clubhouse may not be able to take away what happened to Keaton and Murphy at that terrible skating rink, but these wonderful people opened their hearts and their business to a very deserving family and they did everything they could to ensure he had the most memorable birthday ever!!! Please support this business as they support the community and what this world should be about - love and support. ♥️

Even during busier hours, the kids and parents have been kind and respectful, and I love that the culture there really encourages parents to play with their children (and keep a close eye on them in the process). It's by far the cleanest indoor playground that we've ever been to, and the pricing is so much better than other indoor kid-centered activities in the area.

Also, if you (respectfully) disagree with what they’re saying on social media, they’ll block you. They posted my husbands review of the place, which was an honest review from a paying customer, and shredding it. I replied to some comments making false accusations about him (and again, I was respectful) and I was blocked. Extremely unprofessional. I’m super disappointed as I was excited to try this place out. Will definitely be sharing how this wasn’t a good experience. I wasn’t even going to post a review on google until they blocked me. They obviously did this to hide and save face. Do better.

Review: Our granddaughter had fun playing here, but the place seemed understaffed. However, the facility appeared clean. Many big kids were playing in the toddler zone, and some children were without socks which are required for hygiene and safety reasons. All the staff who were working seemed friendly and professional, but there was only one staff member who was checking people in and out. We will probably return, but I would have given more stars if there was a heavier staff presence.

Review: Been here a few times with my wife and son (who is special needs by the way) and each time it was great. My son absolutely loves this place! Tons for the kiddos to do! Places to sit for parents. Good wifi to get work done while the kids play. It has it all which makes it convenient for people like me. I am a small business owner myself and things get crazy. Sometimes I have to drop what I’m doing and get some work done. Anyways, with that said, this a good spot to go with the family and if you are like me who may have to get some work done at the drop of a dime, this place has the resources available that accommodate that. Very few places around here cater to both the kids and adults in that sense. The only downside is that the place can get filled up quickly, especially on weekends! Other than that, awesome spot!

Review: I would like to formerly apologize to the public for being so childish and previously giving Kid Clubhouse a fake 1 star review. I wanted to be let in an hour and a half before opening hours on Sunday, and during a private party booking, and was told “no”. I was angry because my entitlement got the best of me that morning and I woke up genuinely confused as to why the world didn’t revolve around me. I’ll be summoning my mom group to let them know this place is def worth the extra $1. Plz dont ban me, I’m already banned from the Dayton Mall’s super cool and totally “clean” indoor play area 🤞🏼

I also love the matching bands to ensure kids are not leaving with the wrong adult. I recommend this place to all families. The new toddler area is so much fun too. Great way for the kids to get their energy out.

During my visit today my large, almost full coffee was knocked over and spilled on the floor. I tried to clean it while my friend informed an employee. Within seconds a very friendly young man cane, wiped it up and then moped with a smile and even THANKED us for telling him! No outward frustration about the situation.
During the same visit, a different employee was up in the climbing area wiping down the playground!
Over the past 4 years we have been coming here it is always a clean and friendly experience!

They were incredibly attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to care about making the day special for our kids.

The party space was absolutely amazing—beautifully decorated with so much attention to detail. It truly felt festive and fun, and it was clear that a lot of care went into making it look perfect for the occasion. The kids were thrilled, and so were we!

The venue itself was clean, safe, and full of fun activities to keep the children entertained. The staff was great at engaging with the kids and making sure everyone had a great time. It was also a stress-free experience for the parents, which made the day even better.

We can’t thank Capabilities enough for helping us create such a memorable day. If you're looking for a place to celebrate a birthday or any family event, we highly recommend them!

Review: We have visited Capabilities several times and every experience has been amazing. Today however, knocked it out of the park for us. We booked a party for our 4 year old- I believe it was the Super Duper Deluxe package. We arrived and the room was decorated in Frozen theme we requested, sadly I didn’t get any pictures because we went straight to having fun. The person working (didn’t catch her name) was so kind and let us know if we needed anything to ask her before making a trip out. My girls are 2.5 years apart and they both had so much fun. All of our guests were so pleased. Many of them had never visited Capabiltied before and they were all highly impressed. We had 3 hours and didn’t feel rushed with the 2 hour time limit that many places have. I love the inclusive environment and I’ll shout it from the roof tops- this is a place that deserves your business. 100/10, there isn’t a thing I would change.

You can easily keep an eye on your kids without feeling overwhelmed or losing track of them. The facility is clean, and the staff is friendly.

I tried the one month membership to see if it would be a good fit, and I absolutely loved it! It was such a great experience that I decided to get the yearly membership.

Review: I had my daughters 5th birthday here. Not only was this place amazing with awesome toys for everyone including out 11 year old nephew. The ladies who run this place are truly something else. Let me start with I messaged them on the 30th of December looking for a party for January 4th. They were willing to make that happen for me. They gave me a full day to pick a package, a party theme and then gave me the times they were able to host. Sent me the invoice and boom everything was done. I showed up with pizzas and a cake in hand about 10 minutes before the party started. They let us in to sent everything down and apologized for still working. Heck I was the one 10 minutes early and yet they still wanted to make sure I was happy. Before they left our party room they asked me how I liked it, wished the birthday girl happy birthday and helped us out any way that they could. These ladies and the place they own and run are amazing. I highly recommend coming here for indoor play, to have a kids party and to honestly feel like you have walked into a place that will treat you like family. I can 1000% say in all my childhood birthdays and the birthdays I host for my kids no place will ever be or beat them. They are truly the best. Drop that Y membership and get one for capabilities. You will not regret it I promise.

100/10 would recommend them. My kids are excited to go back

Review: This is a fantastic place to host a birthday party. We had the entire place to ourselves for several hours at an affordable cost. There are varying packages for all budgets!

We go to play, and spend hours here. It’s easy to do when it’s affordable…and my favorite is being able to bring food/drinks for my tribe. They come in clutch though with snacks and drinks on site if you don’t bring your own.

They host classes regularly to take part in, and have even invested in therapy groups on site.  Regardless of ability…. Your child will have an absolute blast here!

But wait…. There’s MORE!  They sell annual passes. You won’t regret visiting!!

You can tell they love what they do and love bringing smiles to our little ones and us as well because seeing our kids so happy, makes us all happy. I got so many compliments from the moms about the great venue and how it catered to all ages, needs and interests. There was thought and loved put into all the different play areas for sure! I just can’t say enough about how amazing it was thanks to Lindsay and her amazing staff. Will for sure host another party there and take my little ones more often to play there. Hands down; easiest birthday party I have planned thanks to them who even decorated for me! Yeah, we all had an amazing experience! Thank you

The decorations were more than I could’ve ever asked for, the treat bags were so cute, and the cupcakes were delicious. It was the BEST way to do things and such a weight off of my shoulders. I can’t thank you guys enough!! The facility was so much fun and it really is for all ages!

I pulled up, walked a couple doors down and grabbed pizza, and had the party! Our children loved it and it didn’t t feel “overwhelming” like other play areas. I highly recommend for a low effort, efficient, fun party.

Review: I went with my grandchildren and they had a fun time, indoor play places are a wonderful option for good or rainy days! However; I was concerned about safety. Everything was very cluttered, and chaotic, too much crowded into areas and toys and blocks strewn everywhere. I did appreciate that the support beams in the swing area were covered with pool noodles for safety, but there were other spots that with all the clutter a child could easily fall and knock their head on. My recommendation is add more pool noodles to pad additional areas, and equally important have an additional staff member that can monitor and maintain the toys and equipment, to keep them in their designated areas, the one staff member that was there remained at the desk the entire day to manage incoming customers. Also reduce the amount of toys and blocks.

Review: My husband and I discovered this wonderful establishment about a year ago with our grandson. We drive 45 minutes each way to spend 3 hours with our grandson every Wednesday. Lindsey has created a laid back, friendly, comfortable place for all of her patrons. It is like our home away from home on Wednesdays. We can kick back on the oversized pillows talking and catching up, or sit and play blocks or play tag and hide and seek. My grandson is always excited to see Lindsey and to make new friends. He always has a hug for Lindsey before he leaves as well. We cannot recommend Capabilities Play for All Abilities enough and we are thankful for getting to know Lindsey and Corey!

Review: We had our son’s 3rd birthday party here yesterday and every single detail was perfect. All we had to do was pick the theme and they handled the rest. Lyndsey, who is the owner, was very responsive and pleasant. Taylor, the manager/ face painter, was extremely helpful and nice. She also did amazing with the face paint! The kids loved it. This was my husband’s first time planning a party and with their help he looked like a pro. Everything went very smoothly and this is coming from someone who had never stepped foot in the establishment prior to the party. It’s is also kept very clean. I would highly recommend for a kids party or even just a normal play date!

Review: We went today for the first time and we will 100% be coming back! We arrived around 3:45 and for the first hour we were there, there was only one other kid there which was so nice for my little sensory guy! My son is 3 (has cerebral palsy) and my daughter is almost 6 (typical development) and they both had a blast! There were plenty of things for both of them to do! I really appreciate the padding on almost everything my son tried to get (he’s wobbly) because he could just crawl around freely and I didn’t have to worry he would bonk his head. My son’s favorite things were the bubble wall and hanging spaghetti type lights and my daughter’s favorites were the crash pads and play hamsters (haha)! We would love another location closer to us (in beavercreek). We don’t have anything like this and I think it would be a great success but until then, we are happy to make the drive for the inclusiveness of this place!

Review: This place has so much potential.. everytime I have went, I have seen the owners be incredibly judgmental of the children playing, and their parents. I understand these businesses are difficult. But to consistently stare down parents, and their kids, and be hostile when you feel the kids aren’t playing “correctly” is sad. I get the impression this is a business ran by two people who don’t love kids. I don’t enjoy coming here, but had high hopes that ultimately were let down. My son pushed the shopping cart out of the grocery area, and into the ball pit, the owner came rushing over, took the shopping cart from my son, and made a huge deal. I’ve seen it done to other kids as well. This is not a welcoming place. It is not a safe place.

I don’t mind driving over an hour weekly to allow them to play especially when it’s all day play and we can bring in food and drinks. We have met the owner and the assistant manager and they both were so accommodating, very polite to the kids and were consistently making sure the play space was clean and equipment was in tip top shape. I would and will recommend this place to everyone.

She started throwing and kicking objects to the proper ""zone""  and yelling at parents and children,  these objects included the hard Lego blocks where some kids were close by. Yelled at parents for playing with their children. Her behavior was unacceptable! Would never recommend this place!

Being enclosed I don’t worry bout him running into a dangerous area like the parking lot. He loves it so much and price is so reasonable. Everyone can afford to give their child several hrs of fun and smiles

My newest great grandson is less than a year but could enjoy the play area as well

Review: Very cute little place for toddlers wish some of the parents that brought kids there had more respect for the place. It’s annoying to watch parents let their kids destroy things intentionally and barely say a word to them. I feel for the front desk who did ask the kids to stop even though it’s the parents responsibility to keep their kid in check and not just ignore what’s happening.

Review: This is a very toddler-friendly place, so if you have a child under 5, it’s a great option. However, it may not be as engaging for older kids. Since my son is 1, I find it better suited for us compared to other places. Another big advantage is that they have workstations for parents, with desks and chairs, which is fantastic. I can sometimes get work done while keeping an eye on my child playing nearby. The space is also not too large, making it easier to keep track of my kid because I can spot him quickly. Another perk I appreciate is that they allow outside food and drinks, so I can easily feed my son during playtime.

Review: I went to Wigglin' out with my girls the other day. While they did have fun, I dont think we'll be returning. Nothing seemed very clean, lots of damaged or broken toys, and toys not in their correct place (and not being returned to their home by staff in the 2 hours we were there.) The poor girl at the front seemed to be alone, handling everything. I get it, she can only do so much. With that, there were also issues of enforcing rules. There were kids eating in the play area, running, taking off socks, and a child almost leaving the building, which I, personally, had to stop and console him while trying to keep track of my own kids. If the price was half as much as Kangamoo, Wally Wombats, or Kids Town I could see past all these things but for the same price, we'll drive a little farther to go someplace that is more kept up.

Review: Today we visited Wigglin’ Out Indoor Playground LV and the girls had a great time!

If I find a play area that allows them to play while I can sit and decompress, it's always a win. I would say that this play area is great for kids 6 and under based on the size of the toys and space inside of the play area. Bring your own socks, or you can purchase them for only $2/pair. Very clean as well. Friendly staff.

Review: Both my kids (ages 1 & 4) love Wigglin out! We have been coming here for years.

Wigglin Out is a smaller indoor playground, geared towards younger kids, which I love, because some of the bigger playgrounds are overwhelming for toddlers. The facility is locally owned, spotlessly clean, and the owners/staff are so kind.

Wigglin Out is also one of the most reasonably priced indoor playgrounds in Vegas, and they run great specials and host fun events. This is definitely one of our favorite spots for the whole family.

Review: We were in Vegas for a week (end of August) and attended this facility about 4-5 times. We had a fantastic experience. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Most importantly, the facility is more intimate and not as loud/hectic as other indoor playgrounds.

There are plenty of different toys for children to experience. We really valued that the size was more intimate (it made our children less distracted and not as over stimulated as the louder, super bright/neon/flashy places) but most importantly, this Wigglin' Out is OPEN EARLIER than all the other places.

The earlier open hours were key because most children are up early so to have to wait until 11 am to start burning off energy is too close to lunch/nap times. Now keep in mind, we were visiting from Canada so I recognize that earlier weekday hours may not be as important for locals.

But for us, as tourists, this venue was excellent: wonderful customer service, more calm/intimate setting, and better opening hours.

Review: My experience with Wigglin' Out has been a fantastic experience. Chris, the owner, is great with all of the families that enter into the facility. We are all like family in his eyes. He keeps the center clean and organized. The children have a wonderful time and enjoy playing with each other. It is a perfect place to take my toddler as well as take a break and watch her play. I am a first time parent. Finding places that are made just for her is a little bit hard. This place has ample space for the children to explore yet small enough for me to keep my eyes on my little one, while sitting down. I continue to come became my little one loves it so much. It's were she gets her wiggles out. Thank you Chris for always being wonderful to my family. We truly appreciate it!

Review: This place is great. I’ve been bringing my daughter since she was 11 months old. They have a young toddler section that is somewhat blocked off and you can safely trap your baby in there. Now that my daughter is 20 months she has so much fun running around, jumping, sliding and playing in the ball pit.
This place is a lot cleaner than other indoor playgrounds and I like that it’s not too big so I can keep my eye on her but also give her some space to play.
They have comfy couches for parents and an eating area so the kids can enjoy their snacks. The other great thing is you don’t pay by the hour so you can really let your kids burn off all their energy.

Clean play area and clean snack/sitting area for the parents. We’ve been back twice now and I plan on purchasing the 10 passes for $85 or the monthly plan. It wasn’t posted anywhere that you had to pay 3 months upfront for the monthly plan (which was $60 or $65 per month, I believe) so heads up on that.

Review: So my 14 month old bit someone’s child and I apologized, I was supervising my child through all the time he was playing and apologized to parents if my baby was being hyper active or doing smth wrong. He was very excited to see other children. So this mom complained to the front desk about my child instead of making a connection with me and maybe get our children play together. Like cmon my child is still a baby and I’m doing my best to teach him the right way and it’s not like every parent is perfect, we all make mistakes when educating our children. The front desk person was telling me to supervise my child better and tell him the right way to behave. I’m trying to do my mom job and I have a very active baby and I get tired too. I was told in a rude manner as though saying we are not welcomed back. Especially the other mom was a regular customer. I could become a regular Cust too. I need my money back please

Review: We had our daughter’s 2nd birthday here this afternoon and everyone loved it! The kids at our party ranged from 1yo-10yo and they had plenty of entertainment in the play gym. Our teenagers and adults played games in the party room. There was truly enough to keep everyone entertained without coming off as overwhelming or overstimulating. Even some of our adults joined in the ball pit fun! Both rooms are kept tidy and clean and the staff is beyond phenomenal! They helped us with anything and everything needed to make our party a success. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making our princess’ birthday extra special! We cannot wait to come back and play.

Review: Oceans playhouse is such a neighborhood treasure! It’s pristine, beautifully themed, and such a wonderful place for creative, imaginative, active play.
Our kids loved it! They spent hours playing and making friends, practicing teamwork, and really having a blast. It has great obstacle courses and aims to please all age categories. Even the teeniest 💕🥰.
The staff is so sweet and even interacted and played with the kids. Clearly they love what they do and it showed from the service to the details of this play area.

Highly recommend.

Review: This place is wonderful, neat and clean! I gave it 3 stars because my toddler refused to go into the balls so she sat near me and I did not pay for her but later my son threw balls to her and she threw it back inside so they asked me to pay for her play time. I feel it is too pricey. I was there an hour with 2 kids, one who barely touched a few balls and it was $40. Otherwise this place is wonderful! The staff is super nice and they gave prizes to my kids when I left.

Review: Just had my son’s 1st birthday party here and everyone (even all the adults) had a blast. The room next door where they set up the tables and food was very spacious for everyone, and was set up very nicely. They offered board games to the teens to play if they wanted to do their own thing. It was an amazing setting if you’re not looking for anything overwhelming and where you are able to keep an eye on your children while they wear themselves out for a great nap! lol! The staff is super nice and accommodating! I am very happy I chose this place to have his party at!

Review: I was searching all over google for a nice indoor play area within a 25 mile range from home. I decided on this place because of the soothing colors and good reviews.
My one year old had the best time of her life. This place is adorable with its ocean theme. The blue and white balls, and many stuffed ocean animals. It's way nicer than the other indoor play areas that are overwhelmingly brightly colored.
Great for very little ones. (and for bigger little ones!)
Reasonably priced and nice staff.

Review: A very nice small playhouse for little kids, they have a big ball pit where to play, swings in the back and a nice climbing area with three stories high, the kids had a good climbing experience. Three slides together to get down and a closed slides for a little more thrill. Very friendly staff. Socks is required so if you anyway plan to where them make sure you have otherwise you will have to pay $4 per pair.

From the time we walked in till the time we left the owner of the place was very hospitable and kind telling us about why she started oceans playhouse. She expressed her love for kids and that this was part of her life in China these types of playhouses. The place is very clean, they have a safe place for babies to play, and is very reasonable in price! Although it was for the kids us adults was in there having fun too throwing balls and playing tag! I definitely recommend this place for anyone who has children around the ages of 2 to 8 it is very fun and great exercise at the same time for your youngins.

Review: This is a nice - smaller environment indoor playground with two great slides, a good two level play cage with fun tunnels and climbing nets. It also boasts a large pool like soft ball pit that the cage and slides are placed. They also have sit on bounce balls around the perimeter and other toys. There is also a small pool covered in clear thick plastic like a water bed for the 2 and under crowed. It has seaweed like plastic toys and other items to give an ocean like experience.. There are a couple of activities that require assistance from adults for some 3yr olds.

The owners also have a banquet like space for parties next door to the playground which is very convenient.

In my two visits it was not busy. My daughter had fun and was not overwhelmed. We even randomly met one of our friends there.

My only complaint is that we were charged twice for our visit but this was quickly rectified.

I must add that the double charge issue was one of misunderstanding. It was an batch posting of credit charges. Two separate visits were received and posted to my account on the same day. It appeared as a double billing when in fact it was two separate visits. The owner was very prompt and courteous in researching what had happened!

Review: I came with a group of 6 kids (from 2-4 yo) and 7 adults during Independence Day weekend and we had the place to ourselves. The kids had crazy amounts of fun and the adults were enjoying not being bothered as the staff helped whenever she saw a child struggling anywhere. Some of the kids started out scared, but she helped us encourage them and told us how to guide them. It was the first time for all the kids to experience such a huge ball pit and tall slides. The rope bridge to the trampoline was ultra cool. They used the space under the structure really well. We took turns going to the nearby Dice Bowl for some tasty drinks and the kids never noticed. A sign of a great play place.

We didn't buy any snacks, but it's a decent selection with slightly higher prices, nothing crazy. I really appreciated the bathroom setup with a changing table and wipes in both single bathrooms as my 2 year old decided that was the best time to go #2. The bathroom was very clean, as was all of the facility. The shoes off policy is a great idea.

We're definitely coming back as the kids really enjoyed their time here. We were there for a party, and as far as I can tell, the price was reasonable and certainly well worth it. The normal entry prices seem standard for this type of place. A good time was had by all (including the adults, I also enjoyed swimming in the ball pit).

We were never issued a refund even though the party was cancelled according to their refund policies.

The woman working there was also very gracious and often quietly came alongside to assist kiddos if she saw they were having a hard time climbing or just to ply with them. There is an age restriction of 8 years old to climb up to the second and third levels, so parents can’t accompany past a certain point.This might be helpful for parents to know ahead of time.

Review: This place is discriminating.

I took my 3 year old son there. The woman didn’t let us in. She only allowed him to play in the ball pit, which is nothing fun at all. She said someone older needs to take him in. My cousin is 11 years old and the woman said she is too big. I begged that my cousin won’t play, will only go supervise my son as they requested. But we still got rejection. I understand if my son needs to be watched. But by what age person? How come 11 is too old to go in supervise? Not to mention on their Facebook, admission fee is one kid plus one guardian. What does guardian mean ?

She didn’t let us in only because she is a discriminating person. My son was crying and they don’t have any sympathy. Please don’t come here, don’t support business like this!!

The play space is clean and seems solidly built. A selection of snacks and bottled water are good for a light snack.

I haven't seen a party here but it seems a great size for private events up to 20 or so kids.

Review: I do not recommend this place. The first strike was that they charge for parents to sit and watch the kids. Fine, it's poor customer relations but it's their business to run. Strike two is if you want to go in to watch you must buy their socks even just to sit and watch. When I protested I was told that was their policy and I didn't have to stay if I didn't like it. I didn't and didn't. That was strike three. This is not a business I want to support and I ask that you don't either.

Review: I have been here multiple times, and I almost booked a birthday party here one year.. but we were in the area so I had decided to play here last Sunday. But we couldn’t even get inside. And after I found out what happened, I will NEVER return.
The parking lot had at least 30 cops, and I asked one grandma, as She was being shuffled out of the building, what happened? This is as the police were taping off the parking lot area, and eventually, the front door after hurrying several other people out of there. She told me, “go, get out of here! There was gunfire! Go!” I will absolutely not return after that, for obvious reasons.

But despite that incident… I would still give this place 1 star because they never keep anything clean. We used to come here a lot, but we had stopped and went to different indoor playgrounds because nearly every time that we would come here, within the next 2-3 days, my kid was sick. And he would end up with an ear infection as a result, and it was really bad. It was at least three separate times that we came to LOL and my son was sick a couple days after.
My son was only 2 then, and I was at home with him all the time.. he couldn’t have got sick from anywhere but here as he was not in daycare, and we really didn’t leave the house very much at all, therefore I know that it had to have been at LOL that he got sick. Kids will be running around coughing and sneezing and still playing and touching everything. If your kid is sick you should not bring them out to a place like this, obviously, but soo many people do it anyways! So rude.

The staff could have done temperate checks during cold/flu season? Or if they saw an obviously sick child, ask the family to leave and sanitize the area? But you don’t see the staff ever cleaning anything here. The tables are a mess a lot of the time, the play area is worse. They only walk around with a leaf blower to “clean” up the ballpit balls that have gone astray. Never seen anyone wipe anything down.
You can tell they don’t really care to clean much of the many surfaces because obvious shoe marks, dirt, etc. all over the play area and floor. The ball pit balls feel disgusting and greasy. It’s the worst on the high levels of the play area. I’ve climbed to the very top which is very high up and that’s where it looks the dirtiest, probably because it’s not as accessible as the ground floor and most parents aren’t up there to notice. But why are there dirty shoe marks when it is a “socks only” facility anyways?!

It is too bad the staff/owner don’t really care, because this place would be great if I was just judging the playground equipment! Unfortunately, they allow in what I feel like is more than their capacity should be, and the place is flooded with kids running left and right, no staff supervision anywhere at all, and they don’t clean a thing afterwards.
The owners obviously don’t care to change their policies and improve this place as I’ve seen numerous other reviews that were recently posted.
Overall they lack sanitation for a children’s facility and we saw the aftermath of an extremely dangerous hazard in a children’s play place… so thankful we weren’t inside when this occurred and I hope everyone was okay.
I hope they get shut down after this incident, it is so not ok for this to have been happening at a place for kids. If they stay open I think they should install metal detectors & hire a decent cleaning crew to sanitize this place.
Will never return ever. I already avoided coming here when my kid would ask, instead I’d suggest a different indoor playground, but now it will be a hard no.
I wouldn’t have even came here today in the first place, but we happened to be nearby on that side of town, so I said fine we will go.
But driving there, I kept telling my son, don’t put your hands in your mouth or on your face, unless you want to get sick!

Review: Great place for the kids, good choice of food and snacks. I really wish they run the AC a bit cooler in this place though, those kids be coming out looking like they came from the pool... I get they are running around but the amount of bodies the room gets warm fast. Especially its summer now with 100+ degrees outside inside should be cool. As a parent just sitting in the dining area its warm..

This place is one of the better bigger indoor play area in the southwest.

Review: This place is a huge safety hazard for kids. There are plastic balls everywhere, many of them cracked and no staff in the playing area at all to monitor. Extremely dirty due to zero maintenance. On top of that the girl at check in was so unprofessional - charged me extra and when I mentioned it after I looked at the rates, she just rolled her eyes and said I should have told her before making payment and that she can’t do anything now. Was unbelievable and so apalling! When I asked if there is someone else I can talk to, she just said there isn’t any supervisor/manager. No apology and zero people’s skills.  She either hated her job or was just a bad person.
I had my kids with me so I went in even though I didn’t want to. I called their customer service line the same night and I was assured the manager will call me in the morning but no one called and it’s been almost a month now.
Hence I am writing this review as it is clear that the problem is not just employees but the business itself. I definitely am not returning and want to warn others as well.

Review: My children enjoyed themselves when they werent slipping on balls that were literally ALL over the place or getting balls thrown in their face by other peoples children who were not being supervised. This place has no safety percautions in place AT ALL. There are children of all ages big and small running at full speed around this small area with no regards to their surroundings even on the concrete where the seating area is located which is a major safety concern since everyone is in socks, I guess thats why you have to sign a waiver prior to entering this danger zone. There is no staff supervision, rule enforcement, limtiation on the number of people inside, no staff picking up the balls that are sacttered in the sitting area which is again all concrete. The food is over priced and definitely not worth it, nothing comes out as it is on the pictures. I ordered Juju nacho supreme wish i would have taken a pic for comparison before throwing them away. In the picture on the menu it shows beef on the nachos, it was given to me with chopped up chicken strips and  none of the toppings on the picture. There is no description of whats on anything just a name and a picture. Great concept for a play place but definitely needs some work!

Review: Came here last Sunday 2/16/25 with my 2 grandchildren. I mean the kids had fun that’s the main thing.

My complaint was that the snack bar prices are way too high.  I ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches which had to be ordered as part of a combo meal. No alacart option.  And it came up to around $42.33.  This cost more than the admission for my two grandkids.  They didn’t have an option to pay in any other form except Zelle…I thought that was peculiar since the snack bar accepted debit/credit…

Bottom- line is that I don’t think we’ll be patronizing this establishment again.

Staff-
Front desk staff were apologetic about having to send a Zelle payment for admission.  For the most part type two gals were friendly and courteous.

Cafe staff.
5/10 for service and value

Was invited to a birthday party and the floor in the room was very slippery. Many slips happened, including me. Yes you sign a waiver to enter. Now I see why. Fun place for kids, but this is just one big injury/lawsuit waiting to happen. Now imagine having to go into the public bathroom, in your socks. I did not want to try that.

Review: I was extremely disappointed with our experience at LOL Kids Club in Las Vegas. It’s supposed to be a fun and inclusive place for children, but unfortunately, we experienced clear discrimination during our visit. The staff treated us unfairly compared to other guests, and when we brought up our concerns, they were dismissive and unhelpful. No family should have to deal with this kind of treatment, especially in a place meant for kids to feel safe and welcome. I will not be returning, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately.

The Arabic man who says he is the manager is horrible. Looked my two 6 year olds and 1 year old in the face and told them he wasn’t letting them in and they were not going to play today.  Do not bring your children. Children do not deserve this verbal abuse.

Review: If this place can get a 0 rating, it would have been given quickly! This was my first and it will certainly be my last. They expects you to take your shoes off as soon as you get in but their restroom is filthy! I ordered food and found hair in my food. When I addressed it to the lady in the kitchen she didn’t apologize or offer anything else. She just stated “okay” and walked away… Save your money, time, and energy for a place where it not only be cleaned/sanitized but who can be kind! Kindness goes a long way!!

Originally, I rated a 1 star ⭐️ However, I brought it up to a 3. I believe it was the manager that came back and refunded me for my onion rings that had hair in it. I appreciate the effort to try and make things right. That’s an honorable thing he did and I thank him for coming to speak with me and asked if there was anything else he can do for me.

While I felt like the situation was handled inappropriately. I would like to send my sincere apology to the young woman who walked away. I’m learning that people have different responding mechanisms. But want to extend my thank you for bringing it up to management attention to help make things right.

But please, clean your restrooms and floors. Help keep our community healthy.

Review: My daughter recently hosted my twin granddaughter's birthday party at LOL Kids, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place. My daughter paid $1600 for their Ultimate Package, which included 3 rooms, food (8 large pizzas, 2 appetizer platters, 2 salad platters), unlimited drinks, and icee treats for the kids. While the price was hefty, we expected great service and a smooth experience for such a special occasion – but that wasn’t the case.

Issues we faced:
1.	Shoes Policy Problems: Upon arrival, we were told all adults had to remove their shoes. This included elders and people with health issues who would be sitting the entire time. We had to argue with staff to get waivers to allow our elderly family members to keep their shoes on, which should have been handled more gracefully.

2.	Room Mix-Up: To our surprise, when we got to our reserved rooms, they were given away to another party. We spent nearly 45 minutes sorting this out, and the issue wasn’t resolved until we spoke with the owner. The excuse they gave was that they thought we were part of another party, but no one bothered to confirm anything. It was very frustrating, and we didn’t even get into our rooms until an hour after the scheduled party time. As compensation for the inconvenience, the owner gave us a frozen tiramisu cake and two fruit trays – hardly an adequate fix.

3.	Poor Food and Service: The service at the party was subpar. The host was unprofessional, and we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks and inquire about the food. We were given random food substitutions, like ranch dressing instead of the Caesar dressing we ordered. When we asked the staff about it, they acted like they didn’t know what we were talking about, and one of the workers at the register admitted they had just run out of the correct dressing. Additionally, we had to keep asking for plates, cups, and basic items, which seemed to annoy the host.

For the amount of money we paid, we expected much better service and attention to detail. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing a positive experience.
Final Thoughts: If you’re planning to book a party for your children here, be prepared for potential stress and poor service. The lack of professionalism, mix-ups with reservations, and inattentiveness from the staff made this a frustrating and disappointing experience. For the price, there are certainly better venues that will respect your time, money, and your child’s special day.

Review: Just spent the past two hours here and had a great time. Both kids and grown ups could play. Food was pretty good. Definitely worth the price. UNFORTUNATELY, at the bottom of the big red slide in the ball pit I found my 2 year old daughter playing with this knife. Thankfully it was closed, but I can't even imagine if it was open and my kid or another slid down onto it. Ended up getting sidetracked with my kid running away and forgot to mention it to a worker, I wish I did. Anyway, I feel that they should have someone regularly checking the ball pits and play areas for things like this. It makes sense that ANYTHING can fall out of ANYONES pockets here, it should be regularly checked. Place was fun, a bit run down, but finding the knife definitely was not. 2/5 stars for that reason.

Review: I never thought I'd leave a review wishing for a zero or negative star option, but here we are. I've been to this children's play place more than once, and my previous experience was disappointing due to the cleanliness of the play area and the staff's attitude. We let a Groupon expire because I didn’t want to return. But after my daughter kept asking to go for the last two weeks, I figured we’d give it another shot, hoping it had improved. Unfortunately, it’s worse than ever.

We visited on Saturday, 8/24/24, meeting friends for a playdate when the place opened. After letting the kids (both 5 years old) settle in, we sat down, periodically checking on them. The floors in the seating areas were filthy, covered in shoe and sock prints, and this was right after opening. Then, my daughter came over and told me she stepped on glass. Shocked, I asked her to show me where. Meanwhile, her friend showed her mom a small injury she had gotten while trying to avoid the glass, causing her to fall and land on the glass, which ripped her new leggings and cut her knee, making it bleed.

I walked over and saw glass scattered everywhere near the front windows. Another parent mentioned that their child had found the rock that had clearly broken the window. When my friend asked for a bandaid and the staff saw her daughter's bleeding leg, they told her it had already been cleaned up. I then informed them that was definitely not the case; glass was still all over the mats. This is a play place where kids are required to wear socks only. One child was already bleeding, and that was the staff’s response? A few of us parents started using toys to barricade off the area because the glass had spread over a large area. There was no urgency from the staff; they eventually came over with brooms and said, ""It's not our fault people keep breaking our windows."" True, it’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to maintain a safe environment for the kids.

Despite our concerns, the girls wanted to keep playing, so we kept them away from that area. The staff’s cleaning efforts were inadequate—they didn’t even bother to get a vacuum to clean up the shards of glass on the mats. They removed our barricades. It wasn’t until the owner arrived later that the staff finally brought out a shop vac and sealed the window to clean up the glass properly. Yet, the owner never checked in with my friend to see how her daughter was doing.

When our kids got hungry, we ordered food: one large pizza and an order of chicken spring rolls. The food took a long time to arrive. When I bit into the spring rolls, I found a triangular piece of bone inside the chopped chicken. I took multiple pictures as proof. Then I noticed a rash on my friend’s daughter, which hadn’t been there before. That was the last straw; we decided it was time to go.

This place is a disaster—the staff is terrible, and there’s zero regulation on older kids roughhousing. An older boy, maybe 8-10 years old, was grabbing my daughter’s hands in the ball pit, and I had to intervene calmly. No parents were in sight.

When you go to a play place, there’s an expectation of cleanliness, kindness, and safety—this place has none of those. To top it off, only one sink in the women’s bathroom worked, the paper towel dispenser handle was broken, one toilet was out of order, and another was clogged. The toys, like the large Legos and the balls, were filthy, and even my daughter mentioned that the slides were dirty.

We had to explain to our girls that we were leaving because it wasn’t safe—between the broken glass, the bone in my food, and the rash, it was time to go and never come back. I’ve mentioned this experience to other mom friends, and they all had horrible things to say about this place. I have no idea how this place is still open; it needs to be shut down.

Review: This place is RIDICULOUS! 1. They are very intrusive and want to collect all of your personal information. Who knows where they are selling it.
2. They charge for grandparents & handicap people who are not there to play. They force elderly and handicap people to buy socks and tickets when they just want to sit and watch their grandkids play.
3. OVER priced for the small space kids have to play. The kids get bored with such limited things to do.

No 👎🏻 thanks. They will be out of business soon.

Go to a trampoline park. It's a much better value and kids will have more to do. Plus you won't get knocked over the head with charges just to watch your own kids....

Review: I had heard so much about this place and was excited to take my granddaughter.  I won’t go again.
It is obviously not well maintained at all.  Dirty, and SO many games broken but not marked as such.  Dropped a lot of coins that got us nothing.  Adult pricing seems excessive and to have to buy their socks - though I was sitting at a table the whole time seemed foolish.
Their listing should boldly state their shoes/ socks policy.
Their house keeping needs a royal step up and their employees need to learn some manners.  Disappointing.

Review: Went there for the first time today. Admission is reasonable. Cashier in the front didn’t give us wrist bands so that made leaving confusing. Food was pricey but decent, took almost an hour before we got our food and partially due to them not properly putting phone number in for text notification. Kids had a lot of fun though. I feel like there should be staff walking through checking on kids cause it is a big area and to try to keep balls in their areas as it is a tripping hazard. This area is so big you can lose a kiddo and if they don’t actually check wristbands/neglect to give them then I feel this could be a major safety hazard. I do like that you have unlimited play time though unlike other places we have gone to.

Review: Had a very uncomfortable experience here. Came here with my son my sister and nephew on Memorial Day the man that checked us in gave me a really hard time because we wanted to pay separately instead of together to avoid the additional $7.95 charge for an adult. He made me put my son’s water cup in the dirty shoe bin because water was “not allowed.” Upon entering I noticed water canteens on almost every table so I went back and brought this to his attention where he then gave me my son’s water cup back. Very strange. I’m 7 months pregnant and wanted to take my son to do something fun and in turn I come here just to feel super stressed out and uncomfortable by a grumpy employee. Super disappointing. Bathrooms are completely disgusting as well, brown on the walls in the stall. So it seems that the staff was concerned with my son’s water bottle than anything else! There’s a Wally Wombats not far from this place, way cleaner and friendly customer service.

Review: I can’t comment on their playground because I didn’t get inside. My issue was with their policy on charging adults. I arrived with friends, each accompanied by their own child. When we were asked if we came together, I said yes and offered to pay for everyone, expecting my friends to reimburse me later. Despite each adult having their own child and us all signing waivers, they insisted on charging me for four adults simply because we arrived as a group. I questioned why we had to pay extra when they weren’t providing any additional care for our kids. They replied it was their policy for group arrivals. Frustrated, I requested a refund and went to Kangamoo at Sunset instead.

Review: The positives - The staff were very friendly. The place is large with a good layout.

The negatives - The posted food menu did not match what the cashier was ringing up and she could not change it to match without being up charged.  Waited 45 minutes for a quesadilla and chicken sandwich.  The bathroom was disgusting and we arrived near opening so it was not restocked from the night before or cleaned.  Leaking toilets while wearing socks, there are sandals but no sign if for public use so was unsure who's they were.  The machines for the kids to use in the play area were broken or lacking power to where the balls would not shoot out or power up.  The games seemed expensive, $1 for 2 tokens.

Overall I'd say it was ok.  If they maintained the broken items and cleaned better it would be a five star.

Review: We went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't crazy busy, which I was happy about. It's a very large play place, and sometimes, when it's too busy, the little ones get hurt/run over by older kids. All the kids, for the most part, appeared to be under 6 when I was there.  The jungle gym is big enough that a parent is able to climb through it as well. Seemed pretty clean, didn't go to the restrooms which I hate because you're in socks only. They have some arcade games, but after spending $18 to get in, it can get expensive playing games. The birthday space I wasn't impressed with simply because it's all linked together in one large room.  Just rows of tables, maybe 10 - 15, so you don't have a personal space. You're behind glass separated from the general public, but not from anyone else having a birthday party at the same time. There's plenty of seating available for parents while the kids play, and the snack bar has a nice variety of items. Pricing wise they're high, but it's a play place so I expected it. It was almost $7 for a small slurpee (6 or 8oz I believe) and bottle of water.  The air guns in the playpen weren't working and there are several of them. Looked like no one had checked them to see because balls were stuck in them that weren't intended for the guns. I wasn't able to pull them out, and even guns that had nothing stuck in them weren't working either. Overall, my daughter enjoyed herself so I'd definitely go back.

Review: Calm and relaxing environment where little can freely explore , discover and be curious.
They offer sensory play, micro school and open play.

It’s a great alternative to typical indoor playground where everyone run around and bounce off the walls.

It was perfect for my 4 and 1 year old. And we are already planning to come back soon.

Review: We booked this space for my son’s third birthday and had a wonderful experience. I’m sick of attending birthday parties at play places/trampoline parks that are so overwhelming and overstimulating. This space is set up more like a fun daycare/classroom and was absolutely perfect. It had something for every child.

The kids felt empowered/comfortable enough to explore and find things to play with. Coloring, arts & crafts, play kitchens, cars, dinosaurs, dress up, Duplo Lego, bowling set, a calming/darker corner, and a bounce castle with ball pit. SO MUCH TO DO! But none of it was loud or overwhelming.

There was light music playing and even a gentle water feature with live plants. Seriously so calm and sweet. There were plenty of tables to set up food, refreshments, gifts, etc. - nice blank spaces to decorate and make our own. The restrooms were clean and prepped for kid use with step stools and faucet extenders.

Runa could not have been lovelier. She was so sweet and made booking totally seamless. I would recommend this place to anyone. It was nice to support a local business too! We will be back next year! ❤️

I was surprised to know my son knew her name. I wasnt sure how much he actually paid attention but he enjoys her weekely classes which peaks his curiosity and allows him to engage at his own pace. He is more comfortable around other kids now and excited to participate in circle time. Anyone looking for supplemental activites for those home schooled or even a bridge between enrolling in preschool should definately check out open play, booking a birthday party or registering for a class.

When it was time to make the final payment, I requested a proper invoice, but all they provided were screenshots and receipts. I specifically asked for an invoice that reflected my deposit, which they refused to provide. Despite my attempts to communicate with the owners for a clear breakdown of the payments, they canceled my party, claiming the payment wasn’t made. To make matters worse, I received multiple text messages from them before 7 a.m. The owners are unprofessional, rude, and lack basic communication skills, especially over the phone.

Review: Unfortunately we had a really awful experience at Yuzu and Space, and I don't recommend booking a birthday party here. I hosted my daughter's birthday party here after speaking with the owner, Rhuna extensively beforehand she promised activities like painting  and making friendship bracelets. Unfortunately, neither of these activities took place. The owner (again Rhuna), who was extemely friendly when we arrived, disappeared into a back office and barely interacted with us.

The party was supposed to last a total of three hours, but I cut it short by over an hour because of the owner's behavior. After two hours or so of hiding in the back, she emerged extremely angry because the kids had made a mess. These were small children 2-4 year olds without any guidance or structured activities, which she had promised to provide. Instead of getting defensive I apologized and I tried to help clean up, but her negative energy made everyone feel unwelcome. She was scowling and giving off a horrible vibe and I became worried she would cause a scene.

I had also purchased a piñata with her approval to schedule that at the end of the party, but we didn't get to use it because we had cut the party short. Rhuna became very aggressive towards my husband, and I was so embarrassed in front of our guests that I left to wait in the car. I didn't want my daughter to know anything was wrong, so I didn't want to complain in front of her or have her realize we were leaving early. My husband paid the full amount and we just asked our guests to leave without much explanation because they all realized she was making a problem.

To make matters worse the owner later posted on social media, complaining about us. She never communicated any expectations of parents or asked us to do something different beforehand. Instead, she hid in her office and suddenly came out without warning, seemingly perturbed.

We were told we would have a fun birthday party with painting and bracelet crafts, and I assumed there would be helpers to set this up and guide the kids. Despite the lack of promised activities, I didn't complain because I just wanted the kids to have fun and they were having a good time. I hope the owner can learn to communicate and plan better, but we certainly won't be back. I have been to many birthday parties for friends kids and planned my kid's at many locations and never once was anyone treated this way. My intention was to support a new local business and try out a new place but it turned into an unfortunate and embarrassing fiasco.

Review: We love this place, we do the monthly membership and end up here at least once a week. Our 5 year old totally loves it there. The owner is the sweetest and loves to play with the kids. It is still your responsibility to watch over and clean up after your child. It’s great place to go if you have little ones that aren’t in school yet but need something fun for them to do while the older ones are in school Or somewhere to escape our  weather. The seating and tables, along with the sensory area and crafts are switched up pretty regularly. So it feels new and different every time we visit. It’s a great small business that we love to support. I’m sure any young family would love it as much as we do.

Review: Adorable indoor play center that is perfect for 2-5 year olds. The owner is so kind and caring, and she has all the Montessori and holiday themed projects you see on social media but rarely end up doing at home. My daughter is three and we stayed for well over an hour rotating through all the fun areas, but she could have stayed much longer. Everything is very well thought out, and there is just enough to keep kids busy but not feel overwhelmed by too much stuff. They also do parties, which I think would be awesome for this age range. We will be back for sure!

Review: Fun playground for young kids: newborn and prewalker area has bouncers and jumpers to entertain the little ones while the older kids have a two story obstacle course with a slide and ballpit. Dollhouse, dress up costumes, train sets, several playhouses and tons of ride on cars. Big plus for allowing outside food/ snacks to keep the kids happy for hours before getting hangry!

Review: Very cute little place for toddlers wish some of the parents that brought kids there had more respect for the place. It’s annoying to watch parents let their kids destroy things intentionally and barely say a word to them. I feel for the front desk who did ask the kids to stop even though it’s the parents responsibility to keep their kid in check and not just ignore what’s happening.

Review: This is a very toddler-friendly place, so if you have a child under 5, it’s a great option. However, it may not be as engaging for older kids. Since my son is 1, I find it better suited for us compared to other places. Another big advantage is that they have workstations for parents, with desks and chairs, which is fantastic. I can sometimes get work done while keeping an eye on my child playing nearby. The space is also not too large, making it easier to keep track of my kid because I can spot him quickly. Another perk I appreciate is that they allow outside food and drinks, so I can easily feed my son during playtime.

Review: I went to Wigglin' out with my girls the other day. While they did have fun, I dont think we'll be returning. Nothing seemed very clean, lots of damaged or broken toys, and toys not in their correct place (and not being returned to their home by staff in the 2 hours we were there.) The poor girl at the front seemed to be alone, handling everything. I get it, she can only do so much. With that, there were also issues of enforcing rules. There were kids eating in the play area, running, taking off socks, and a child almost leaving the building, which I, personally, had to stop and console him while trying to keep track of my own kids. If the price was half as much as Kangamoo, Wally Wombats, or Kids Town I could see past all these things but for the same price, we'll drive a little farther to go someplace that is more kept up.

Review: Today we visited Wigglin’ Out Indoor Playground LV and the girls had a great time!

If I find a play area that allows them to play while I can sit and decompress, it's always a win. I would say that this play area is great for kids 6 and under based on the size of the toys and space inside of the play area. Bring your own socks, or you can purchase them for only $2/pair. Very clean as well. Friendly staff.

Review: Both my kids (ages 1 & 4) love Wigglin out! We have been coming here for years.

Wigglin Out is a smaller indoor playground, geared towards younger kids, which I love, because some of the bigger playgrounds are overwhelming for toddlers. The facility is locally owned, spotlessly clean, and the owners/staff are so kind.

Wigglin Out is also one of the most reasonably priced indoor playgrounds in Vegas, and they run great specials and host fun events. This is definitely one of our favorite spots for the whole family.

Review: We were in Vegas for a week (end of August) and attended this facility about 4-5 times. We had a fantastic experience. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Most importantly, the facility is more intimate and not as loud/hectic as other indoor playgrounds.

There are plenty of different toys for children to experience. We really valued that the size was more intimate (it made our children less distracted and not as over stimulated as the louder, super bright/neon/flashy places) but most importantly, this Wigglin' Out is OPEN EARLIER than all the other places.

The earlier open hours were key because most children are up early so to have to wait until 11 am to start burning off energy is too close to lunch/nap times. Now keep in mind, we were visiting from Canada so I recognize that earlier weekday hours may not be as important for locals.

But for us, as tourists, this venue was excellent: wonderful customer service, more calm/intimate setting, and better opening hours.

Review: My experience with Wigglin' Out has been a fantastic experience. Chris, the owner, is great with all of the families that enter into the facility. We are all like family in his eyes. He keeps the center clean and organized. The children have a wonderful time and enjoy playing with each other. It is a perfect place to take my toddler as well as take a break and watch her play. I am a first time parent. Finding places that are made just for her is a little bit hard. This place has ample space for the children to explore yet small enough for me to keep my eyes on my little one, while sitting down. I continue to come became my little one loves it so much. It's were she gets her wiggles out. Thank you Chris for always being wonderful to my family. We truly appreciate it!

Review: This place is great. I’ve been bringing my daughter since she was 11 months old. They have a young toddler section that is somewhat blocked off and you can safely trap your baby in there. Now that my daughter is 20 months she has so much fun running around, jumping, sliding and playing in the ball pit.
This place is a lot cleaner than other indoor playgrounds and I like that it’s not too big so I can keep my eye on her but also give her some space to play.
They have comfy couches for parents and an eating area so the kids can enjoy their snacks. The other great thing is you don’t pay by the hour so you can really let your kids burn off all their energy.

Clean play area and clean snack/sitting area for the parents. We’ve been back twice now and I plan on purchasing the 10 passes for $85 or the monthly plan. It wasn’t posted anywhere that you had to pay 3 months upfront for the monthly plan (which was $60 or $65 per month, I believe) so heads up on that.

Review: So my 14 month old bit someone’s child and I apologized, I was supervising my child through all the time he was playing and apologized to parents if my baby was being hyper active or doing smth wrong. He was very excited to see other children. So this mom complained to the front desk about my child instead of making a connection with me and maybe get our children play together. Like cmon my child is still a baby and I’m doing my best to teach him the right way and it’s not like every parent is perfect, we all make mistakes when educating our children. The front desk person was telling me to supervise my child better and tell him the right way to behave. I’m trying to do my mom job and I have a very active baby and I get tired too. I was told in a rude manner as though saying we are not welcomed back. Especially the other mom was a regular customer. I could become a regular Cust too. I need my money back please

Review: I think limiting the amount of people that come in to allow for more access to the games at any given time. If we pay for two hours, trying to play all the games in that timeline is not feasible. I bought unlimited drinks for my team, and the bartenders were extremely slow and rude, it was almost because we had a drink band they were less interested in serving us and preferred to give more attention to patrons buying single drinks at a time. You had great games that were often broken, so we had to come back to play. It would be a more enjoyable  experience with a few tweaks the major one being the amount of people. Maybe do colored bands based on time so they can have security moving people to the bar areas to either eat or drink only so that new waves of people can try the games??? The other thing that was not enjoyable was the sales process. The rep Deborah farmer was rude, unhelpful and seemed annoyed with any questions. When we showed up the door staff was rude and kept asking me ""regular or VIP""- to which I replied ""its a corporate event"", they didn't offer assistance or information they kept repeating ""regular or VIP"", like a mocking bird. It was horrible. I will continue to deter people from this place. clearly you only cater to tourists and have zero interest in local customers.

Review: This place was great when it first opened up. I hadn't been in a few years, and took my three kids last week. The employees do a good job of keeping everything picked up and clean on the surface... But this place needs a deep cleaning BAD! The entire playground area had a faint smell of urine, and everything has a layer of grime on it. I was really iffy about letting my one year old climb on things, and sure enough he ended up sick. Half the stuff was broken (one of the trampolines, the zipline, etc), BUT, my kids still had a blast. In all honesty though, I'll probably just choose a different playground next time that I know is very clean.

They also sell diapers for the little ones and all three bathrooms have changing tables. I will definitely be coming back here every time I am in Las Vegas.

Review: This playground has honestly been the worst experience for my daughter . My daughter has gotten sick here multiple times , they aren’t very sanitary , I’ve been missing months for it to be better but nope workers sitting on their bum selfs on their phones not cleaning play area at all some how it gets dirtier each day it’s a socks only howww ? yes I understand it’s a playground for children but it’s also very hazardous , there’s a lot of broken things , broken steps and a window where my daughter was about to fall from . There’s been so many concerns for me , children aggressively pushing my daughter , calling her stupid , mothers fighting amongst each other , the staff works for nothing and doesn’t ever intervene . I’ve escalated my concerns with the owner and she has shown no interest whatsoever, instead of providing solutions for her playground she just says her workers aren’t police officers ? She has also mentioned that she plans on not having any maintenance done to the playground not even within a year as she also made it known that she was the cheapest and best in town and actually planned on raising her prices , you can’t even express your concerns to the workers because you get strikes as a customer ? She has also just said other places are better than hers while giving the excuse of her playground being old ? Half of the place is torn down lady. Overall such an awful option , I originally opted towards this playground because of how conveniently close it was to my house but I will be resorting to anything and everything else for the best experience for my daughter . I had the year membership and gave these issues time to be resolved and they just worsened . I recommend Wally Wombats , it’s only $5 more for the annual membership and it’s an overall better alternative . Good Luck to kangamoo

Review: Kangamoo Indoor Playground on Sunset Road in Las Vegas proved to be the perfect spot for a fun day with the little ones. Centrally located and easy to access, it’s filled with exciting activities geared toward younger children. The playground is very clean and well-maintained, which immediately put us at ease as the kids explored the slides, climbing structures, and interactive areas. They enjoyed every minute, darting from one play zone to the next with endless energy. The welcoming environment and thoughtful setup made this a delightful outing for everyone.

Review: No compassion, no kindness. My one year old was crying desperately and I was just trying to feed him with ONE GRAPE to calm him, but immediately they told me that outside food wasn’t allowed inside (only their junk food of course). They couldn’t wait for the baby to calm down. Also, this employee was always speaking on the speakers telling kids what not to do. Very annoying. If in spaces for kids there’s no compassion and kindness, where are we supposed to go?
It’s a nice structure though, and I bet with different management it would be a great place for kids.

Review: Brought our little one here during our short trip to Vegas. This place is a life saver for us and our restless 21 month old! It’s located just 10 minutes off the strip and next to the airport.

Things we loved:
-PLENTY of toys and a great variety too
-An extensive play gym
-Several trampolines
-Kid friendly restrooms that were easily accessible
-plenty of seating for parents following their little ones around the play gym
-Two massage chairs for parents
-An elliptical
-Food available for purchase
-Cubbies and lockers

Our son didn’t have socks but thankfully we were able to purchase them on site.

Our son had so much fun here. We will be back for sure during our next annual trip to Vegas.

Review: The toys, floors, and climbing areas are caked in dirt, looks like they haven't been cleaned in a long time.

The snack selection is poor, nothing healthy at all just chips and pizza.

We ended up getting sick as well a few days after going here, likely because nothing was cleaned.

Also saw multiple kids bullying other kids with no parent intervention, lots of yelling and screaming while the parents sit and scroll on their phones.

Overall, WAY too many kids at once, there should be a limit. Poor food selections, everything is dirty, I mean my daughter's hands were black from climbing up the playground..just gross and not worth the money at all.

We stayed for over 2 hours, and neither one was bored the whole time. There is a bigger kids section and a little kids section. The employees were friendly, helpful, and engaging! They even played with my little guy, and he had so much fun. Throughout our visit, I kept seeing employees constantly cleaning and disinfecting toys and common areas. I highly recommend this place, and my older boy is already asking to go back before we leave!

Review: DANGER! Don't Bring Your Little Kids Here!
I brought my 3 year old here today and it's full of adults barreling down the slides head-first (without kids) and teenagers bullying little kids on the trampoline. The big kids - far too old to be there were boisterous and dangerous, pushing little ones over. It isn't a place for little kids.

Not to mention there were FAR too many people in there - clearly part-time parents and their family members. There should be limits to two adults per kid.
There was a 350lb man up on the climbing frame net area making the whole thing creak and shake and the useless TEEN staff (clearly management doesn't want to pay adults!) couldn't manage anything. It is a matter of time until that comes down on someone's head.

The whole place is a disaster and danger to children. There should be an upper age restriction on how old kids can be to enter - it's not a place for the over 10s and this was being exploited because of the useless management.

The running around of a 5-year-old does not have the same momentum as a ten-year-old running around, ploughing into little ones. Again, the little mouse voices from 'management' did nothing and the trash parents were more interested in their phones than watching their kids. Upon entry, they should be spoken to about watching their kids, not to let them bully and over tens should be turned away.

Also, their toxic stamp takes 60 years to remove and will make my kid's arm red in the bathtub, trying to get it off.

Avoid. At all costs. It's a matter of time until a kid is really hurt - or worse at this clown show and they get sued into oblivion regardless of their stupid waiver or signs, that no one reads.
If I could rate it minus stars, I would.
We will never be back and we'll be telling other parents to avoid the place too.

They have untrained employees, no managers on site and give out party contract details to anyone who asks even without permission from someone who booked the party. I would recommend visiting a different location if you would like your child to have a good time as this one is unprofessional. Also they no longer serve food for parties even with signs everywhere saying they have food.

Review: I was there for the first time on December 19th and the entire team on that day was super helpful. So I went back on December 20th and to my disappointment, the two attendants who are in the courtyard were exclusively looking after a single child and that same child wanted me to take my daughter out of Jump so she could feel comfortable. obviously I didn't take it away, it's a collective space. Then these two attendants went down the slide with that same child. They were taking exclusive care of her and in the end they even made a balloon flower, ignoring all the children who were in the space. Then my daughter chose a snack, but I was without my wallet waiting for my husband to arrive in 10 minutes and the attendant was super rude saying that I couldn't open the snack package without first having to pay $1. My daughter is autistic and was very upset by the situation. If I paid $14 why wouldn't I pay $1. and he was still mocking. I will not return to this place again.

Review: We went here for a 3 year old birthday party and we were beyond impressed. We have been to a few parties with our little dude and this place had the most to offer of the places we've been. Lots of space with different toys, attentive staff, lots of places to sit and supervise, and it did not feel overly crowded at all. We would love to do our kid's next birthday here.

Review: ***WARNING*** Worst Birthday Party experience ever......

We booked the party in Aug. For today Nov. 11th. At the time of booking I was told IF more than 15 kids showed I would be charged for the 22 child count party. OK not a problem.

I was also told we would get 2 full hours in the party room.

When I arrived today I was CHARGED for the 22 child party as soon as I walk through the door. They did not even wait for the head count. Then also asked for a TIP. Right as we arrived.

The employees could have cared less about helping us set up the party!!!

The ""party host"" with the party was virtually none existent. We did basically everything ourselves from set up to clean up!

When the party was about over we were told to vacate the party room before the party for even over. BEFORE the 2 hour mark! The hostess finally showed up and said we could stay additional time for another $50.00.

When I went to the cashier she number 1 refused to give us out money back because it was a 15 child party not 22.

Secondly, she refused to give us an additional few mintues in the party room that the hostess communicated we could pay for.

NOT one person was kind or courteous. There was very poor communication. We were for lack of better terms over charged for the party head count.

Not a family friendly or good customer service experience at all.

When I asked to speak with a manager I was told I had to wait until Monday and call them.

Despite Kangamoos extremely poor customer service. We tipped the one person who did check on us well.

Needless to say, unless this very Bad experience is addressed.  NONE of us at the party plan to visit this establishment again in the future.

Dear manager. Call Me! Signed an overcharged patron!

I will gladly update this review IF management contacts me to corrext this wrong and experience. B Because they will deserve a kudos for effort. I have to wait until Monday to talk with anyone.

Review: I purchased a punch pass for a Christmas gift and had my purse stolen and therefore the punch pass. They refuse to give me a new pass (and you can clearly tell the pass has never been used) or refund the $95 spent on it. I was shrugged at and told they’ve had people have their whole cars stolen and won’t replace it. We will not be back and will not support a place that operates like this. What’s the point of having us sign a log book upon purchase of the pass if you can’t track it? I’m a Nanny that has been here with lots of kids here and we will not be back.

Review: It is a good place to take kids. It has slides, things to climb up and down, multiple cars to ride for the little ones, and multiple play houses. It has a play area for all age kids and an area to color, draw, write, and read. There is a rest area for parents while observing kids from a distance. It has 4 free massage chairs for exhausted parents, and I liked it. They also have snacks and pizzas to buy.

He got to dance, ride bikes, and tumble in a safe environment and the hospitality of the staff was spot on the entire time. They kept checking in on us, made sure we had everything we needed the whole time and I didn’t have to do anything! That was the best part for me. I got to love on him and really enjoy the moment with him. 10 out of 10 experience. Would definitely recommend and we will be there again! Can’t thank you enough for an amazing day. 🤗

The kids had an absolute blast playing in the playground. It was awesome to have a separate area for the little kids to play in as well!  Thank you, Planet Kid!

Review: Came on a Monday, and I think school was out, so the place was extremely busy and loud. This is a fun place to bring your kids! But everything is coated with a brown grime of dirt and is pretty gross. Just make sure kids wash their hands after! There was also a man named Mr. Michael, I’m not sure if he was part of a group or was one of the workers, but he was very unkindly yelling at children and putting them in time out! I was horrified that he was treating the children the way he was! He made quite the scene as kids sat there on the bench and he reprimanded them.

Please avoid taking your kids here. Planet kid please invest in cleaners, new toys that aren’t black from germs and filth, vacuuming, wiping items down etc. I’m disgusted this business is even in business

Review: We LOVE to come and visit Plant Kid. My daughter and I hadn't been able to come in awhile so it was the first time we came after the remodel. We stood around and waited to get helped at the front door for over 5 minutes. The person who worked there walked around the corner on his phone and couldn't even act bothered by the fact that we stood their. I'm not gonna lie I almost just let my little one(16 months old) go and play. We were so excited to see what they had changed with the toddler room and it looked so good! I only wish that my little one could actually enjoy it and not get ran over by the older kid that wasn't suppose to be in there... definitely loved the remodel and I'm hoping to come back but it's going to be a minute... definitely sad that it was ruined by the employees lack of care...

Review: I have to give 5 stars for the staff alone. We had a mix up on our party date (I showed up a day earlier than they had on their schedule) and they didn’t even hesitate to jump into action and accommodate us. I know this wouldn’t always be possible, but they were able to make it happen and literally saved the day. Everyone was kind and warm and so helpful!! Thank you so, so much to the staff for being incredible! Additionally, the facility is clean and the playground is a blast for kids while parents can watch from a safe distance. Everyone from my 18 month old (LOVE the toddler area) to my 8 year old had a great time.

Review: This place was nice and my kids loved it to be honest. Only down side was the interaction we had with 1 employee. Long story short we went upstairs to sit down after being cramped in one of the downstairs room for a hour. I asked the young lady if the private parties were over and she told me yes, they ended at 330. So we grabbed all our stuff and headed upstairs. About 30 minutes later, my partner had someone very politely come up to her and explain more parties were coming and that we need to go downstairs, she complied with no problem. My partner starts to tell me that we need to leave( I didn’t hear conversation ) but we are interrupted by the original employee who told me that the parties were over. She starts repeatedly telling us we can’t be upstairs, and asking if we were apart if a party. We told her no, that we are leaving. She repeats the same questions over again, with her voice raised louder, so finally I said I heard you the first 3 times, we are leaving. And that We paid 50 dollars to be here, we thought we could sit anywhere we like. She finally backs off and we quickly go downstairs. After we make it back downstairs, the original young lady who told us more parties are coming, comes up and apologies for the way her coworker talked to us. She felt so bad that she gave us free admission tickets too. To end this long story, maybe Planet Kid shouldn’t book 75% of the place up, and make the people not there for a party sit in a tiny room cramped together. Maybe just book the upstairs, and be very clear you can’t sit up there if you are not apart of a party. Shout out to the young lady who eased over the situation.

Review: BEWARE OF PLANET KIDS IN BOISE BY COSTCO!!
I took my son to Planet Kid yesterday for the first time. I took my niece there years ago and never was told about a waiver. Fast forward the employee yesterday never told me I had to sign anything.
I went up with my son on the jungle gym. We went down the pink slide, he went first. When I went down my braid hooked on a screw that was lose from the top. It yanked a chunck of my hair out and my neck hurts today. I'm concerned about the future kids who go down this slide. They put a piece of duct tape on the screw even though the employee said it should have some padding on it also.
Called to talk to a manager today. She was extremely RUDE, explained it's on the list for the maintance person to fix but kids are still using this slide. She never said sorry for it happeneing but rather scolded me for not signing a waiver that was in a binder with a fuzzy pink pen that the employee never brought to my attention when I paid. We went round and round with that one. Ultimately with the manager saying it's the parent's responsibility.
I don't recommend this place!!!!

Review: Excellent place for kiddos 4-8y. We brought our daughter here when she was 2.5y and there wasn't a whole lot she could do, but as soon as she was bigger at 3-4y, she was climbing all over the place! We are very impressed with the level and amount of obstacles in this space. There's plenty of challenge here as well. Really great place to get that energy out and working on problem solving skills with how to get through the obstacles. Our daughter is very adventurous and has always had a wonderful time. Great snack bar too, plus nice seating area. Would be a great place for a small (~10 kids) birthday party!

Review: Took my one year old here twice. The first time it was a very busy Saturday and the 2 and under zone was filled with big kids that kept hurting him (mostly on accident) but I figured it was just a crazy busy day so we tried coming again on a calm weekday when it was almost empty. All the older kids were still in the 2 and under area. Employees don’t keep an eye on this area and parents don’t tell their kids not to come in. Usually the older kids are running around not looking and jumping in the ball pit. My one year old was trampled a couple of times. Very disappointed because he really was having so much fun but it’s just not a safe space, they need to control the 2 and under area.

The pretzels were frozen so when they thaw and bake they are like rubber, the cheese for them cost extra and it has no flavor, so if you ask me would I return for the kids to have fun hell yeah. Would I ever eat here again? Nope. I'd rather smuggle food in my purse then eat her again. Just not good at all.

It seems like no one ever wipes the play areas down so be sure to replace your socks and clean you hands when you get home. If this continues I can’t continue coming here, especially with things falling apart more and more

Review: This playground has honestly been the worst experience for my daughter . My daughter has gotten sick here multiple times , they aren’t very sanitary , I’ve been missing months for it to be better but nope workers sitting on their bum selfs on their phones not cleaning play area at all some how it gets dirtier each day it’s a socks only howww ? yes I understand it’s a playground for children but it’s also very hazardous , there’s a lot of broken things , broken steps and a window where my daughter was about to fall from . There’s been so many concerns for me , children aggressively pushing my daughter , calling her stupid , mothers fighting amongst each other , the staff works for nothing and doesn’t ever intervene . I’ve escalated my concerns with the owner and she has shown no interest whatsoever, instead of providing solutions for her playground she just says her workers aren’t police officers ? She has also mentioned that she plans on not having any maintenance done to the playground not even within a year as she also made it known that she was the cheapest and best in town and actually planned on raising her prices , you can’t even express your concerns to the workers because you get strikes as a customer ? She has also just said other places are better than hers while giving the excuse of her playground being old ? Half of the place is torn down lady. Overall such an awful option , I originally opted towards this playground because of how conveniently close it was to my house but I will be resorting to anything and everything else for the best experience for my daughter . I had the year membership and gave these issues time to be resolved and they just worsened . I recommend Wally Wombats , it’s only $5 more for the annual membership and it’s an overall better alternative . Good Luck to kangamoo

Shortly after I bought a couple bags of chips and gave cash which was put underneath the counter. Posting here because there is no one to call. Employee possibly stealing. Hope I’m wrong.

Review: This place was great when it first opened up. I hadn't been in a few years, and took my three kids last week. The employees do a good job of keeping everything picked up and clean on the surface... But this place needs a deep cleaning BAD! The entire playground area had a faint smell of urine, and everything has a layer of grime on it. I was really iffy about letting my one year old climb on things, and sure enough he ended up sick. Half the stuff was broken (one of the trampolines, the zipline, etc), BUT, my kids still had a blast. In all honesty though, I'll probably just choose a different playground next time that I know is very clean.

Review: This is an amazing place for you to play with your children indoors out of the heat! You can crawl around on the play structure with your kids or babies, push your kids in play cars, let them draw, or paint their nails! The place is designed for the adults too. It's $10 per kid, but the accompanying adults are free. You can sit in comfy chairs, work on your laptop with free WiFi, or go get a free massage in one of their 4 full body massage chairs! It was amazing! They also have free coffee, tea and water and areas to eat with your kids. My 1 year old had a blast crawling around and watching kids play everywhere. I had fun too and seriously enjoyed my massage! We're going to get a 10 punch pass the next time we go, which is $75, so we can visit regularly.

Review: We booked the semi private party option for our son's 2nd birthday. The kids loved it! We were so comfortable letting them play freely because we did book the room for the event towards closing time so the kids had the entire playground ground to themselves so it was PERFECT. I am definitely booking here again. Only thing that did bug me a bit was that we were told we would get help to set up and help throughout the event such as a reminder for time management for cake cutting etc. Yea we got none of that. Whenever we ran out of plates or napkins we had to go look for someone to get them & when we did get more we would get about 10 napkins at a time & a few plates at a time as well. So not much help at all. Which it is explained that you WILL have someone helping you but that's a lie.

Review: Another great place to escape the summer heat of Vegas and let your kids get out of the house. It's a bit out of the way but totally worth the drive. Big enough and varied enough to keep the kids busy but not so big you'll be worried or lose them. You can climb around with the kids or relax in the parent lounge. Your choice! Bring socks though you can't play without them. Even you as a parent need to wear socks!

Review: Kangamoo Indoor Playground on Sunset Road in Las Vegas proved to be the perfect spot for a fun day with the little ones. Centrally located and easy to access, it’s filled with exciting activities geared toward younger children. The playground is very clean and well-maintained, which immediately put us at ease as the kids explored the slides, climbing structures, and interactive areas. They enjoyed every minute, darting from one play zone to the next with endless energy. The welcoming environment and thoughtful setup made this a delightful outing for everyone.

My one year old was crying desperately and I was just trying to feed him with ONE GRAPE to calm him, but immediately they told me that outside food wasn’t allowed inside (only their junk food of course). They couldn’t wait for the baby to calm down. Also, this employee was always speaking on the speakers telling kids what not to do. Very annoying. If in spaces for kids there’s no compassion and kindness, where are we supposed to go?
It’s a nice structure though, and I bet with different management it would be a great place for kids.

Review: The toys, floors, and climbing areas are caked in dirt, looks like they haven't been cleaned in a long time.

The snack selection is poor, nothing healthy at all just chips and pizza.

We ended up getting sick as well a few days after going here, likely because nothing was cleaned.

Also saw multiple kids bullying other kids with no parent intervention, lots of yelling and screaming while the parents sit and scroll on their phones.

Overall, WAY too many kids at once, there should be a limit. Poor food selections, everything is dirty, I mean my daughter's hands were black from climbing up the playground..just gross and not worth the money at all.

There was trash everywhere and food crumbs. I also bought a toy since I didn't feel comfortable with my baby playing and trying to put stuff in her mouth and it was full of dust. I had to wash it. Staff were just standing around no one was cleaning. It was stinky! Kids weren't supervised.first and last time here! Not worth 10$. Mat floor was extremely dirty. Bathrooms were a mess. Massage chairs were damaged I sat in it for five minutes or so when I got up an exposed sharp metal got my leg. I saw a women sneezing into her hands and then touching the kids toys! 🤢 so gross I was freaking out I took my kids after my daughter saw the character which was the whole reason we went. I changed them in the car and washed their hands. Never again doing this terrible nasty place! I only got pictures on the way out I was to busy making sure my kiddos didn't pick up or touch anything in there. Also the grey couch had a throw pillow with stained with what looked like blood and something yellow.

Review: DANGER! Don't Bring Your Little Kids Here!
I brought my 3 year old here today and it's full of adults barreling down the slides head-first (without kids) and teenagers bullying little kids on the trampoline. The big kids - far too old to be there were boisterous and dangerous, pushing little ones over. It isn't a place for little kids.

Not to mention there were FAR too many people in there - clearly part-time parents and their family members. There should be limits to two adults per kid.
There was a 350lb man up on the climbing frame net area making the whole thing creak and shake and the useless TEEN staff (clearly management doesn't want to pay adults!) couldn't manage anything. It is a matter of time until that comes down on someone's head.

The whole place is a disaster and danger to children. There should be an upper age restriction on how old kids can be to enter - it's not a place for the over 10s and this was being exploited because of the useless management.

The running around of a 5-year-old does not have the same momentum as a ten-year-old running around, ploughing into little ones. Again, the little mouse voices from 'management' did nothing and the trash parents were more interested in their phones than watching their kids. Upon entry, they should be spoken to about watching their kids, not to let them bully and over tens should be turned away.

Also, their toxic stamp takes 60 years to remove and will make my kid's arm red in the bathtub, trying to get it off.

Avoid. At all costs. It's a matter of time until a kid is really hurt - or worse at this clown show and they get sued into oblivion regardless of their stupid waiver or signs, that no one reads.
If I could rate it minus stars, I would.
We will never be back and we'll be telling other parents to avoid the place too.

Review: I was there for the first time on December 19th and the entire team on that day was super helpful. So I went back on December 20th and to my disappointment, the two attendants who are in the courtyard were exclusively looking after a single child and that same child wanted me to take my daughter out of Jump so she could feel comfortable. obviously I didn't take it away, it's a collective space. Then these two attendants went down the slide with that same child. They were taking exclusive care of her and in the end they even made a balloon flower, ignoring all the children who were in the space. Then my daughter chose a snack, but I was without my wallet waiting for my husband to arrive in 10 minutes and the attendant was super rude saying that I couldn't open the snack package without first having to pay $1. My daughter is autistic and was very upset by the situation. If I paid $14 why wouldn't I pay $1. and he was still mocking. I will not return to this place again.

Review: Roughly $70 for 2 adults,  3 children and three personal loan pizzas. Not bad. My kids range from 1 to 11 and they all love this place. My only issue is that they are supposed to stamp everyone in your party this way the kids can't leave with the wrong family, however; my 1 year old 4 year old failed to get stamped. I walked past the counter where a worker should have stopped my son, but when I turned around he was standing right behind me and I didn't even know it. Long story short, make sure to watch your kids. They can skip away easily here. Otherwise, it's a pleasant experience.

We were very happy with our choice. It's so nice to pay only for the child. They stamp each adult and child and check before leaving which is a nice safety measure. All staff were attentive and kind. I enjoyed watching staff interact and play with children throughout our visit. When redirecting kids they did so in a pleasant manner. I saw reviews complaining about snacks but we found that they had a variety which included some pretty healthy options at fair prices. It got busy at midday but most parents were supervising and our grandson enjoyed playing with the other kids. If we have opportunity we will definitely return. Restrooms were clean and we did enjoy each taking a turn in a massage chair while the other played.

They wouldn't let my son leave with their mom bc she didn't have the stamp and I needed to be present to show mine.  I really liked that and provided a nice since of security to know that a person couldn't walk off with a child.

They have a big window where you can see planes taking off from the airport but the insulation is so good you can hear a thing. There are 4 massage chairs for weary parents that my wife and I gladly took advantage off and thankfully use was included in the price. Along with many seating options for adults who need somewhere to plug in or a couch to just sit down and take a breather. The actual play area was very spacious with 2 trampolines, several slides, and many more nooks and crannies where adults can fit but kids enjoy climbing around in. All around I will definitely come here again as my daughter keeps asking for me to take her again. Just remember to wear socks and no saddles allowed!

Review: ***WARNING*** Worst Birthday Party experience ever......

We booked the party in Aug. For today Nov. 11th. At the time of booking I was told IF more than 15 kids showed I would be charged for the 22 child count party. OK not a problem.

I was also told we would get 2 full hours in the party room.

When I arrived today I was CHARGED for the 22 child party as soon as I walk through the door. They did not even wait for the head count. Then also asked for a TIP. Right as we arrived.

The employees could have cared less about helping us set up the party!!!

The ""party host"" with the party was virtually none existent. We did basically everything ourselves from set up to clean up!

When the party was about over we were told to vacate the party room before the party for even over. BEFORE the 2 hour mark! The hostess finally showed up and said we could stay additional time for another $50.00.

When I went to the cashier she number 1 refused to give us out money back because it was a 15 child party not 22.

Secondly, she refused to give us an additional few mintues in the party room that the hostess communicated we could pay for.

NOT one person was kind or courteous. There was very poor communication. We were for lack of better terms over charged for the party head count.

Not a family friendly or good customer service experience at all.

When I asked to speak with a manager I was told I had to wait until Monday and call them.

Despite Kangamoos extremely poor customer service. We tipped the one person who did check on us well.

Needless to say, unless this very Bad experience is addressed.  NONE of us at the party plan to visit this establishment again in the future.

Dear manager. Call Me! Signed an overcharged patron!

I will gladly update this review IF management contacts me to corrext this wrong and experience. B Because they will deserve a kudos for effort. I have to wait until Monday to talk with anyone.

Review: We take our son here multiple times a week, if not every day. He absolutely loves it here, has made tons of friends, and has actually learned how to do and say things he never knew about before. My son is almost 2 years old, and I feel like Kangamoo has had an AMAZING impact upon his personality, his progress in learning the basics of absolutely everything, his social life, and his confidence. The employees are VERY nice- wonderful people, and I haven't met one that hasn't been awesome, and very helpful. Also, they offer 4 FREE massage chairs for the parents! They offer toys for sale for the kids, give free balloon animals, have people come by dressed up as their mascot, as well as other performers some times, and I've done my research- these guys have THE best prices in all of Vegas. Their year ticket is the way to go if you plan on coming back. Their playground is adaptable for children between the ages of under 1 year (crawling) and even up to 6 or even 7, maybe higher, depending upon the children's level of interest in playhouses, tunnels, slides, costumes, games, play cars, etc. Overall, I recommend them over any other indoor playground in all of Las Vegas.

Review: The place was fun for my kids, but my main concern was that even though the website says they close at 5:00 on Saturdays, the staff shut off the lights in the play area at 4:45, which is not safe for the kids! My kids were freaking out because they couldn't see me and didn't know what was going on! When I asked staff why they did that, they said it was to help get everyone out and to set up for a party. They said they made an announcement, but you can't hear announcements in there with all the kids! They shouldn't close before the stated time, and they certainly shouldn't turn off the lights on the kids!

Review: If you have kids, you have to bring them here. It's really inexpensive and the design if the property is really intricate and immersive. The place is normally pretty packed with kids but it gives them a chance to get off the screens and play with other children in a safe controlled environment. You can rent out party rooms for large groups. There's snacks available to be purchased. And a whole section for adults to relax while the kids have fun. You really can't go wrong.

This place is still amazing. We came back 2 years after our original review. They have since added many new things to keep the place relevant and exciting. We have also added one to our family since our last visit. She is 1 and had an absolute blast climbing, sliding, and playing with toys. This place really is great!

Original Review
Ok, this is the best place to go with kids. The playground is huge and they made it so you can play with your kids! I'm 6'4"" and 215 pounds and I was able to navigate it with my 2 year old just fine. While my daughter played with the kitchen set, I sat in the massage chair for 20 minutes. The same type that you would pay 10 bucks at the mall, is complimentary for parents. Then, I enjoyed some free coffee and my daughter did crafts. After 3 hours, my daughter was nice and tired! For ten bucks, you couldn't ask for more!

Review: Really fun! Meant for kids under 10, but I had fun at 15! The playground is big enough for adults and kids alike to play. It costs $10 for kids 10 and  under 10 to play for 3 hours (but no one checks so you can really play as long as you want) and everyone 11+ and under 12 months is free. There's the regular indoor climbing area, which is pretty huge. A bunch of tiny play houses, massage chairs, and an area for kids 3 and under. (My 2 year old brother was playing in the regular playground as well though) Lots of fun and really cheap! Strongly recommend.

Review: I do not usually post negative Reviews but this location made me feel very unsafe as a parent with more than one child I was watching!! We went to this location September4 24th 2022 was super busy that day.

I watched 2 of my children as they ran back & forth from the front of entrance. Plus breast feed my daughter so my hands were pretty full.

I almost had an heart attack when I could not see my son any more after noticing that the side door was open from people having an event the only thing that blocks from the event is a sign.

Which to me is totally unsafe any child could walk out from the side since the staff isn't doing a great job with making sure that side gate is shut. Plus where the bathrooms are at it takes you to the same hallways with out having a door or gate. There should be a gate anyway's where events are hosted since kids go back & forth to the play ground.

The play area is too big to have the ability to see the kids once they go up & play so I would not know where my son had exited

Thank goodness my son was just in the slide.

Whats the point of the gate in the front if a child or an adult that is not meant to be there can go through the side entrance of the parties or where the bathrooms are located.

But personally I would never ever come to this location ever again. Due to this reason I hope you guys take this into consideration & add a gate instead of just having a poster board blocking the entrance to the hallway.

The facilities and environment at Kangamoo created a fun and safe experience for my 2 year old who was constantly entertained by the variety of activities available to him. As a mom, I appreciated the clean, family-friendly restrooms, the pleasant staff, the complimentary beverages, and the healthy snacks for purchase. You can tell this place was designed by parents to meet the needs of families with little ones.  Wish we had a place like this in Hawaii! 100% recommend to anyone considering visiting.

At least we could go outside for a second to cool off since the weather was cool. Even just as a sitting spectator, I felt it was pretty warm inside. When asked if they could adjust the thermostat, I just got a ""No"" reply. I know AC costs $$, but please consider keeping the place a bit cooler so the kids don't overheat!

Review: The play structure is very unique, not your typical McDonald’s play place. For $10 a kid (adults free) it’s a great price. They didn’t inform me on a time limit, we stayed for 4 hours! There was so much to do. I was worried my 6 year old would be bored of the more “baby-type” things, but they had a small zip line, trampolines, it was all very interesting.

From what I saw, they were very careful checking hand stamps when leaving, so I felt safe enough to not have to panic every time I lost sight of her. Much better than say, Chuck E. Cheese.}","Nevada","kangamooplay.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","89119"

Review: This place has a good thought process behind its purpose as an alternative play and learning place for children.  As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.

Review: I used to live in Reno, and Wonder & Unwind was one of my absolute favorite places to go with my daughter when she was 3. She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.

The space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.

Even after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!

Unfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.
I won’t be returning to this place.

There are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.

They offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.

I’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.

I truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!

Review: Wonder and Unwind is such a delightful place to take your littles!  It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.

I wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.

Lastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.

Clean, safe, There’s a very big play area for a variety of ages, nice seating area for adults to relax or work. Snacks, coffees or tea are available for purchase at a very reasonable price. The staff is phenomenal!! I recommend this place to let the children get out and play!!

Review: We love Wonder & Unwind! It's a beautiful, clean, and safe space for my kids to play and learn. The staff is wonderful and they do their best to monitor, conflict resolve with the kids, and of course play with the kids. Sometimes I can even sneak in an hour or two of focused work time, something that is very hard to replicate at home.

Review: From the moment you walk in, you can tell how clean and well-maintained the entire space is. My little ones have an absolute blast exploring, and it’s clear that a lot of care has gone into making it a fun, engaging, and safe environment for them.

The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming, always making sure everyone is comfortable. They interact so well with the kids!

If you’re looking for a place where your kids can have a fantastic time while you get a chance to relax, Wonder and Unwind is a must-visit!

The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!

These kids took toys from one space to another even though they were told not to. They were very possessive and not willing to share the toys. 5 of these children left with one of the women who was working there.
I was not impressed.

Review: For starters, my kids had a BLAST. I had my son’s 1st birthday here. I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning

I feel like it's just the right size to play for about two hours.

Also, their facility is extremely clean, and so big and safe, it makes throwing birthdays and spending evenings or weekends here pretty magical for our kids😍😍

Review: We had our 3 year oldest birthday party at Kidstopia and we loved it. The place is very clean and has trampolines, swings, big wheels, slides, and other games for kids. There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!

Review: If I can do no stars I would! They need to do better with their appointment dates! I booked an open play a month ago! A month! For Thanksgiving day. Nowhere on the website or when booking the open play says they will be closed for the holiday. The holiday wasn't blacked out either. So I THOUGHT they were going to be open since not everywhere is closed. Or they could had send me an email saying they were closed on that day and to reschedule I would of done it!

Review: It was pretty cool except for the managers /person running the place on 10/29 in the morning son.
My 1 year old daugher went exploring into the bounce house and this 5 or 6 year old boy went inside it literally jumping on top of her stepping on her on purpose. We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.
My daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.

Otherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.

The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.

Review: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)

The party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here.

Review: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂

Review: We had the best experience having our daughter’s 4th birthday party here this past Saturday!! Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!

There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.

Came for a birthday party and workers actually seemed to enjoy their job and had fun with us. Even dressing up as the dragon and entertaining the party and birthday girl.
Thanks to Lee and team.

Bathrooms were clean and dry. I wish they had paper towels tho, instead of the Dyson hand dryer.
Stools were handy for kids to wash their hands … shockingly not a lot of kids places have that… surely helpful for the moms.

Review: Perfect place for kids anytime of the year but especially during a Vegas summer!!!
Staff are great with wiping down slides and making sure everyone is taken care of.
By far the best kids place in Vegas.
$20 all day. Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.
Today is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.
Plus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)
If you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…

The staff are super friendly especially Ivan. Love that the claw machine keeps working until the kids get a prize.

They keep everything very clean and make sure all the children are well behaved in a kind way. I highly recommend this place.

Review: Amazing place for a party, good visualization of the kid space.  very clean space, bring regular socks for everyone even if they are not climbing or playing, not grip socks.  Initially the sock part was odd to me but it makes a huge difference in how clean the space is which is nice.  Bright sunny fun environment, we will absolutely be back.

Review: We were going in for the 1st time to let our children play. It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.

I hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.

Review: Decided to give a new play place a try. Checking out with cashier and she sees my girls in grip socks and says we no longer allow grip socks. This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.

Review: Absolutely amazing experience at this children’s indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how incredibly clean and well-maintained. One worker JADE never stopped cleaning the entire facility. Star is the manager on duty. You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.

One of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.

We brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.

Highly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!

There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.

Came for a birthday party and workers actually seemed to enjoy their job and had fun with us. Even dressing up as the dragon and entertaining the party and birthday girl.
Thanks to Lee and team.

Bathrooms were clean and dry. I wish they had paper towels tho, instead of the Dyson hand dryer.
Stools were handy for kids to wash their hands … shockingly not a lot of kids places have that… surely helpful for the moms.

Staff are great with wiping down slides and making sure everyone is taken care of.
By far the best kids place in Vegas.
$20 all day. Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.
Today is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.
Plus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)
If you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…

Review: What a great place for the kids to come and run energy off while avoiding the heat!
The staff are super friendly especially Ivan. Love that the claw machine keeps working until the kids get a prize. Between the rides, climbing equipment, super fun dance party room and building blocks there isn’t a down minute. They keep everything very clean and make sure all the children are well behaved in a kind way. I highly recommend this place.

Review: Amazing place for a party, good visualization of the kid space.  very clean space, bring regular socks for everyone even if they are not climbing or playing, not grip socks.  Initially the sock part was odd to me but it makes a huge difference in how clean the space is which is nice.  Bright sunny fun environment, we will absolutely be back.

Review: We were going in for the 1st time to let our children play. It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.

I hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.

Review: Decided to give a new play place a try. Checking out with cashier and she sees my girls in grip socks and says we no longer allow grip socks. This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.

Review: Absolutely amazing experience at this children’s indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how incredibly clean and well-maintained. One worker JADE never stopped cleaning the entire facility. Star is the manager on duty. You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.

One of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.

We brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.

Highly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!

Review: First I have to say that the arcade play was ok. Right after that we went to the playground I took my 2 old daughter there the thing I didn't like was that my daughter got hit about 4 times there where kids there none of there parents where looking at them.  The other area where there suppose to be 3 years and younger there was older kids therethat was over 3 years old which these kids where rough. I thinks parents should looking at there kids at all times. There was some staff walking around and they didn't say anything about the older kids that where in the 3 and under section where the balls are at and slide. Im just saying to the family's that go there I found out that in the morning its better to take your toddler instead in the afternoon. In the morning they have a toddler only from a certain time. I think the staff should be more responsible what they see if thr company is enforcing the rules. Going back there again yes I would go but only in the morning.

Review: Wally Wombats is hands down one of the most delightful and family-friendly indoor playgrounds I’ve ever visited. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that feels like a breath of fresh air for parents and an absolute wonderland for kids. The space is immaculately clean, thoughtfully designed, and bursting with creative energy—it's clear the team behind Wally Wombats truly cares about making every visit a memorable experience.

The play structures are incredible—colorful, safe, and engaging for a wide range of ages. My kids could have stayed for hours exploring the climbing walls, tunnels, and slides, while the soft play areas are perfect for little ones who are just learning to crawl and walk. I especially appreciate the attention to safety: the staff keeps a watchful eye on the play zones, and everything from the flooring to the equipment feels high-quality and well-maintained.

What really sets Wally Wombats apart, though, is the heart behind it. The staff is exceptional—kind, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about creating a positive environment. They go above and beyond to ensure families feel welcome and supported, whether it’s helping with a birthday party setup or offering a friendly smile when you need a coffee break. Speaking of which, the café area is a fantastic touch! It’s a cozy space where parents can relax while the kids play, and the menu has plenty of options that make it easy to refuel without leaving the building.

Wally Wombats is also an incredible spot for hosting parties and special events. Their team takes care of the details so you can actually enjoy the day with your family, and they make every celebration feel special and unique.

Whether you're looking for a safe, engaging place for your kids to burn off energy or a welcoming community space for families to connect, Wally Wombats delivers in every way. It’s a gem in the community, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. If you’re in the area, do yourself and your family a favor—come experience the magic of Wally Wombats!

Review: Went for the first time on a Sunday at 10 AM, so glad we got there early because it wasn’t crowded yet. Everything looked clean and I saw a staff member regularly spraying down the equipment, which was nice. My 4 year old had so much fun running around!

Only downside was they didn’t let us use the bikes. The staff said it was too crowded but honestly, it didn’t feel that way. We didn’t try the food or drinks so can’t comment on that. Overall, a fun spot- we’ll probably be back!

Review: Always an amazing place and staff!!!

Update 05.13.2023
I am still a fan if this place wally wombats.

However, the previous 2 times wasn't such a great experience.
What happened to the great staff that was there??
The current  staff is a bit snippy and half do their job, too many people in the front making it difficult to get situated with kids and shoes.
I ordered fries that were full of grease and soggy and still white!!!! That upsets me because the guy knew that. Why aren't employees  taking pride in their work.
If they wouldn't eat it like that, why would they have someone else to do so.

Other than that it's ok..minor adjustments should be considered.

Also not being able to bring your food in is a game changer especially little snacks for babies.
But I can deal with that!!

Review: This place used to be so amazing. They stopped with therapy then turned it into an arcade. The staff here is rude at times. It seems like it lost the purpose of what wally wombat used to be. A place where kids were respected and valued and mostly cared for. This is just a dark dimmed playground now. My kids like the indoor playground because this is where they started their therapies. It became like a second home. Now the price to even play has gone up so much and also most of the staff just has an icky face towards childre. Like why even hire people like that. Another issue, it happens a lot ... when trying to get our bucket up front our profile 'doesn't show up"" so I have to go and re do the waiver again and again. It saddens me how this place was so amazing for kids is rotten bit by bit!

Review: First I have to say that the arcade play was ok. Right after that we went to the playground I took my 2 old daughter there the thing I didn't like was that my daughter got hit about 4 times there where kids there none of there parents where looking at them.  The other area where there suppose to be 3 years and younger there was older kids therethat was over 3 years old which these kids where rough. I thinks parents should looking at there kids at all times. There was some staff walking around and they didn't say anything about the older kids that where in the 3 and under section where the balls are at and slide. Im just saying to the family's that go there I found out that in the morning its better to take your toddler instead in the afternoon. In the morning they have a toddler only from a certain time. I think the staff should be more responsible what they see if thr company is enforcing the rules. Going back there again yes I would go but only in the morning.

From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that feels like a breath of fresh air for parents and an absolute wonderland for kids. The space is immaculately clean, thoughtfully designed, and bursting with creative energy—it's clear the team behind Wally Wombats truly cares about making every visit a memorable experience.

The play structures are incredible—colorful, safe, and engaging for a wide range of ages. My kids could have stayed for hours exploring the climbing walls, tunnels, and slides, while the soft play areas are perfect for little ones who are just learning to crawl and walk. I especially appreciate the attention to safety: the staff keeps a watchful eye on the play zones, and everything from the flooring to the equipment feels high-quality and well-maintained.

What really sets Wally Wombats apart, though, is the heart behind it. The staff is exceptional—kind, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about creating a positive environment. They go above and beyond to ensure families feel welcome and supported, whether it’s helping with a birthday party setup or offering a friendly smile when you need a coffee break. Speaking of which, the café area is a fantastic touch! It’s a cozy space where parents can relax while the kids play, and the menu has plenty of options that make it easy to refuel without leaving the building.

Wally Wombats is also an incredible spot for hosting parties and special events. Their team takes care of the details so you can actually enjoy the day with your family, and they make every celebration feel special and unique.

Whether you're looking for a safe, engaging place for your kids to burn off energy or a welcoming community space for families to connect, Wally Wombats delivers in every way. It’s a gem in the community, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. If you’re in the area, do yourself and your family a favor—come experience the magic of Wally Wombats!

Review: The place is actually fun for kids looking clean. The only problem is that the noise which K don’t know where is it coming from and it terrifies my boy ( May not affect other kids ). But the place is actually good for the kids.

Review: Went for the first time on a Sunday at 10 AM, so glad we got there early because it wasn’t crowded yet. Everything looked clean and I saw a staff member regularly spraying down the equipment, which was nice. My 4 year old had so much fun running around!

Only downside was they didn’t let us use the bikes. The staff said it was too crowded but honestly, it didn’t feel that way. We didn’t try the food or drinks so can’t comment on that. Overall, a fun spot- we’ll probably be back!

Review: Always an amazing place and staff!!!

Update 05.13.2023
I am still a fan if this place wally wombats.

However, the previous 2 times wasn't such a great experience.
What happened to the great staff that was there??
The current  staff is a bit snippy and half do their job, too many people in the front making it difficult to get situated with kids and shoes.
I ordered fries that were full of grease and soggy and still white!!!! That upsets me because the guy knew that. Why aren't employees  taking pride in their work.
If they wouldn't eat it like that, why would they have someone else to do so.

Other than that it's ok..minor adjustments should be considered.

Also not being able to bring your food in is a game changer especially little snacks for babies.
But I can deal with that!!

Review: This place used to be so amazing. They stopped with therapy then turned it into an arcade. The staff here is rude at times. It seems like it lost the purpose of what wally wombat used to be. A place where kids were respected and valued and mostly cared for. This is just a dark dimmed playground now. My kids like the indoor playground because this is where they started their therapies. It became like a second home. Now the price to even play has gone up so much and also most of the staff just has an icky face towards childre. Like why even hire people like that. Another issue, it happens a lot ... when trying to get our bucket up front our profile 'doesn't show up"" so I have to go and re do the waiver again and again. It saddens me how this place was so amazing for kids is rotten bit by bit!

Review: This place has a good thought process behind its purpose as an alternative play and learning place for children.  As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.

Review: I used to live in Reno, and Wonder & Unwind was one of my absolute favorite places to go with my daughter when she was 3. She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.

The space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.

Even after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!

Review: This is such a great concept for parents wanting to have their littles near while we can get work done, I can’t wait to see Wonder & Unwind grow and even possibly into a bigger space (or maybe expand on the “parents” section) because if one is working or reading, the kids can still be pretty loud or present. But again, great concept and very clean space. We enjoyed our time here. :)

Review: Overall, the staff is kind and professional, which I appreciate.
Unfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.
I won’t be returning to this place.

Review: I LOVE THIS PLACE!!
There are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.

They offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.

I’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.

I truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!

Review: Wonder and Unwind is such a delightful place to take your littles!  It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.

I wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.

Lastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.

Review: We love Wonder and unwind! It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!

Review: I took my 2-year old granddaughter to play on a Monday morning. There were older kids running through out the space, even in the smaller spaces designated as quiet areas. These kids took toys from one space to another even though they were told not to. They were very possessive and not willing to share the toys. 5 of these children left with one of the women who was working there.
I was not impressed.

Review: For starters, my kids had a BLAST. I had my son’s 1st birthday here. I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning

It is easy for small children to keep an eye on and play with it.
The staff is always there and the doors are locked, so you don't have to worry about people escaping, and the risk level is low, which is good.
I feel like it's just the right size to play for about two hours.

There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!

Review: It was pretty cool except for the managers /person running the place on 10/29 in the morning son.
My 1 year old daugher went exploring into the bounce house and this 5 or 6 year old boy went inside it literally jumping on top of her stepping on her on purpose. We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.
My daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.

Otherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.

Review: Not very impressed. Positives: nice staff, clean bathrooms, not too busy. Negatives: you have to pay extra to use the arcade games and many of them didn't even work or were missing buttons. The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.

Review: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)

Review: Recently had my son’s 3rd birthday party here and it was such a great time! We did the semi-private weekend party package and had about 50 people in our party alone but it was nice to also share the venue with the public. The party room is huge and has a private bathroom for your guests.
The party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here. Not to mention Lucas (owner) and his staff are very friendly and easy to work with

Review: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂

Review: We had the best experience having our daughter’s 4th birthday party here this past Saturday!! Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!

Review: For starters, my kids had a BLAST. I had my son’s 1st birthday here. I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning

I feel like it's just the right size to play for about two hours.

There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!

Review: If I can do no stars I would! They need to do better with their appointment dates! I booked an open play a month ago! A month! For Thanksgiving day. Nowhere on the website or when booking the open play says they will be closed for the holiday. The holiday wasn't blacked out either. So I THOUGHT they were going to be open since not everywhere is closed. Or they could had send me an email saying they were closed on that day and to reschedule I would of done it!

Review: It was pretty cool except for the managers /person running the place on 10/29 in the morning son.
My 1 year old daugher went exploring into the bounce house and this 5 or 6 year old boy went inside it literally jumping on top of her stepping on her on purpose. We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.
My daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.

Otherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.

Review: This place is clean and organized. The owner is very nice and friendly. Lots of seating for adults. The playroom and the area is very nice especially for toddlers to run around! Playroom is quite roomy with lots of things for the kids to play! My kid really enjoyed his time here and even ran over to hug me that's how excited this place is, so 5 stars. It wasn't crowded on a Tuesday morning 🌅

The kids had an amazing time! The room was spacious, standard decoration included.
If I didn’t rate a 5 star it’s because I wish there would have been a party host to help out serving guest or organizing the timing.
Other then that it was great!

Review: Not very impressed. Positives: nice staff, clean bathrooms, not too busy. Negatives: you have to pay extra to use the arcade games and many of them didn't even work or were missing buttons. The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.

Review: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)

Review: Recently had my son’s 3rd birthday party here and it was such a great time! We did the semi-private weekend party package and had about 50 people in our party alone but it was nice to also share the venue with the public. The party room is huge and has a private bathroom for your guests.
The party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here. Not to mention Lucas (owner) and his staff are very friendly and easy to work with

Review: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂

Review: We had the best experience having our daughter’s 4th birthday party here this past Saturday!! Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!

There was even ample room to have Pose Party Post set up a braid bar for the girls. The kids had so much fun and could not get enough of the claw machine there. The parents that came were able sit back and relax knowing their kids were in sight and safe.
They set up the party room too which is such a huge help! Overall, just a nice establishment to be able to support.

Party room is big and spacious and beautifully decorated and again spotless. I am really impressed with Kidstopja and highly recommend it to children of all ages.
