The decals/decorations on several of the structures was torn and then still filthy. The rope bridge in the toddler are did not look safe for actual toddlers, designed for kids at least 4 or 5. The alarm on the door went off, a worker came several minutes later to turn it off and announced quietly as she walked out “let’s keep the toddler area to under 3” but did nothing to get the 7-8 year old kids playing there to leave. There were a LOT of big kids playing in the toddler area, and not watching out for the little ones who belonged in the area.

I was planning to take my grandson here. (13 years old) Having no clue it was really mostly for little kids. We still bought a ticket (12 dollars) and wasn't worth it even if the the tickets were free. It was so easy for little kids to sneak in. The only staff were the ones selling the tickets, wow ""great"" safety! And as soon as we get in we see so many little kids running around and being reckless while their parents are talking away doing nothing. So packed to even find a spot to sit down. We see so many snotty nose kids picking away and the whole place smelled like pee and poop like a McDonald's play place.

I would have given it more stars but the 3 and under isn't safe for the little kids. Older kids go in the area to play. I can't tell you how many times my 1 yr old almost got trampled. There is no one to monitor what ages go in and the parents don't care either⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mee Yang⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: It is one of the best local indoor playgrounds so far. My 2-year old twins love it. They have a gated section for 0-3 yr old to play around and an opened section for big kids. Their are a bunch of crawl spaces, tunnels, and slides to slide down, climb, and move around in. I'm definitely going back, and we will be regular. I believe that during the weekdays, the cost per child is $5.50 toward the end of the day, and the weekend is $8 (supervising adult is free). There are signs that everybody must wear socks for hygiene, safety, and to protect the playground, but because the staff does not monitor carefully, there are some parents who disregard the signs and have a lack of respect and courtesy for the facility guidelines, so you will see them wearing shoes.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mohammed Rahman⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: $8 for my 2.5 year old’s entry and $4 for his socks. The toddler area is not manned at all times so there was an influx of older kids coming in. This raised our concerns for our toddler’s safety so we left early. I hope they implement the “toddler-only” policy in the toddler area strictly. The front desk staffer was understanding and took our feedback well. Thanks.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nate J⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: The park is great! Tons of fun things to do for kids of all ages groups. I can't give it 5 stars because they allow the ""Hover Parents"" to follow their kids thru the tunnels. So while my kid is running around 20 feet in the air, he encounters a 200lb man completely blocking the way... Then he comes back saying, ""There was a big guy, he was scary!"" Seriously, people, let your kids explore on their own. They don't need you on top of them!

You can see an inch of dust under the equipment (especially under the slides on the right side), and the dust bunnies are floating around the room. I felt like my eyes were itchy and we didn't stay long because of it.⏎ ⏎ As others pointed out in their reviews, this place STINKS and they need to figure out why. Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.⏎ ⏎ More ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.⏎ ⏎ I'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashlei Kraemer⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Not enough seating but kids of all ages loved it!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jake Kvanbeck⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jamall Dyar⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: My kids love this indoor playground as it definitely provides hours of fun.

I brought my son two times in a one week and I noticed a few things I was not pleased with.  First is the price, ridiculous for one time, monthly whatever way you want to pay is not great.  They make you buy their socks the first time even if you have socks with grip… second is the cleanliness and the types of toys.  Dust and dirt everywhere.   Clearly a lack of cleaning overall.  Plastics pieces and foam were everywhere (choking hazard). Vacuuming and moping/spraying needs to happen everyday, everywhere.  The young teenage employees should be walking around and wiping stuff down not just sitting on their phones. Some of toys are dangerous for small children especially in the “doctors” area.  Flimsy plastic that could break and or too small for choking.  And yes, every kid puts stuff in their mouth even when you say no.  The desk in the “grocery store” is dangerous for fingers and sharp corners.⏎ Lastly, it’s absolutely freezing.

His favorite the ball sucker wall thing was his ultimate favorite. There were alot of signs that stuff was broken or not allowed to use. Average play places charge for the same cost with socks. I just found the membership outrageous. There are other places that have 10 passes for less than $100. They wanted almost $400 a month or almost $700 a year. You would have to make sure to attend every day to get your money's worth. The kids birthday party area is not ideal. It is very small. Would just recommend to come once in a while.

Spent $19.99 for one 2 yr old & 2 pair of socks. Adults are NOT FREE must buy socks to be in play area.⏎ Here are some tips. ........⏎ Snack & beverage bar available for additional cost. Ideal ages children (2-7). FILL THE WAIVER OUT BEFORE YOU ENTER the building. The seating/reception/party room area is not a large area. Seating options are backless stools or a few tables with chairs. Be prepared to carry around valuables or leave them out in the open. No coat hangers so if you can leave coats in the vehicle I would. Before planning to have a party, I would visit the location to see the space. Parking lot is shared with 2 other business but seemed to be enough. Temperature was warm so wear layers. Only two chairs for adult seating in play area, not many options.⏎ Hope this helps!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Howard Edlund⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: Edited a year ago⏎ Review: A nice little place to get out of the house and wear the kids out for a little bit.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashley Hartfiel⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: Edited a year ago⏎ Review: Nice, clean new place… but expensive and RUDE employee.

No place to sit or stand. Most adults stayed outside. The establishment  would not let us use the bathroom unless you pay $2.50 for the socks to walk to the back Where the bathrooms were.   We had greatgrand parents in ther 80s who could not put the socks on so had to walk to the coffee shop. A father had his young daughter come to him who needed the bathroom but he was told he couldn't go back without purchasing the socks. You can't supervise you children unless you  purchase the socks.  I myself purchased the socks and was with the kids.  I multiple times witnessed the counter girl going to the back and snapping at the children for only one on the trampoline at a time, but you had to go across the trampoline to get to the foam pit. There is a big cone by the merry-go-round (Which never stops) with a hollow center that when the child goes head first into is totally unable to get out of and is now stuck in on there head. Had it been a smaller child they would have gone straight down on their head.  The toys in the clinic were brocken so when the kids put the audoscope to there face they could get cut. And i hope thet sanitizing the stuffed animal.  Also be prepared to bag and empty your trash can before you go. For a birthday party I give 0 stars. If you go with just your children it could be a 2 star.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Stephanie Jorgensen⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Very disappointed with this place.

I do think the cost for one day is a bit on the higher side when compared to other comparable play places in the Twin Cities; however, The admission ticket gets you all day, which is a big difference from most places that limit your admission to two hours. When looking at the pricing online, it would seem that the monthly membership is well worth the cost. There is also no admission fee for the adults, which is quite nice in comparison to some of the other places!⏎ ⏎ The play structures are very clean and well maintained. I loved how much seating there was for the adults. You could tell that a lot of thought was put into this place to provide comfort and convenience in all aspects. I really liked that compared to other play places there were less small toys. I find in some of the other places, the small toys create a huge tripping mass very quickly. I thought the emphasis on play structures was super nice, it almost seemed like an OT built the place. My kids had a wonderful time and have been asking daily to go back!

I had high hopes for this place, but it was a complete letdown. It’s overpriced and even worse, the customer service is just awful. The owner Heather is shockingly unprofessional and clearly doesn’t understand how to run a business. After I professionally requested a refund (for a 2nd time) instead of a credit via email after a misunderstanding she said I was rude and ‘never allowed back’? It was so strange. Not like I wanted to go back anyway after the struggle it was to be refunded, but it’s clear they care more about taking people’s money than providing a quality experience and doing the right thing without getting defensive.⏎ There are far better places that actually value their customers.

Great space to let the littles (I'd say age 5 is pushing it) play while parents chat. There are little nuances to the space that could be fixed up/changed to get 5 stars. The imaginarium train table tracks have been glued down to the table totally defeating the purpose of imaginary and creative play. Some pieces have been ripped off, making some unusable as well as ripping up the table. The hand dryer in the restroom does not work, i had to scurry around and check out the changing station where I was lucky to find paper towels.

For 15 bucks per child, I had mediocre expectations, which were absolutely not met. The entire place was absolutely disgusting and filthy. I took my daughter to the bathroom, and before we could see that the toilet had overflowed, my daughter walked into the toilet water on the floor. Luckily, I had a spare pair of socks  but we had to throw the ones we came in with away. When we sought out another bathroom to get cleaned up, it was out of the basics, no soap and dirty. Just to have one person on staff to do these basic tasks would be the minimum expectation for a place of this size. You can tell there is little pride in the space and the people have given up on maintenance and are just there to take your money.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Brittany Misuraca⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: We came for a birthday party.

You enter a code to come in, but no one was there monitoring the entrance and people were letting others in. No one was monitoring the play area or facilities either. We were there for 3 hours and I never saw an employee. I was in three different bathrooms with my kids and two were out of toilet paper and paper towels.

Another reviewer mentioned the coffee beans spilled under the big chess pieces four months ago.  The coffee beans are still there under the mats.

This place needs to be shut down for a month to patch and paint the drywall, do a serious deep clean, and make sure everything in here is in safe working order.

Our infant had fun crawling around on the green turf but there was a lot of small garbage on the ground from confetti pieces to bottle caps. I picked up and threw away what I saw. I'm not sure how often they clean the facility but it was dirty. Could use drywall patching and paint. There are things written on the walls along with big holes. There are cameras around the building so if there isn't anyone here maintaining it, then they should watch every once in awhile to see who's damaging things or misusing items... which is unfortunate when parents should be responsible. Some parents and their kids went barefooted as well, which is gross and not hygienic. They didn't seem to care about the rules when told. That's also a health hazard. The hand painted graphics are fun.  There's a little game area. A lot of tables to sit at. Not bad for an indoor play area but dirty with lazy upkeep and enforcement.

They always have a blast, but this time was the first time I’ve seriously considered not returning given the cleanliness and safety concerns. There were some holes in the drywall exposing wiring that young children could easily pull out. These were in high traffic and highly visible areas. In addition, the play areas seemed extremely dirty. The floors in the age 2 to 5 playground area were especially gross. Dust, food remnants and who knows what were visibly evident. We were there about two hours, and I observed one person cleaning the tables and eating areas, but the play areas seem totally neglected and not kept up. Part of this is on the part of parents of especially older children who tend to run wild and misuse equipment. Nevertheless, I don’t think we’ll be back, which is a shame, considering we’ve enjoyed this facility a number of times over the past decade.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

The two-year-and-under area did not have many options. The battery-powered toys were dead.⏎ ⏎ Luckily, it was a big place and there were tons of things to do. The only issue I had was that not all parents supervised their children. They let their older children run around unsupervised. We were on the trampoline at one end with other little ones. There was a preteen boy whom I had seen earlier playing with his mother and three other siblings. He ran right up to my daughter and jumped, landing as heavily as he could two inches away from my toddler. If he had missed and landed on her, he would have hurt her. We had to take her off the trampoline. His mother was nowhere near him. I saw her in a different area with her other three children.⏎ ⏎ Parents, if you cannot manage your children, or if your children are not well-behaved, do not bring them at all.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Daniel Hoffman Jr⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Fun place to take the kids when the weather is gross!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chris Palm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Inner Active Playground in Plymouth, Minnesota is absolutely awesome!

So we moved some chairs to sat together as a group, the worker came up to us screaming to put the chairs back that we are not allowed to move them. It was so bad for me in front of my guests. So I emailed the owner right away, but I didn’t get any response back. So clearly they do not care. So DO NOT west your money here. Go Urban Air, best customer service and you get what you pay for.

When you walk through the first set of doors you cannot advance further. Would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time online. Because trying to buy them on arrival is super frustrating. You are stuck between the two doors that are still the entryway, and so you have to stand there and order tickets while your kids are waiting to get in and other people are trying to get in past you. I tried 2 different cards online and it didn't work (which my cards worked fine before and after this place and have plenty of money)  So my friend had to use hers, and it worked. I look at my account and they charge my account four times and then charged it an additional four times for a dollar fee. It charged me four times and we never got any code.So my cards were working, but the website was weird. Then I see there's multiple refunds on my account while we are there. Then I all of a sudden, get 2 emails with codes 30 minutes later. What's someone else's name on it? Which doesn't make sense since I used my phone?So how was there someone else's name on my code. I went to run outside to grab a water and had my daughter stand by the door to let me back in. Since I didn't have the code and it was on my friend's phone. However, they have it so that you cannot open the door from the inside, no handles, which is a safety hazzard. And my daughter couldn't open the door to let me back in. My daughter had to run through and find my friend to give me the code. My friend even walked over to open the door but they have no handles on the inside to open the door for me. So I had to wait for her to find the code on her phone again for me to enter it. What she had to hold up to the glass so I could see to enter the code to enter in again even though we were already inside and had already paid. It doesn't appear that there's any staff there at all to help you. Kind of makes me worry that there's nobody there if there were problems. To add to that, I would say, the price is pretty high for what's there. The pictures online look much cooler than the place actually is and the pictures online are kind of deceiving. The cost to get in there is the same cost as urban air and urban area is much better quality. I would say the place is just okay, but honestly I think the admission should be about anywhere from $5 to $8. They have some cool features, but it really is just an indoor play set. I have been to other indoor playgrounds that charge a lot less. The signs everywhere are a little intense. At one point another boy hurt my daughter and her finger looked broken, I don't think it is but very swollen but there are no staff to ensure safety and that kids are not being too aggressive. Just so many odd signs, one of them being that it's a crime to enter without paying, which duh...  you should pay. But then even more signs in the two year old area that if you are able to read the sign that you're too old to be in this area. Which also a duh. But if there were some staff there to ensure rules were being followed, there wouldn't need to be so many signs. I don't know. Just overall, experience wasn't very good especially  trying to get in and the handle less door was not the greatest, priced too high, buying tickets in-between the outside doors with the cold was a little ridiculous. I don't normally leave reviews, but wanted to leave this because if I would have seen a review like this.I probably would have tried to go somewhere else.⏎ ⏎ To also add i tried calling my friend's phone and she didn't see my call and may daughter almost couldn't hear me through the glass door so I can to shout for her to hear me. If my daughter hadn't not been by the door and my friend never saw her phone I would have been locked outside for a long time. Which is also worrisome.⏎ ⏎ My 7YO and 6YO were bored in the first few minutes of being here i had to convince them to stay and try and make friends since we spent so much money to get in.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kathy Stroth⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Kathy, thank you so much for the five star review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Amy Rogers⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Super way to let kids go crazy!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kevin Dahm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Pretty cool.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

I noticed that some children were playing unsupervised, creating unsafe situations. For example, I witnessed a six-month-old child almost getting hurt in the designated baby area due to older children using equipment incorrectly and without appropriate supervision.⏎ ⏎ I appreciate your previous response to my concerns, but it seems that the essential rules aimed at ensuring the safety of all children are not being adequately enforced. It is particularly troubling that enforcement appears to focus primarily on monetary transactions rather than the essential safety regulations that protect our kids.⏎ ⏎ As a concerned patron, I urge you to take immediate action to address these issues. If these safety concerns are not addressed properly, I feel compelled to share my experiences on social media and spread the word about the lack of safety at Good Times Park.⏎ ⏎ Maintaining a safe environment for children should be the highest priority, and I sincerely hope to see improvements that would encourage me to return as a customer in the future.⏎ ⏎ Thank you for your attention to this matter.

It is a place full of colorful swings, slides, and the occasional sound of music playing from a distant vendor’s cart. For most, it is a space of happiness. However, for me, my experience with the Good Times Park has been different. It is a place where I often feel alone, reminded of the harsh realities of my life as an orphan, and of the mean lady who often makes my visits there even more difficult.⏎ ⏎ Being an orphan is not something I ever imagined would define my life. I lost my parents when I was very young, and since then, I have been in and out of foster homes. I never really had a place to call my own. The Good Times Park, with its bright colors and cheerful faces, was one of the few places I hoped to find a sense of belonging. I would often walk through the park, watching the other children with their parents, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of longing deep inside. I wondered what it would be like to have a family that would take me to the park, to share a moment of joy with me.⏎ ⏎ Yet, there is one person who has made it difficult for me to enjoy the park: the lady who is often there. She is an older woman, and her presence seems to cast a shadow over the park’s otherwise sunny atmosphere. She is the park’s caretaker, or at least, that’s what I have gathered. Every time I visit, she seems to be watching me with disdain. She never smiles or greets me like she does with the other children. If I get too close to the swings or the slides, she often scolds me, telling me that I shouldn’t be playing because I don’t belong there. Her words sting, and it is as if the park, a place that should be filled with joy, becomes a reminder of my loneliness.⏎ ⏎ The harshness of her attitude is even more difficult to bear because of the absence of my own family. When I see children laughing and playing with their parents, it reminds me of what I don’t have. I can feel the emptiness, and the lady’s unkindness only deepens that feeling. Her presence feels like an additional weight on my shoulders, as though I am being constantly reminded of my lack of a family and the cruelty that exists in the world.⏎ ⏎ I sometimes wonder why she acts this way toward me. Perhaps it is because I am an orphan, a child without a place to call home, and she sees me as different. But the truth is, her behavior only adds to my sense of isolation. I wish that people like her would understand the pain of being without a family and the importance of kindness. The Good Times Park, which should be a place of joy and healing, often feels like an unwelcoming reminder of my struggles.⏎ ⏎ Despite her mean demeanor, I try to find moments of peace in the park. I sit on the benches, watching the other children play. I try to lose myself in their laughter and the sense of normalcy that surrounds them, but it is never quite the same. My heart aches as I realize that my life will never be like theirs. I have no one to share these moments with, and the cruel lady’s behavior only reinforces that loneliness.⏎ ⏎ However, I still hold on to the hope that someday things will change. Maybe the lady will be kinder, maybe I will find a family, or maybe I will learn to see the park differently. For now, I continue to visit the Good Times Park, though the experiences are bittersweet. The pain of being an orphan and the meanness of the lady linger in my heart, but I still try to find a glimmer of hope and joy in the moments when I can.⏎ ⏎ In conclusion, the Good Times Park is a place filled with contrasts for me. It is a space that should represent happiness and connection, but for me, it often feels like a symbol of my loneliness and pain. The lady, whose coldness hurts more than I can explain, is just one part of the challenge. As an orphan, I long for the simple pleasures that others seem to take for granted. While the park may never be the sanctuary⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Owen Forbes⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Ts was a horrible experience me and my friends were trying to have a good time and they stopped us just because we couldn't have a adult..im a orphan.

Unfortunately my visit on December 24th was less than enjoyable.⏎ Owners/Managers need to be a little more hands-on when other guests have zero common sense. A group came in at 9:10am. Three 20 - 30 something men proceeded to run picks with a football in the soccer area. Then they went to the basketball area and the three played basketball for over an hour. It was so dangerous for the little ones that all of the parents and kids had to clear out for their safety. If that wasn't enough,  these three knuckle heads went to the bounce area for several minutes.⏎ Since people have no regard for others,  Good Times needs to step in.⏎ These guys didn't pay to get in because they were with a group and felt they owned the place.⏎ Very frustrating that my 8, 6 and 2 year old couldn't enjoy their day off.⏎ I would have stepped in but these burly dudes were very intimidating and obviously didn't care about others.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Navin D⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: Edited 6 months ago⏎ Review: Not suitable for toddlers. My daughter who is 3 years old felt terrified with bigger kids running around at high speed without noticing who is around. No play area segregation based on the age. There is small area for kids below two years of age but rest of the area is common for all kids until 17 years. Just got my membership and cancelled it right away. Don’t want my kid to be traumatized. Good park employee just sits inside the room and watches the phone and doesn’t care what is happening in the play area. Atleast if the employee can let the bigger kids know not to run and watch out for others that would be great.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Todd Neuman⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lance Davis⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: Kids loved it⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jude Kruse⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: It's got veritable places to a block corner, a children's corner with bump free mats and some small children playground equipment too, they also have a bounce pillow that we do go on but I would say to only go right before they close to go on it if you have small infants.

It does get scary sometimes, with some of the older kids kicking the balls too hard, but that’s why you must watch your child the entire time. Some kids play rougher, but that’s kids, and their parents should be monitoring how their kids are interacting with others, too.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kristopher Kopp⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Great spot to let the kids run!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Boushra Ghazal⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: Edited a year ago⏎ Review: I had a negative review earlier.

My baby learned how to climb & go down slides & my toddlers found a new love for swinging/spinning (egg swing is what we called it).⏎ ⏎ If you're looking for a safe space for your kiddos to play where parents are tentative to their children, this is it. We didn't have to worry about any unsupervised kids. Door is heavy enough to where if a kiddo did run off, they wouldn't be able to exit. & the place isn't big to where you feel overwhelmed. You can see your child from any location in the room.⏎ ⏎ The place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well, no odors or messes. Bonus points for the rubber flooring that makes falls easier to handle. & the couches placed throughout so parents have somewhere to sit. Offially our favorite local indoor place for the littles.

I'd recommend this for ages 3 and under. It's designed for parents who also have an infant to care for, as there a whole corner just for tinies that includes a rocking/nursing chair!! There's a little area for crawlers so that they don't get trampled. There are FOUR big, comfy couches around for the adults, flooring is totally padded except for the kitchen area. THEY STOCK THE BATHROOMS WITH DIAPERS AND WIPES. That's unheard of. Decent vending machine, sink, coffee machine, drinking fountains, cubbies for shoes and coats. $14 for one kid, good for the whole day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Кайрат Бейсенбаев⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: The best place I've been!!!!👍👍👍 …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lisa Miller⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: ak⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Amazing soft play playground for toddlers!

Nice atmosphere for moms also; you can choose to socialize or to do your own thing. You are able to bring in food or buy their snacks and drinks which can be convenient. There were only two tables so when both were occupied with other parents working/reading, or storing their food and stuff, we unfortunately resorted to sitting on the floor to eat until a table opened up.

Lots of dangerous things such as the back door could very easily be opened, no bumpers on doors for finger protection, the metal grates in the doors are sharp and fingers could get stuck in them. We found toys with small pieces that young ones could choke on. The thing that I noticed was how toxic everything is.

He had a ton of fun climbing through each area up and down.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Katelyn L⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: $14 for a child to go in.

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).  We would go back anytime, but on a day when it was 95 degrees outside and you have a little one that wants to go to a playground, this place was a life saver.  We loved it!!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Andrew LeTourneau⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a week ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review Andrew⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Little Guardian⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 weeks ago⏎ Review: Great place⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Taylor Musgjerd⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 weeks ago⏎ Review: A bit spendy regardless of day pass or membership but still a great place to go once in a while!

And bought a membership for me despite them knowing I had a membership she bought it the second membership. And it was a huge hassle totryy to fix it.⏎ The no food policy is RIDICULOUS. it's all because they got mad that some family had a bday party in their picnic area. Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of ""only snacks"" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks? Idk The policy is ridiculous. And doesn't make much sense to anyone lol.⏎ ⏎ That being said it's still fun but I wish they'd re-evaluate the rule.

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Riggott⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review, Jacob!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Larson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: An amazing play place!

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

My kids' favorite part of the playground was what they dubbed the ""carwash"" which was kind of like a ninja maze (pictured). There is a nice indoor waterfall area outside of the playground that my kids enjoyed as well.⏎ ⏎ Downsides: no food at the tables, though drinks are permitted. If your kid is timid and wants you to go through with them the first few times some of the crawl spaces are extremely tight for the grown-ups - wear your workout pants! A lot of the crawl spaces are very dark, which my kids didn't prefer. The bigger slides are super fast compared to most playgrounds we frequent (indoor or outdoor) so the kids only went down the big ones twice. We still managed to be there for almost three hours, so obviously it's not terrible.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Renee Biggerstaff⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Michaela McKee⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Emily Bravo⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: My kiddos always have fun here.

My little had lots of fun running around it! It IS hard to keep track of where your child is in here, as most of the structures are low visibility. Everything is roped/gated off to try to prevent any leaving, but the desk where you check in was not paying attention to much more than their phone.⏎ The issues I had: parents were NOT watching their children and no one was enforcing the rules (no running, screaming, rough housing). Many times older kids would come chasing each other, literally screaming, and it scared some of the younger children and made it hard to enjoy. Most parents were sitting to the side on their phone or computer. I wish there was more enforcement and accountability on staff and parents end of things to make the park enjoyable for all visiting. I wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone under 3 (most were school age kids there running).⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christina Marchand⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 years ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Carlos Lobos⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 3 years ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jeanne B.

Perfect for a snow day, no school, or to get your kids off the tablets and exercise! They have lockers and cubbies for you to use. You can bring snacks and beverages as long as it's at the tables. The best part about this playground is that it's inside the Woodbury library and has a nature center area. I've never been to a place that has so many things to offer at 1 location! Also, you have to check out the waterfalls inside! They're are beautiful and peaceful.. This is a wonderful place to have  lunch, business meetings, remote working, or just a peaceful place to read. The best part about the park is that parents are free and the kids are 5.50 per child. We took 7 kids with 3 adults, and it was a wonderful time! We definitely will be back soon!

Bought 2 milks & a soda, paid with my credit card.  Went back later to buy a bottle of water.  Cost ($2) and paid with cash.  The girl (taller, short hair blond) is not the friendliest; she barely wanted to take my money.  Stuck out her hands and took the bills with two fingers as if they were contaminated.  She left them on the countertop even after I had left.  This is my first time here with my boys because we live close by, and will probably be my last.  This experience leaves a bad taste.  I do not recommend this place if this is the customer service offered.  Clearly there are signs that say no food or drinks but the front desk staff is eating a cold sandwich.  Other patrons who came later brought in outside food as well.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Guillermo Dorado⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 years ago⏎ Review: What a wonderful and safe place for my 3 yrs old to burn off some energy}","{}"

I would say it best for kids 12 and under. My 12 year old had a blast running around with her younger sisters (6 and 8), but I’m not sure much older kids would have as much fun. The price is for all day and you can come and go as you please for that one admission fee. There are a few arcade machines and fun ride ons available for credits called “flames”. We bought 50 flames for $10, which my kids mostly used for the ride ons. It’s only 5 flames per ride. I don’t think the arcade machines are worth it, but they’re there if your kid really wants a little prize.

The birthday party meal package that we went with included pizza, cake, beverages, decorations, credits for games/rides, and goody bags. You're able to bring in outside food with the party so we brought a few snacks and sparkling waters for the adults. We (and our guests) were so impressed with the cleanliness and quality of the facility. The play structure is completely enclosed (so no intrepid explorers can make their way out of the play area) and can fully accommodate adults so the parents can get in to help kids when needed (or just to join in the fun). There is another play structure for smaller kids (toddlers in diapers and under) so there was something fun for all ages.⏎ ⏎ We chose a 10:30am slot on a Saturday and it was great for our ages 2-5. It wasn't too busy (started getting pretty packed by the time we left at 2:30pm) and the majority of kids in the structure were around that age. I felt safe letting my 3 and 5 year olds run free with less supervision.⏎ ⏎ The thing that really stood out was the professionalism and attention to detail of the events team that handled our party! They took care of everything and made sure we were having a great time. I highly recommend this place for birthday parties and we'll definitely be back on another day just to have hours of fun climbing, running, and playing in this awesome place!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nat⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Staff is lovely!

It was the first day of Spring Break and EID. Management needs to plan better staffing-wise around school breaks and holidays.⏎ ⏎ A little while into our visit, the male staff found two young kids but could not find their adult. He carried them both around, trying to find their adult. There has to be a better way for staff to locate parents than this. With how chaotic it was, he could have easily tripped while carrying both of these kids and they all would have gotten hurt. Mom was eventually found, and all seemed well.⏎ ⏎ A little boy hurt himself pretty badly (gash on his head, absolutely needed stitches). Thankfully, I had napkins at my table and was able to apply pressure while my husband told the staff to get the first aid kit, and the child's parents were found. About 30 minutes after the family had left, there was still blood on the floor next to my table. I walked to the counter (noticed a bloody gauze pad on the floor on the way) to let the female employee know about the blood on the floor and the gauze pad, and her response was less than desired. She cut me off before I could even tell her where the blood was by saying 'We are working on it."" I tried to tell her that I understood they were working on it but I wanted to let her know the location, and she cut me off AGAIN with, 'We know, we are working on it.' (I never was able to tell her about the bloody gauze pad or the location of blood by my table)⏎ ⏎ About 15 minutes later, the male staff member was walking around the sitting area with paper towels and a bottle of cleaner, not wearing gloves. I am not sure if he was looking for blood spots or was just doing some regular cleaning.⏎ ⏎ We left at 7:30, and the blood was still on the floor near my table.⏎ ⏎ We have been to this location before and had a great time. It was clean and the staff were friendly. Last night, they needed a minimum of two more staff members working for them to be successful.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: mathew little⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Fun time with my 3 year old.

My 2 year old son slipped, even with grippy socks,  and hit his head very hard and threw up shortly afterwards. My sister went to get an icepack and the staff gave us one that was supposed to become cold after cracking it, but the icepack never got cold. Then we found out the staff called an ambulance without seeing what happened or talking to us first. When we asked for help directly they chastised us for not having left already. Absurd and incredibly unprofessional behavior. It was all very strange and an avoidable situation. There was only one person working at the front when we came and the play area was completely unsupervised. I also agree with all the other comments. Overpriced, system was strange, was not very clean, and UNSAFE. We did take our son to the hospital and thankfully he was fine.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jesi Sola Konz⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: I would give this place zero stars if I could, the worst thing is the insecurity and danger, they have a room with dim lights and the floor is very slippery, my son slipped and hit his head. The staff didn't ask us parents anything, a few minutes later my son vomited, we think it was because of the blow, the staff came to say they didn't want to be rude but what were we doing? I was changing diapers and getting my son ready to go to the emergency room. Without asking us, she called an ambulance, we wanted to buy socks because my son soiled his with vomit, the socks they sell are not safe and have no grip, how is that possible in a place that specializes in children? That alone I recommend not going, but it is also very expensive for what they offer, you cannot bring drinks or food and you can only consume what they sell. We will never go back to a place like this.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ubeyti Jara⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Very amazing.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: U2llIGlzdA RGVyIEhhdXB0YmF1ZXIK⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Cute and simple.

We went this past Friday and the place is still very clean, temperature controlled, bright and well cared for.  The one employee who was working the front noticed my nephew was crying and came over to see if he was okay because he had accidentally got kicked in the eye while on the ""spider web"" tower and asked if he wanted a sucker and an ice pack.  Only thing I wish they did have is wipes in the changing table to use to wipe the changing table.  The concessions stand is reasonable and the arcade card you can get is great ($20 for 100 points).  The kiddos love the bikes they can self drive.  I'm so grateful that this place opened in our neighborhood and is open throughout the year especially during the winter.

The management of the people at the park is non-existent. Multiple times that we have been to this park, the equipment has been taken over by people looking 18+ years old. The equipment is designed for younger kids up to middle school, so people adult‐size make the park cramped and unsafe for children to play. The employees ignore any of this going on and let everything be free roam. Our younger child was almost crushed under a 6'2 probably 200+ pound person that jumped down the strap climbing area without looking at the 4-6 year olds climbing from the bottom. The soccer area which is about 20 feet by 30 feet in size was taken over by about 15+ of these adults that were wrestling and pushing each other and small children out of the way. There should be restrictions enforced for safety in a play area of this size, but there aren't any. This crowd shows up regularly as well as they have been there almost every time I've visited. My kids love the park but it feels too unsafe to bring them again after the incidents in our last visit.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Devan King⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Dianne Andrews⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Faith Sanders⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: My daughter absolutely loved this place.

And the guilt associated when you are finding this out when you are standing there with your child or your grandchildren and you have to tell them because of how incredibly expensive it is that you will not be able to play there is incredible! - it almost seems like that guilt is counted on as it is really tough to tell your kids or grandkids that we have to go because you did not budget for the (shocking) amount  of money it costs to play there. That said,  if cost is not an issue for you, it looks like the place can be fun for the kids or Grandkids. **NOTE** We did not play there because of the high cost of admission - we found that Chutes and Ladders - also in Bloomington - is free and although it is outdoors, the Grandkidos had a terrific time and is one of their favorite places to play. Mind you, it is not a daycare, so a parent, grandparent etc. is best to stay and play for the safest, fun time!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ayantu Backup⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: my little ones got very sick after our last visit.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

However, some parents don't watch their kids and those kids ruin some activities for other kids, especially the younger ones. There is a designated section for kids under 2 that constantly had older kids running around in it.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Stephanie Swanson⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: This is a really nice indoor playground in Woodbury. There are two play structures with slides and climbing walls/ladders, a big swing (like a tire swing, but more a disc than a tire), a fake turf area with soccer balls and hula hoops and cones, an obstacle course area, a two and under play area, foam building blocks, and a big ""pillow"" for jumping. There are also places to take a break, including a reading room and nursing rooms. My 2.5 year old was done after about an hour, but my 6 year old could've stayed all day. I'm glad that you can go in/out with your code and there's a pretty large area to sit and eat. I was able to take my younger child to Culver's while the older one stayed with a grandparent and we ate our food and then played for more time.⏎ ⏎ The only thing I don't like is that there are no staff there. When we were there today there was a kid who pretty clearly was just dropped off. He couldn't have been more than 6. He was an absolute menace. He was pushing kids and throwing their foam blocks and yelling at kids and adults alike. I encountered this kid in several different areas and he never had anyone with him. I just wish there was even one person on site to report these kinds of things to. Kids shouldn't be abandoned at an indoor playground for who knows how long, and without staff on site there's nothing stopping people from leaving their children there unattended. I hope that kid is ok.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Cassadee Mo⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ryan & Joy W.⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Wonderful place for kids to play.

While there were several engaging features, I noticed some areas that could benefit from improvements to ensure a safer and more enriching visit for everyone.⏎ ⏎ One of my main concerns was the bouncy pad. It appears that if children cannot easily reach the higher, air-filled section, the pad becomes flat and potentially dangerous. Unfortunately, my daughter slipped there, resulting in a minor injury to her head and nose. This design might need reevaluation to ensure that all children, regardless of their ability to reach the top, remain safe.⏎ ⏎ Additionally, the selection of building blocks was somewhat limited. For children who enjoy creative play, having a wider variety of building materials could greatly enhance their experience. It also seemed that sharing was not as encouraged as it could be, which sometimes hindered cooperative play among the kids and parents present.⏎ ⏎ The baby area was modest and felt a bit underwhelming compared to the other zones. Enhancing this area with more engaging, age-appropriate activities might make it a more attractive option for families with younger children.⏎ ⏎ The ninja area had potential, but I observed several instances of unsupervised children lingering after falls, even though the rules clearly specify that parental supervision is required. Strengthening the oversight in this area could help maintain both safety and the intended flow of activities.⏎ ⏎ Given the price of $12 per child, I felt that the overall experience did not quite match the cost. Unfortunately, based on my visit, I don't plan to return.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Pa Yeng Lee⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Clean and decent size.

Jumpy pillow, little rock climbing wall, soccer field with green carpet and a couple of slides. They also have foam building block area but missing some pieces.  Reading room, changing station for babies and nursing room are great additions as well as separate play area for kids under 2.

I would consider this Good Times Park similar to the Eagan location. The main difference is that there is not a basketball court like the Eagan location.⏎ ⏎ Overall, the facility was clean and orderly.  When we were there, the net around the field was damaged on one side. It's not a huge problem, but it does need to get fixed.⏎ ⏎ The Ninja course did have kids climbing all over it. My daughter had a tough time playing in this area  due to the number of kids on the equipment. Would not be as big of a problem if the rules were being followed.⏎ ⏎ Other than that, this is a nice place to bring the kids for some activity when the weather is not nice.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: M V⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: We've gone to both the Eagan location and the Woodbury location. The concept of the park is great but we won't be returning and don't recommend it for families with young toddlers/infants. We went to the Woodbury location on 12/13/24. Although there are signs with rules everywhere we saw too many people not following them. It made us feel uncomfortable. There were two bigger boys (unsupervised) tossing a football on the bounce pad with lots of little toddlers around. My son is 1 and so I had to take him away in case he got hit by the ball. Every single time my son wanted to play with the blocks in the blocks area there would be 1 or 2 kids playing with ALL of the blocks. The second time we tried playing a grandmother told me her grandson was playing with all of them (there has to be at least 50 blocks there). I had to tell my disappointed 1 year old that he couldn't play because the kid wouldn't share. The dining area had food crumbs on the tables and floor. This is disappointing because cleaning supplies are provided and people still don't clean up after themselves. We won't return since there are no staff to regulate the rules.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Taylor Limbeck⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: Need more benches, Not enough seating for parents.

You can see an inch of dust under the equipment (especially under the slides on the right side), and the dust bunnies are floating around the room. I felt like my eyes were itchy and we didn't stay long because of it.⏎ ⏎ As others pointed out in their reviews, this place STINKS and they need to figure out why. Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.⏎ ⏎ More ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.⏎ ⏎ I'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashlei Kraemer⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Not enough seating but kids of all ages loved it!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jake Kvanbeck⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jamall Dyar⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: My kids love this indoor playground as it definitely provides hours of fun.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

As a first-time mom, cleanliness is incredibly important to me, and Alexia goes above and beyond to make things as clean and drool-free as possible :) I love how the toy selection is perfectly curated for a range of ages!! My son finds something new to play with every time we go to open play, and we’ve been members since it opened! (If you have kids you know how fast they get sick of toys, so this is a BIG plus) We’re really looking forward to the new membership offerings starting in the fall.

Hope to see you again soon! …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashley Jensen⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: I have three critiques and LOTS OF GOOD THINGS about our experience, I'm going to drop the critiques first because lets be honest, that's why most of us read reviews.⏎ ⏎ 1. I really wish there was a large digital clock on the wall so I didn't have to keep pulling out my phone to see the time.⏎ ⏎ 2. The price - we gotta talk about the price since it is probably most people's hesitation to visiting. For the size of the gym and what they offer, the price is STEEP. Especially with all of the other indoor play areas in the metro area. A price like $18.99 per child, siblings discounted to $16.99 should 1000000% include same day re-entry. I feel like this is a total oversight and missed opportunity to gain a solid customer base in the area. **Worth mentioning that on Facebook, the pricing says it has changed to $15.99/child and $13.99/sibling, but the WRTS website still lists $18.99/$16.99. With tax, it was $17.33 for my son to play on 6/3/2025**⏎ ⏎ Not to mention, the Monthly Memberships : 1 child for $250; 2 children for $300; 3 children for $380; 4 children for $450 is wild. You would have to go 14 times to even pay for the membership cost. This is another financial aspect that doesn't feel appropriate for the location based on what's also available for options nearby.⏎ ⏎ To put it in perspective, the Minnesota Children's Museum has daily entry of $16-19 and a YEARLY membership of $160-260. This includes three entire floors of play areas and experiences.⏎ ⏎ I know that WRTS is new to the area and obviously wants to stick around for a long time, but having more accessible pricing would definitely make more families visit. The Little Village in CG has figured out the pricing of memberships perfectly for the area, IMO.⏎ ⏎ 3. Although having a mini store of things to buy is cool, it's like walking my ND kid into a gift shop and I was not expecting to navigate that upon entry.⏎ ⏎ NOW ON TO THE GOOD THINGS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY!!! When asked how many stars my son would rate WRTS, he said ""infinite because this is the best place I have ever been to"".⏎ ⏎ 1. There was no unnecessary music playing! YAY!!! We were prepared with our noise canceling headphones, but it was such a relief that there was no music playing.⏎ ⏎ 2. The area had a vast array of swings, pretend play toys, a trampoline, a climbing dome, life sized building blocks, a massive Tetris and connect four and so many books.⏎ ⏎ 3. There are some tables in the entry area where you can sit and eat a snack or lunch if you packed them. They also have a vending machine with some items in it (my son is GF and I think there were only two GF items but that's better than none). We will definitely plan to pack a snack for next time.⏎ ⏎ 4. Accommodations in the bathroom for littles. A simple step stool and potty seat goes such a long way.⏎ ⏎ 5. A changing room for any size child.⏎ ⏎ 6. I know WRTS can't control their customer base, but every parent I spoke to while we were there was so kind and it felt good to be in a play area where other parents ""just get it"". It builds a kind of community that we all desperately need.⏎ ⏎ 7. I appreciate the fact that there were so many small pieced toys to play with (magnets, puzzles, etc), even though those would be a nightmare to pick up at the end of the day, its such a fun thing for the kids to play with while they visit.⏎ ⏎ 8. We have been considering a sensory swing for my son's room for a while now but we haven't been able to determine which one he wanted. After our visit, and his ability to test out all the swings there, we know which one he wants! It was an unintentional sensory swing testing area, hahaha.⏎ ⏎ 9. We were able to find toys that we loved that we never would have thought to try or buy before.⏎ ⏎ 10. There is counter seating at the half wall so parents could sit and watch their kids if they wanted. I didn't look to see if there were plug-ins at the wall to charge electronics, but that would be cool if there was. But also nbd if there isn't.⏎ ⏎ Overall, my son can't wait to go back and we will return! I'm out of space to type anymore LOL.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Amy Hinner⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: I have a 6 year old boy with autism, he has refused to leave the house for the last year and a half.

The play area was messy and disorganized despite us being the first to attend that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alejandra Marquez⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: I was excited to see that We Rock the Spectrum was coming to the Twin Cities after taking my son to a location in the Nashville area while on vacation. We left that facility with a very positive view of the company and were looking forward to taking him again.⏎ ⏎ We were only the second family to arrive early on a Thursday morning, and it was clear that the facility had not been cleaned the night before. The seating area was still full of crumbs. There were small toys scattered all over the gym as well, demonstrating that the floor couldn't possibly have been cleaned and definitely nothing had been sanitized. Also, no soap dispensers in the women's bathroom were functional.⏎ ⏎ We were most looking forward to the zipline, which my son got to try in Nashville and loved. However, I don't think the zipline setup at this location is safe. The lane of padding was too narrow and metal supports in the middle (where a child is most likely to fall off) had no padding at all. My son did fall off, bounce off the padding and onto the floor, and didn't want anything to do with the zipline after that.⏎ ⏎ Also, I realize that a fire exit is necessary and required by law, but the one here is very much accessible to any ambulatory child. Many autistic children, mine included, are practiced and efficient elopers. My son tried to make a quick exit outside with effectively no barrier to stop him.⏎ ⏎ Honestly, the pricing at this place is also completely bananas. Good Times is $24 a month, Inneractive is $36 a month, and Eagle's Nest is $9 a day. Unless there is something specific at We Rock the Spectrum that your child really enjoys, you're much better off at one of their local competitors if you're just looking to burn some energy during a rainy day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Emily Nielsen⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: I personally think the Spectrum should be open to everyone even when there is a birthday event and only just reserve the private room for birthday and unique events. Today it was snowing outside and there were too many people at Good Times Park. Good Times Park is not the right fit for my son.⏎ ⏎ My son has autism, born with poymicrogyria, he is a neurodivergent child. He  kept on saying he wants to go swinging, it crushed my heart to see him smiling and so excited when we arrived at We Rock Spectrum. The owner gave me a free pass to go for the next time we return. I do appreciate it. But I think this kind of policy should be adjusted.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: David R.⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Great experience!

The Woodbury location is HUGE, the owner and her family are wonderful people. I also have a young infant and loved the huge changing room, and ESPECIALLY loved the adult changing tables, which is something rare to find for a parent who has an older child still in diapers. There are so many activities to do for all ages from infants to adults with special needs. And the swings can hold up to 300 lbs, accommodating for larger children/adults with special needs. My kids' favorite thing was the zip line! They have a nice party room for activities and events.

The kids had a blast running around, playing together, eating pizza, and enjoying the party room. We have attended other birthday parties here and it is a fun place for toddlers to elementary age kids. Great value birthday party spot for kids.

I was super grossed out here...It would be stretching for this to even be a free place to go. Everything is so warn out and grubby and in bad shape and feels unsanitary. It's kind of like a bunch of garage sale items that should've been thrown away instead of sold, all compiled together. Most material is so warn down you can see the insides. The germs and junk from the wear and tear has to be just caked into every crevice there. Honestly the whole thing needs to be completed gutted and redone. There is a strong chemical smell upon entering - like a bad cleaning agent - almost like kitty litter chemicals. The chairs available for parents to sit are so sunken and low and hard and you can't see your kids from the sitting area. There are so many enclosed places for kids to hide that it's a recipe for disaster as far as keeping your kids safe. We immediately washed all of our clothes upon returning home and felt like we even needed showers. Hard pass for me, there's many other play places in the general area that are much much better at the same or even more affordable pricing.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Moa AQIB Trans Llc⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: I have to say very clean and organized but very Horrible people very disrespectful in front of my child.

Also the area where customers keep there things (cubbies and lockers) were very dirty. I understand it’s winter but the cubbies appeared to not be cleaned in a long time. And the odor from all of the lockers (where I had to keep my son’s diaper bag) was foul.

There are some down sides. Just FYI, we drove an hrs to here. 1st, the clark don’t seem friendly. 2nd, all the cues including the mini lockers are super dirty, I don’t have a place to put my diaper bag, baby carrier or our jackets so I ended up putting on the table. 3rd, the sink water in the bathroom is super cold, uncomfortable after washing your hands, especially this time of the year. And finally my biggest concern is that there is NO outside food/snacks are allowed but yet, they only sell junk food. I understand this is a small business and they want us to support them by buying their snacks. However; We are strictly don’t do chips or junk food for our kids. Only fruits, vegetables & water is our usual snacks. Therefore, we have to leave after an hours & half. Try eating in the car but it’s uncomfortable. Finding a place is a bit challenging for us due to our diet & lot of fast food around here. We ended up just going to a friend house and ended up not returning. It’s an awesome playground but will not be coming back. I found it’s inconvenient as a parents and for lot of parents especially if you bring more than 2 kids. Driving back and forth and parking are limited.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: J Maloney⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: This place was great for a multi age group of kids.

They do not have enough people present to monitor their facility.  They allow too many people inside at any given time, and it results in a very chaotic experience.  Staff threw a table at children that didn’t understand what the staff was saying.⏎ ⏎ Mini-golf is neat, but the course is very poorly maintained.  Random bits of felt all over the place that make playing un-fun.   Again, little monitoring of the others participating, and it results in golfballs going flying.  We were hit by multiple balls due to the design of the course, and the people behind not caring about rules.  Having a person to enforce rules is necessary for a place this busy.  My family and I will not be going back for any other activities.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Danielle McClain⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: I do want to say this was a really neat indoor playground. It was pretty clean and has cool things for kids to play with.⏎ ⏎ HOWEVER, because of the ball pit cannon, it was pretty loud inside and a little overwhelming for my 19 month old. Also, the little toddler area has no separation between the big kid area, and so we finally left after my child was pushed over twice (after being there less than an hour) from some roudy big kids that were in the toddler area. It's a cool place to visit, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have little littles.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Andrew Plush⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: We took our kids for the first time today, and we will definitely be back!

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

I purchased a $16 cheese and fruit plate that was full of old/bruised fruit. I kindly asked if they could remake the plate because my children have sensory issues and wouldn’t eat the fruit. When they remade it, they gave us less than HALF the food that was on the original plate. When I asked them where the rest of the cheese was, they said “the cheese assortment is at random, that’s just how we do it.” It was insanely busy and I didn’t want to cause any delays for other families, but I am SO disappointed. They served me slivers of apple peels on the second plate, FOUR crackers, and a small pile of Swiss cheese that my children obviously wouldn’t eat. I feel like they did this deliberately, as the employees looked annoyed I even brought the plate to their attention. For $16, food should be fresh and stored properly to avoid bruising and spoiling. They would not give me a refund. Though my kids love this place, I don’t think we’ll be visiting again because of the blatant disrespect. I spend hundreds of dollars here a month, so I expected a little more kindness and care. The first photo is what they initially served me, and the second photo is what the replacement plate had on it.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: W1LD⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: This place is a great place for parents to hang out with other parents, and kids to hang out with other kids.

Not so cheap beer and junk food snacks which are okay. Honestly, the best part about this place is how tired it makes my kid so that he goes to bed easy at night.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: hunter badour⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Our kid always have so much fun here, though some parents need to watch their kids better because some get too rough, they don't have a staff member to ""police"" them.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Grace Blesch⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: I could not believe the state of the womens bathroom! Disgusting! The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in months, the toilet seat cover holder was pulled off the wall and laying on the floor, toilets were stained with urine, trash and filth everywhere, no trash bag in the trash can! The health department needs to be called. I would not allow my child to use this restroom. We left immediately. Get your shit together and hire enough staff to clean! Bathrooms should be checked every 30 mins. Wish I had taken a photo but I could not get out of there fast enough.

The price was quite fair, I  spent two hours playing with my kiddo in the tower. There were other adults playing with their kids in there too. A good time was had by all. The staff do their best to maintain it, and we overheard some of them complain they didn’t have the right dusters to get some of the tops of the slides despite their best efforts. They did their best to keep it clean and tidy. The lattes were good, and staff were friendly and courteous.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Diveana Mass y Rubi⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Excellent place to spend a pleasant time with the family, and children can also entertain themselves with new friends.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christopher Benjamin⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Very large indoor playground for kids.

They charged us for graffiti balloons and never said anything about it, they gave us flack as kids didnt go in the play area as most of them were under 3 yrs old. Customer services was bad.

My request to pay for 30 minutes rejected. Been asked to pay $11.42 with explanation that price is raised. Weird amount. Always paid rounded number before.

My kids get amped up at other play places (so much running, screaming, etc.) so Hullabaloo was a refreshing change in that it’s curated to invite kids to *actually* play.  It feels like a mix between a preschool and a science museum. My kids loved it!

The play space is one large open space, with one open door, so you can easily watch more than one child if you have multiples. There's a variety of things for kids to keep busy and quite honestly, keep adults entertained as well (or maybe it's just me who is easily entertained). My toddler had a blast exploring everything! My 5-year-old immediately gravitated to the space themed items.}","{}"

There is a nice indoor waterfall area outside of the playground that my kids enjoyed as well.⏎ ⏎ Downsides: no food at the tables, though drinks are permitted. If your kid is timid and wants you to go through with them the first few times some of the crawl spaces are extremely tight for the grown-ups - wear your workout pants! A lot of the crawl spaces are very dark, which my kids didn't prefer. The bigger slides are super fast compared to most playgrounds we frequent (indoor or outdoor) so the kids only went down the big ones twice.

Everything is roped/gated off to try to prevent any leaving, but the desk where you check in was not paying attention to much more than their phone.⏎ The issues I had: parents were NOT watching their children and no one was enforcing the rules (no running, screaming, rough housing). Many times older kids would come chasing each other, literally screaming, and it scared some of the younger children and made it hard to enjoy. Most parents were sitting to the side on their phone or computer. I wish there was more enforcement and accountability on staff and parents end of things to make the park enjoyable for all visiting. I wouldn’t recommend this place for anyone under 3 (most were school age kids there running).⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christina Marchand⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 years ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Carlos Lobos⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 3 years ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jeanne B.

The best part about this playground is that it's inside the Woodbury library and has a nature center area. I've never been to a place that has so many things to offer at 1 location! Also, you have to check out the waterfalls inside! They're are beautiful and peaceful.. This is a wonderful place to have  lunch, business meetings, remote working, or just a peaceful place to read. The best part about the park is that parents are free and the kids are 5.50 per child. We took 7 kids with 3 adults, and it was a wonderful time! We definitely will be back soon!

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

However, the unexpected closures due to private events have been really frustrating. I completely understand the need to close for private parties — it’s a great way to provide a special experience. But it would be much better if these closures were communicated in advance. It’s really disappointing to show up only to find out it's closed, especially when we could’ve planned something else for the day. My little one was heartbroken and cried when we couldn’t go in because of a private party.⏎ ⏎ Another confusing part is that the map and online listings show the hours as 9 AM to 6 PM, which makes us think it’s open. That adds to the frustration when we arrive and it’s not. Now, we feel like we have to call every time before visiting just to be sure. Clearer communication would really help families like ours plan better and avoid disappointment.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashley Houck⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: We are from the cities but every time we come⏎ visit the grandparents in Fargo my daughters INSIST on visiting the gym!

I rated it 4/5 as we had our son's birthday party and we were notified a week prior to the party on their restriction. The first 1.5 hours are in the gym and the last 30 minutes is reserved for cake/food and presents in the party room as they need time to clean up the gym and do not want kids eating and then playing on the equipment leading to them becoming sick. The website states, ""Access to entire facility for 2 hours."" This is not true. We, all the kids, presents, decorations, and food had to be out by the five o'clock time. (our rental was 3-5) This lead to much stress. I also missed out on my son opening half of his gifts and thanking the parents for coming. . You are allowed 30 minutes to set up. 15 minutes would have been perfect and then 15 to take down and pack would have been better. In the end, we will not be having another birthday party here⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Danielle Hendrickson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: My son is autistic and we travel 4 hours to Fargo every 3 months for therapy and doctors and we ALWAYS end our Fargo trip at we rock the spectrum.

With a mission that boldly declares, ""Finally a place where you never have to say I'm sorry,"" this gym is truly a haven for children of all abilities.⏎ ⏎ My eleven-year-old son and I spent a weekend exploring the sensory-friendly activities offered at We Rock the Spectrum, and it was an experience that left us in awe. The gym boasts an extensive range of equipment, each thoughtfully designed to cater to various sensory needs. From suspended swings for balance and vestibular treatment to crash mats and pillows for fun, motor planning, and strength, the gym has it all.⏎ ⏎ One standout feature is the zip slider, providing stress release and promoting joint and body relaxation. The trampoline offers a fantastic opportunity for building leg and core strength, while the indoor play structure enhances climbing skills and playground expertise. The inclusion of sensory-based toys and equipment is a testament to the gym's commitment to improving auditory processing and fine motor skills.⏎ ⏎ We Rock the Spectrum goes beyond physical activities, offering a fine motor and arts and crafts area that aids in improving hand-eye coordination. The calming room, designed for regulating emotions and reducing negative sensory input, is a thoughtful touch, providing a quiet space for children to find balance.⏎ ⏎ During our visit, my son, although initially overwhelmed by the new environment, showed genuine interest and enthusiasm. Despite not lasting long during our first visit, he expressed a desire to return—a testament to the gym's engaging and accommodating atmosphere.⏎ ⏎ Not only did our time at We Rock the Spectrum provide a fun and inclusive experience, but it also offered valuable insights into new equipment that can benefit my son at home. The gym's commitment to inclusivity and overall awesomeness earns it a well-deserved 10/10 rating. We Rock the Spectrum is more than just a gym; it's a supportive community that understands and embraces the diverse needs of every child. I highly recommend this extraordinary space to families seeking a place where their children can play, grow, and thrive without limitations.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kayla Barr⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Such a great environment for kids to explore and learn!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.⏎ ⏎ More ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.⏎ ⏎ I'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashlei Kraemer⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Not enough seating but kids of all ages loved it!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jake Kvanbeck⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jamall Dyar⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: My kids love this indoor playground as it definitely provides hours of fun.

The mother wasn’t paying attention at all and was even in a different room for a while. The mother was addressed about his actions and she didn’t care and was rather rude.

The mother wasn’t paying attention at all and was even in a different room for a while. The mother was addressed about his actions and she didn’t care and was rather rude. The problem with the child continued so the staff was asked if they could intervene as she wasn’t even in the play area or supervising. They said they don’t get involved, and it wasn’t their problem.

This indoor playground is an absolute gem for families with little ones. There’s such a wide variety of toys and play structures that kept our almost 23 month old boy happily entertained the entire visit. From imaginative play to climbing and crawling, there’s truly something for every age and interest.⏎ ⏎ One feature we especially loved was the separate, sectioned-off area for children 2 and under. While younger kiddos can absolutely enjoy the entire play area, it’s really thoughtful and comforting to have a space just for them to explore more safely and at their own pace.⏎ ⏎ Everything was very clean, well-maintained, and clearly cared for—which makes a big difference in a space like this! The snack and drink vending machine was also a much-appreciated bonus for parents and kiddos who need a quick break and refreshment without having to leave the space.⏎ ⏎ Highly recommend Wild Child to anyone with young kids looking for indoor fun in La Crosse! We’ll definitely be back.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alex⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: Wild Child is an amazing indoor playground for smaller kids.

From the moment we walked in, the vibrant colors and exciting energy were contagious. My children, ages 3 and 7, were immediately captivated by the variety of play structures. The multi-level climbing area kept my older one engaged, while the dedicated toddler zone provided a safe and stimulating environment for my youngest.⏎ What truly impressed me was the cleanliness and the attentive staff. The entire facility was spotless, and the staff members were friendly, helpful, and clearly focused on ensuring everyone's safety and enjoyment. It's such a relief to find a place where kids can burn off energy in a secure and well-maintained setting.⏎ Wildchild offers more than just climbing and sliding; the interactive games and obstacle courses added an extra layer of fun and challenge. It's the perfect spot for a rainy day adventure or just a fun outing to get the wiggles out. We left with two happy, tired kids and can't wait to visit Wildchild again soon! Highly recommend!!

The inside of this play café is very aesthetically pleasing, but also colorful for a child’s visual appeal. The owner is super friendly and engaging with all guests and children. I attended a fun Easter/Bluey event, and my 3 year old and her friend had a blast! There were crafts, snacks, gift bags, an egg hunt, and lots of fun & music with Bluey! Great selection of imaginative play toys and different ball pits to fit the needs of all age groups, from babies to toddlers! The calming/sensory room was very relaxing. Very reasonable and fair pricing. Plenty of places to sit while your children play.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

Our 1 year old was in need of a fun stop to play and this place was perfect. Really enjoyed my drink, which I could sip while watching him play in a safe, fun enclosed space. I noticed they took extra care to make sure it was “childproof” even putting electrical covers on behind furniture.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

There was about ten adults with sneakers on and no one made them take them off or or put covers over them. Walking around in my socks while they were they with their dirty sneakers. Doesn't make sense. There was no order and kids arriving for the party had no clue they had to check in. Run by little teenagers with walkie talkies who have no idea how to run a small place.

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).  We would go back anytime, but on a day when it was 95 degrees outside and you have a little one that wants to go to a playground, this place was a life saver.

Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks?

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Riggott⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review, Jacob!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Larson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: An amazing play place!

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

The play area is very safe and clean and provides a great variety of activities. Bathrooms are super clean and even have kid size potty seats. The snack options are perfect, the sensory room is so cool and unique, and there is a private feeding area. I am so excited to try out their new co-working program!⏎ ⏎ UPDATED:⏎ I finally got to try out their co-working program as our daycare was closed today. WOW what a great experience! My daughter had a specific child minder look after her for 3 hours while I worked in their quiet workspace. I could see her via cameras the entire time! She spent about half the time playing with other children in the main play area and the other half one on one with the child minder (Amanda!) in their classroom doing activities, games, and art. They provided her with a snack and provided me with free coffee! The only time I had to pause work was to take my daughter to the bathroom. My daughter had a great time and talked about how much fun she had with Amanda the rest of the day. Amanda shared her observations with me after her morning with my daughter, she clearly has a strong background in child development.

As a Grandma, I love that everything is so clean and bright and fun, and as a preschool teacher, I was thrilled to see the developmentally appropriate activities geared towards the use of imagination.

I have a 5 year old and an 11 month old and there were things to keep both boys very busy. Stomping Grounds is a bit of a drive for us but 1000% worth it. It is incredibly clean - they even have 30 minute breaks between play sessions to clean and sanitize! This was the first play cafe I’ve gone to where I didn’t feel like my children were sure to catch a cold from! The food and drink options were great and very reasonably priced. My kids and I had a great experience and we will be back very soon!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Andrea⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Sydney Dutmer⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: There is something significant that can be said about a play cafe like Stomping Grounds. It is not often as parents that you find somewhere that you can truly relax, knowing your child is contained in a safe play area, with a wide variety of incredibly fun toys and equipment.⏎ ⏎ Every time we visit Stomping Grounds, it feels CLEAN! This is a huge differentiating factor for us, and it is why we frequently make the almost 30 minute drive down to Caledonia, rather than going to more local play cafes. Knowing that toys and surfaces have been cleaned well, multiple times per day is a huge relief. The idea of offering several 2 hour play sessions throughout the day, and closing for 30 minutes between each to clean and reset speaks volumes about their priorities.⏎ ⏎ You can tell the owners and staff truly care about the wellbeing of the kids. They are engaged, and take extremely good care of the facility. The care and thought they have put in to making the space accessible and fun for ALL kids, should also be recognized. The “zen den,” which is a low stimulation room, is such a great idea, and addresses a clear gap missing from the Play Cafe community.⏎ ⏎ They offer a great variety of kid friendly snacks, including a large variety of drinks and treats from local businesses, including several who are owned and operated by women, and businesses who employ individuals with disabilities. While i would love to keep this hidden gem a secret, i would be remiss to not encourage others to experience and support such a wonderful Play Cafe!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Cait Romain⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: All I can say is WOW!

Ages 2-5 loved it! Plenty to keep them busy for their 2 hour time slot. Slides, climbing, smaller toys, dress up, etc.⏎ ⏎ My only criticism is that you can't bring in food (unless it's from a couple specific local restaurants). There are snack and drink options for purchase, and they aren't completely unreasonable, but it is a little frustrating to be met with a display of tasty items to have to pull your kids away from (especially if you have more than one kiddo you have to negotiate with- ""we have food in the car... Let's head out and I'll get you something!"" 😏). With a play fee of $10 per kid, it seems maybe a small snack could be included. (ie goldfish, fruit snack, zollipop, etc).⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christine Westfall⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Great spot for a Little's birthday party!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jonathan Hubble⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Angela Hoecker⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: So much fun!

I have visited many Play Cafes and I have noticed that some of them were not that safe & actually my kid had an injury at one recently because their floor was concrete (half of it at least)!!!  This play cafe in Caledonia is amazing because they have a blocked out area for the kids (gated), the floor is soft and clean, and they also placed a mattress at the bottom of the slide for just in case.  All of the toys are wooden, which is kind of like a Montessori style school, & there was not one single toy that seemed to be a chocking hazard!  Also, their food is great & healthy & even their healthy popsicles are amazing!  Glad they are here & I would recommend going.

The main play area is only for kids 6 and under and it is enclosed on all sides by a baby gate so the kids cannot access the outside doors. They have tables and activities for kids 7 and older. This is makes the play area great for very little ones. They have a max of 20 kids per 2 hour play session so it keeps the area less chaotic than other places. There is a “zen den” for kids to take a break in if needed- great for neurodivergent kids. My baby is 10 months and had a great time. Very clean, organized, and well thought out. We can’t wait to go back!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Cori Wilber⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: This place is laid out SO WELL. But my favorite thing is that you can book online and there's a limited number of spots available in each play session. Play sessions are 2 hrs and we normally stay at places like this about 1.5 hrs, so it worked out really well. I get pretty overwhelmed in loud busy places but I don't think i would here with the number of kids they allow at a time. Plus everything was really clean and they disinfect between each session.⏎ ⏎ I'd love to show you photos that we took during our time at Stomping Grounds, but we were having so much fun that I forgot to take any!! We are big fans of Melissa and Doug style / Montessori toys, and my kids liked everything here! I especially liked the wall activities in the loft part. My oldest son loved the kitchen play space.

Then when we arrived, I loved the layout even more than the pictures showed. Perfectly contained and laid out so you can see your child where ever you’re sitting and know that they can’t run away into an unsafe area when you look away for a second. My daughter also loved the cheese and meat snack packs they had. So nice to have a healthier option available. Over all I will definitely be coming again!

One thing that impressed me was that even though it’s not a giant space or anything, the toy/play selection was so varied. My kid loved the vehicles and awesome car rug in particular and that’s not always something these places have. I loved how everything felt really high quality and intentionally chosen.⏎ On a different note— both me and my kid have a hard time in chaotic environments. The main play area has no noisy toys and is great for a parent like me who gets really flustered with loud wild kid play spaces. Also love that there are a limited number of spots for each play time— really helps with it not feeling super loud and crowded.⏎ But also!! They have a little sensory quiet space for kiddos who need to have some space from the other play area. We spent about 10-15 mins in there and it was really great for my kiddo to take an introvert break before going back out to play.⏎ We aren’t local, but if we were, I’m sure we’d be here weekly.

This place is only slightly more engaging than a free chick fila play area, and definitely not as engaging as a real playground. I was very disappointed. Maybe if you bring more than one kid it might be better. They also don’t have water or food to purchase (or at least not on the day we visited).

I get that they are a small business but to charge almost $20 for 1 child and not even giving a discount for walking in an hour before they close is unfortunate. Also their toy machine is ""sleeping on the weekends"" is also ridiculous, stop being cheap and you might get more repeat business.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Connor Gurule⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: We drove up from the springs and it was worth it. It's small enough that you don't get the sprinting big kids knocking littles over and it's big enough that the toddlers don't get bored!⏎ ⏎ Perfect middle ground to me.⏎ ⏎ The plane simulator should consider screen recording some Microsoft flight sim footage of our area but other than that I have no notes lol.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Courtney Payne⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 9 months ago⏎ Review: I want to love this place, but the swing in the middle of the playroom is a major issue. When a child swings, they hit others, and since many of the kids are toddlers without much awareness, I saw numerous children getting struck (my own included) and parents having to pull them out of the way. The swing is positioned directly in the middle of the playroom, blocking the entrance to the play structure, so kids have to dodge it to get in. My one-year-old can’t walk and play freely because she’s at risk of being hit. I hoped the swing would be addressed on my recent visit, but it hasn’t been changed. The lack of staff oversight makes me hesitant to return⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: David Tice⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thank you so much for 5 stars David!

The staff were friendly and whilst being strict, they let kids be kids and play.⏎ We haven’t been in a long time and it’s like they don’t want kids to play anymore. I’m a very strict mom as I have 4 kids and I am very much Type A, but after today, I’m thinking I’m a softy!⏎ If they’re not allowed to spin on the silk swing, then maybe don’t put it up. In the same breath, other kids used the swing exactly the same way as mine and didn’t once get told off.⏎ It’s summer - I get it, everyone’s a bit frustrated with noisy boisterous kids, but this is an indoor kids play space where maybe 8 other kids were playing alongside mine. They were all completely fine - no need to be so snappy.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Craig Foster⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: Overall my kids love the place and the gals running  the front desk are great.   The reason for the 4-star and not 5 is the new sock policy where they charge you $3 for 25 cent disposable socks.   At least the rec center provides quality socks for the same price.   It’s a bummer to see good businesses trying to make money on minuscule things like this.   A better business model would be to provide these cheap socks free of charge until everyone is aware of the new policy.  Or at least provide something of better quality.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Hosanna Deseno⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Clean, fun, and lots to do!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Taylor Pruitt⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: The CUTEST kids place!

It's rather small and not enough activities for my almost 3 y/o to keep him entertained. As others have said, the simulator is just a video on loop.

My daughter wears AFOS (ankle braces) to be able to get around. The safest way for her to wear them is with shoes on. I always alert staff at places like this when we arrive and this is the first time a toddler play place treated us like second class citizens. I explained to the staff working that her AFOS are medical devices and they looked back and forth at each other. They did let her wear her shoes, but subjected me to a 2 minute lecture on safety. Essentially mom shaming me for even requesting my kid have an accommodation to play with her peers. Absolutely disgusted with the staff.⏎ ⏎ Besides the staff being ridiculously rude when it comes to disabilities it’s a great place to play for a 2 year old.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Dave Lowry⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: We hosted my kids birthday here and they were fantastic!

I drove 30+ minutes down there to see a sign on the door that they closed early. I called today to ask for my money back and they told me that the pass doesn’t expire, I can use it any time, but they cannot give me a refund. I explained I don’t live close, was disappointed with my experience, but still, no refund.

My kids had a lot of fun and for that reason, I might consider coming back. We checked it out on a Saturday which I know probably isn't the best time to go. I was surprised at how many adults and kids they allowed in at once. It was overcrowded in the play area and the sitting area. Pricing is also on the higher side. Not only for single admission but membership too. For your money, there are plenty of better options with more to offer for play and learning, more space, and less crowded. I'm not opposed to coming back when it's less busy but the price alone makes me willing to look elsewhere.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Claudia Trejo⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: Super fun playground.

I’d say the best thing Kids Landing could offer is a limit of how many kids at once, or time slots? We were there for about an hour before a private party also accompanied the already 18 kids there, which added another 12 kids. This place simply cannot handle crowds of this size, nor does it have enough to do to occupy that many.⏎ Great idea for Castle Rock, but not a great location, along with everything inside feeling lackluster.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Shemae Inscoe⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: The staff and facilitiy is pretty good but I would have to rate our satisfaction level sort of low.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend it and will not be coming back. It is $18 for one child! That is more expensive than children's museum and it's definitely not worth it. It is literally one play structure which was hard for my 3 year old to navigate by himself and questionable safety-wise as there are open holes. There was maybe 7 other children playing while we were there and it was so loud (again, one room). The ""flight simulator"" had like one button for children to push and didn't even do anything - so like the other reviewer mentioned, to advertise this as a feature is quite the stretch.

I swear they have thought of everything- from a toddler play area to a flight simulator section to the play structure even being parent friendly! Wow!! As a mom of 2 under 2 I am limited with where I can take my kids and it be somewhere affordable, small kid friendly, easy access for parents to play or supervise their kids, and not have to drive 20+ minutes to. My daughter is 21 months and she LOVED it! The toddler area was perfect for containment and getting her comfortable before wanting to venture to the play structure. She wasn’t brave enough to go on her own, so my husband (who is 6 feet tall) went with her. He was able to navigate through the entire play structure with ease (which is SUPER impressive since most structures are small, cramped, and definitely only for kids which IMO isn’t great for the small ones who still need mom or dad’s help). After she went through the structure and down the slides one time we couldn’t pry her away. My husband and I took turns going through with her (I’m 5’3” and had no issues going through which is no surprise since my husband-again 6 feet tall- was able to run around with my daughter as well). She LOVED our time there and we will definitely become members. Perfect timing since winter is right around the corner and we need all the great indoor ideas and places. Will definitely be frequenting here and adding to our weekly routine. My daughter’s birthday is in January and it’s so hard to find things to do indoors that isn’t at our house. We will be renting the event room for sure!! It’s the perfect size and the glass walls allow parents to enjoy themselves and watch their kids. I am SO thankful for a safe, locally run and owned indoor play place for our kiddos. The owners are also such wonderful people. I love that they live here and want to invest in making Castle Rock better. The prices are more than reasonable and honestly could probably be higher so myself (and bank account) are thankful it’s more than affordable. Such an amazing addition to our community! Support local and enjoy your new favorite place to take your kiddos!!⏎ ⏎ Side note- I am not a fan of snacks with the first ingredient being high fructose corn syrup or that have massive amounts of added sugar. It’s refreshing to see an establishment that provides healthy snacks kids still love. Dried apples (or fruits) are favorites in my house and I haven’t met a kid that doesn’t like them. & thinking of the parents with protein bars, genius!! We need fuel too and rarely do I remember to pack snacks for me so THANK YOU!!⏎ I also appreciate the no alcohol policy-  as a parent who expects other parents to “parent” their children instead of using play areas for babysitting while they drink, this is the type of place I want to support.⏎ ⏎ Lastly- I’m sorry for the previous review. It was distasteful and not a truthful representation of your facility. I personally know you’re local and native to Colorado . Plus, no one should make public comments about your marriage when they do not know you or your financial/marital situation.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Evan Arai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: We LOVE this place!

As a bonus, the owners are Castle Rock residents...with small children of their own...and have been for years. They are following an age-old business maxim, ""find a consumer need, and fill it.""  Wishing much success to this venture.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tiffany Max⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: Attended the Grand Opening and my kids had a blast! I have a 7 year old and 4 year old and they both were entertained and busy for two hours straight! The climbing structure was a huge hit but they also enjoyed building with the Tetris tiles, the soft play shapes and the gel sensory floor tiles! Super cool vibe with bright colors and easy for parents to relax and keep an eye on the kiddos playing.

We really needed another play space for younger kids and it is adorable! My 4 year old son played on the play structure, slid down the slide, played with the lights and soft blocks and even the little blocks on the table and didn’t come up to me the entire hour+ we were there-not even to ask for a snack-that’s a win!!! The owners were very sweet and friendly. We will definitely be back to check it out!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kelsey Davies⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: The Kids Landing is exactly what Castle Rock needs! The place was packed with excited patrons when we visited during the grand opening. Our 5 year old loved the play gym, and our 2 year old had a blast in the soft play area. The venue is clean, well thought, and would be a great place to host a children's birthday party as the event room is wisely placed in the center with large windows to watch your little ones enjoy the amenities. We’re so happy for this new addition and will be visiting again soon! Definitely recommend.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Caley Jones⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 years ago⏎ Review: I (and our kids) absolutely loved this place! They could play all day.

Going swimming was more work that I wanted to manage for just a day trip, and we had planned to go to an out side playground to let off some steam before going home, but stumbled on this place after a Google search.

From the moment you walk in, it’s clear that every detail has been thoughtfully designed with families in mind. There is something here for every age — from toddlers exploring soft play zones to older kids climbing, sliding, building, and bouncing their way through creative and engaging areas.⏎ ⏎ The space is immaculately clean — truly spotless — which is a huge plus when you have little ones crawling and climbing around. The bathrooms are modern, spacious, and sparkling clean, and the adorable party rooms are perfect for birthday celebrations or group get-togethers.⏎ ⏎ One of our favorite surprises was the café! It’s not just your typical snack bar — it has a great selection of food and drinks (including coffee for the grown-ups!) and plenty of options to keep kids happy and fueled for more play.⏎ ⏎ The pricing is also incredibly reasonable, especially considering it’s all-day play! You can come and go as needed, and I love that it feels very secure — only those who have purchased a ticket receive a personalized entry code, which gives so much peace of mind.⏎ ⏎ Play Grounds of LaCrosse has truly thought of everything. It’s fun, safe, clean, and welcoming — a total gem for families looking to burn off energy and make lasting memories. We’ll definitely be back again and again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Miranda Ham⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: Edited a month ago⏎ Review: Good place to wear out kiddos. Pros; the jump pad thing is a huge hit- main thing my 9 year old wanted to do and cheap entry price. Cons; lack of supervision, not very clean, basketball court will have balls flying into the jump pad & ninja course, and lack of seating for adults. My son was super disappointed when kids were just sitting on the ninja course for 10+ minutes not playing, when asked nicely if he could go through they ignored him. I wasn't a fan of almost being hit by basketballs multiple times when I wasn't even in the basketball court. Most of the issues could be easily solved if the areas were monitored better and whoever monitors the areas could do general cleaning.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chrissy Johnson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: Hey Chrissy,⏎ Thanks for leaving us a 5 star review, we appreciate it!⏎ Erik⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Julie Vang⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: Feedback Regarding Party Room Booking Experience:⏎ ⏎ I’m writing to share some feedback regarding our recent experience hosting a party at your facility, which we booked from 6-8PM.⏎ ⏎ While the children had a wonderful time and we appreciated the timely arrival of the pizzas and the help provided by your on-site staff member, I did want to raise a few concerns that caused some confusion and disappointment.⏎ ⏎ According to the party room description, the booking includes “access to the facility for up to 10 kids for a total of three hours.” I scheduled our party room from 6-8PM (they have allotted time slots for you to select from) with the understanding that the children would have an hour of play after our reserved party room time (8-9PM). However, we were unaware that the facility itself closes at 8PM. This meant that we did not receive the full three hours of access that were advertised.⏎ ⏎ Are we advised to arrive early to make use of the extra hour of playtime? Additionally, no closing announcement was made to give us a heads-up before the facility shut down. We only became aware of the closing time when I asked to store the birthday cake (ice cream) around 7:45PM, which was also when we were scrambling to locate misplaced car keys while trying to clean up the party room.⏎ ⏎ While your staff member was kind and understanding in the moment, I left feeling disappointed that we unintentionally missed out on a full hour of what we paid for. A simple courtesy email ahead of time outlining the facility hours, or a reminder to arrive early for playtime, would have gone a long way toward clarifying expectations. As it stands, the experience felt misleading.⏎ ⏎ I’m sharing this in the hope that you might consider updating your communication process for future guests. I hope you’ll take this feedback into account for improving the overall experience.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jim Morris⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Cool place for kids 5 to 10!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Donavon Diderrich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: My Daughter loves going here.

Lots of play option,  amazing hours. My only complaint is that I wish there were 2 completely different sides with the same stuff, one side for under 10 year Olds and one side for over 10 year Olds. It's not practical to have older kids bouncing next to 5 year Olds, it's not practical to have grown men throwing basket balls and accidentally having it hit 3 year Olds in the head.  There should be separate or clear plexiglass walls . I also wish the disabled parking spaces have actual signs because when it's just painted on the ground,  the snow covers it. So far they keep the place clean which must be quite a challenge.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Hailey Bieniasz⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: Hey Hailey,⏎ Thanks for the 5 star review!⏎ ⏎ -Erik⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Theresa Marcus⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: Hey Theresa,⏎ Thanks for the 5 star review!⏎ ⏎ -Erik⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: mike crawford⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: The ninja course is challenging yet achievable for our 9 & 11 year old.

It’s a cool facility, very friendly staff, and lots to do for children closer to 4 I would say. At 2 years old, my kid was too big for the toddler area, but then got steam rolled a bit as it got busier in the main space. That’s to be expected in any playground with “big kids”. Just a note⏎ to parents for toddlers that it does require you to be pretty diligent. I will say it was much calmer and more manageable from like 8am-9am. We’ll be back, just not during “peak” times.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: kurt Schroeder⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Nice place for kiddos, especially when weather is unfavorable.

Things to do for all levels. Separate area for little ones, jump pad, 3 playgrounds, racetrack, basketball hoops for all ages, and a ninja course for bigger kids (and husbands). Easy entry with keypad. Just go online, buy your day pass or membership and get the code! If you go twice a month the membership pays for itself. Kids were completely entertained and had a blast while I enjoyed a coffee from the Cafe. Unlike jumpstart and like they say on their website, you are in charge of your kids. There is not staff walking around to enforce rules. Be responsible for your own kids and have a great time. This place is great!!!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ava Nagle⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Honestly quite disappointed. I took my two kiddos (1) and (5) there today. I do think this would be a good place to bring your kids if it was to be actively supervised and not remotely monitored. Leaving it up to parents to watch their own children lead to multiple disturbing instances I saw today. A kid literally laid on top of an infant because her mother was supposed to be watching and didn’t. For this reason alone I won’t be returning as often as I had planned! I truly hope they rethink the idea of having it up to the parents. Also the cafe staff is to sanitize on their down time and doesn’t seem to get down time so I’m a little concerned about everything only getting sanitized once a day at the end. The 3 and under is supposed to have no shoes but nobody is actively monitoring it so parents are wearing outside shoes where infants are playing. Also comparing it to an outside park is not the equivalent because you are to pick up after your self and clean up. I would never leave a place messy or not try to clean something up but to actively advertise clean it up yourself is sort of off putting. I do think the cafe prices seemed very reasonable however I was overcharged due to their system having different prices and had a long wait to get a refund for the difference. The website also says they have IPads to be able to buy tickets and that was false they have no iPads at the entrance. I do think if they had it being attended and changed the price discrepancy in the system, put iPads out like advertised it would be a lot better. However after today I wouldn’t be able to go and have peace of mind that a altercation wouldn’t arise. I also witnessed the owners kiddo running around yelling mom without her nearby that was also a little concerning she wasn’t watching her own child. Going to edit it to one star for the terrible response from the owner.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Joshua Alexander⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: My daughter had an amazing time in all sections of the playground!⏎ ⏎ From the moment we walked in, the space was clean, bright, and incredibly inviting. The variety of activities kept her entertained for hours – from 4 ft to 10 ft basketball hoops, to slides and multiple different types of jungle gyms, to a bounce thing, and a ninja course, there was something for every age group especially including the toddler area.

I am concerned the current style of operation isn’t sustainable long term.⏎ -The website clearly explains pricing, rules and how to buy tickets. Despite this it seemed many people either can’t read or felt entitled to disregard the rules.⏎ - Entry was straightforward (clearly listed in the website)⏎ ⏎ -Pricing is fair and not having to charge adults for admission is a huge pro and draw to take my child here.⏎ ⏎ -I was anticipating a much more put together space that flowed and was professionally installed.(the 3 play scapes and ninja course were professional grade) The execution/construction was somewhat underwhelming for a commercial space,  particularly the floor in the ninja area with gaps and lips/taping that made it easy to trip.⏎ ⏎ -I fear this place will not be sustainable without some staff on site to supervise based on the lack of supervision by many parents. The website and signs clearly state no shoes and everyone must wear socks. Most adults were wearing shoes, but still in all the play areas where children were to be wearing socks. To me this does not make sense. Either everyone should be in socks or everyone should be in shoes.  Although my child had on grippy socks a lot of the equipment is plastic and slippery. The floor on the basketball court is very slick and I witnessed multiple wipe outs.⏎ -There were multiple instances where I witnessed older children rough housing in the 3 and under area which made it unsafe for the toddlers. Examples include climbing on the plastic tree house roof, hanging on the chimney almost ripping it off and jumping off the roof, the door was also ripped off the hinges.⏎ The car/bike area is cool but those toys were getting so abused by children outside the posted age rage slamming them into each other, exceeding size and weight limits and no parents redirecting to be found.⏎ I hope the owners rethink having supervised hours or time blocks to make the experience more enjoyable and safe for all ages and not have all their equipment destroyed in the first week of being open.⏎ I recognize that the responsibility should be on the individual parents to respect the rules in place to keep this a nice and safe space for all to enjoy, but based on what I witnessed today people can’t be left to their own devices.⏎ I hope with a few small improvements and individual people being more respectful of the shared space this business becomes a staple in LaCrosse to be enjoyed by all.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Laurie Bauer⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: The concept of this playground is good. However many older children are running around with no supervision playing in areas that are meant for younger children. It is not a safe situation.  While here, I saw older children slamming the ride toys into other ride toys and the walls. Adults did not take their shoes off and are walking on places where children play on the floor. I saw 7 year olds in the toddler area climbing and standing on the roof of the plastic treehouse with younger children under him. Again, no adult to be seen. The wear and tear on this place is already evident with some doors coming off.⏎ I think this could be a fun place for kids, but I feel that the owners need to spring for paid supervision to keep the equipment and space in good condition and help keep people safe. It should not be a free-for-all. Maybe there should be set playtimes for certain ages.  I’m not sure if I’d bring a toddler back.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Amber Deal⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: I brought my kids and sister ages 12,11 and 1 and all of them had an amazing time and there was something for each of them to do, staff was sanitizing while we were there which made me feel so much better.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

The sensory room is so wonderful for everyone and the party events she hosts are so cute!  She’s so tuned in on what kids enjoy and will switch things up to accommodate.

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit. Overall we had a great experience and the owner played a large part in that.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area.

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

She loved it. The space was big for her and she was able to enjoy everything they had. My daughter crawled everywhere and enjoyed herself until it was time to close. Everything was perfect for babies and I been to few places and haven’t found a place I fell in love with and knew it was perfect for my baby. But this place was perfect for her and age appropriate. I drove 30 mins to go here and it was worth the drive. The owner was super sweet and nice. The environment was calm and perfect for a baby.

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).  We would go back anytime, but on a day when it was 95 degrees outside and you have a little one that wants to go to a playground, this place was a life saver.

And bought a membership for me despite them knowing I had a membership she bought it the second membership. And it was a huge hassle totryy to fix it.⏎ The no food policy is RIDICULOUS. it's all because they got mad that some family had a bday party in their picnic area. Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of ""only snacks"" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks?

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities.

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

I noticed that some children were playing unsupervised, creating unsafe situations. For example, I witnessed a six-month-old child almost getting hurt in the designated baby area due to older children using equipment incorrectly and without appropriate supervision.⏎ ⏎ I appreciate your previous response to my concerns, but it seems that the essential rules aimed at ensuring the safety of all children are not being adequately enforced. It is particularly troubling that enforcement appears to focus primarily on monetary transactions rather than the essential safety regulations that protect our kids.⏎ ⏎ As a concerned patron, I urge you to take immediate action to address these issues. If these safety concerns are not addressed properly, I feel compelled to share my experiences on social media and spread the word about the lack of safety at Good Times Park.⏎ ⏎ Maintaining a safe environment for children should be the highest priority, and I sincerely hope to see improvements that would encourage me to return as a customer in the future.⏎ ⏎ Thank you for your attention to this matter.

It is a place full of colorful swings, slides, and the occasional sound of music playing from a distant vendor’s cart. For most, it is a space of happiness. However, for me, my experience with the Good Times Park has been different. It is a place where I often feel alone, reminded of the harsh realities of my life as an orphan, and of the mean lady who often makes my visits there even more difficult.⏎ ⏎ Being an orphan is not something I ever imagined would define my life. I lost my parents when I was very young, and since then, I have been in and out of foster homes. I never really had a place to call my own. The Good Times Park, with its bright colors and cheerful faces, was one of the few places I hoped to find a sense of belonging. I would often walk through the park, watching the other children with their parents, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of longing deep inside. I wondered what it would be like to have a family that would take me to the park, to share a moment of joy with me.⏎ ⏎ Yet, there is one person who has made it difficult for me to enjoy the park: the lady who is often there. She is an older woman, and her presence seems to cast a shadow over the park’s otherwise sunny atmosphere. She is the park’s caretaker, or at least, that’s what I have gathered. Every time I visit, she seems to be watching me with disdain. She never smiles or greets me like she does with the other children. If I get too close to the swings or the slides, she often scolds me, telling me that I shouldn’t be playing because I don’t belong there. Her words sting, and it is as if the park, a place that should be filled with joy, becomes a reminder of my loneliness.⏎ ⏎ The harshness of her attitude is even more difficult to bear because of the absence of my own family. When I see children laughing and playing with their parents, it reminds me of what I don’t have. I can feel the emptiness, and the lady’s unkindness only deepens that feeling. Her presence feels like an additional weight on my shoulders, as though I am being constantly reminded of my lack of a family and the cruelty that exists in the world.⏎ ⏎ I sometimes wonder why she acts this way toward me. Perhaps it is because I am an orphan, a child without a place to call home, and she sees me as different. But the truth is, her behavior only adds to my sense of isolation. I wish that people like her would understand the pain of being without a family and the importance of kindness. The Good Times Park, which should be a place of joy and healing, often feels like an unwelcoming reminder of my struggles.⏎ ⏎ Despite her mean demeanor, I try to find moments of peace in the park. I sit on the benches, watching the other children play. I try to lose myself in their laughter and the sense of normalcy that surrounds them, but it is never quite the same. My heart aches as I realize that my life will never be like theirs. I have no one to share these moments with, and the cruel lady’s behavior only reinforces that loneliness.⏎ ⏎ However, I still hold on to the hope that someday things will change. Maybe the lady will be kinder, maybe I will find a family, or maybe I will learn to see the park differently. For now, I continue to visit the Good Times Park, though the experiences are bittersweet. The pain of being an orphan and the meanness of the lady linger in my heart, but I still try to find a glimmer of hope and joy in the moments when I can.⏎ ⏎ In conclusion, the Good Times Park is a place filled with contrasts for me. It is a space that should represent happiness and connection, but for me, it often feels like a symbol of my loneliness and pain. The lady, whose coldness hurts more than I can explain, is just one part of the challenge. As an orphan, I long for the simple pleasures that others seem to take for granted.

Unfortunately my visit on December 24th was less than enjoyable.⏎ Owners/Managers need to be a little more hands-on when other guests have zero common sense. A group came in at 9:10am. Three 20 - 30 something men proceeded to run picks with a football in the soccer area. Then they went to the basketball area and the three played basketball for over an hour. It was so dangerous for the little ones that all of the parents and kids had to clear out for their safety. If that wasn't enough,  these three knuckle heads went to the bounce area for several minutes.⏎ Since people have no regard for others,  Good Times needs to step in.⏎ These guys didn't pay to get in because they were with a group and felt they owned the place.⏎ Very frustrating that my 8, 6 and 2 year old couldn't enjoy their day off.⏎ I would have stepped in but these burly dudes were very intimidating and obviously didn't care about others.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Navin D⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: Edited 6 months ago⏎ Review: Not suitable for toddlers. My daughter who is 3 years old felt terrified with bigger kids running around at high speed without noticing who is around. No play area segregation based on the age. There is small area for kids below two years of age but rest of the area is common for all kids until 17 years. Just got my membership and cancelled it right away. Don’t want my kid to be traumatized. Good park employee just sits inside the room and watches the phone and doesn’t care what is happening in the play area. Atleast if the employee can let the bigger kids know not to run and watch out for others that would be great.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Todd Neuman⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lance Davis⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: Kids loved it⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jude Kruse⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: It's got veritable places to a block corner, a children's corner with bump free mats and some small children playground equipment too, they also have a bounce pillow that we do go on but I would say to only go right before they close to go on it if you have small infants.

There is also a large eating area with high chairs which is great!⏎ ⏎ I would love to see a baby/toddler wall seat installed in one of the restroom stalls because it’s hard to use the restroom when you are alone with a crawling baby.

It does get scary sometimes, with some of the older kids kicking the balls too hard, but that’s why you must watch your child the entire time.

The venue was clean and better in person than you can imagine with the pictures (to no fault of the owner). Reasonably priced as well compared to alternatives.

The playground is designed for younger children, and it’s high-quality, safe, and super engaging. There are also a few fun games for kids to play, like basketball and a small selection of arcade games—but what really stands out is how much they focus on getting kids active and moving their bodies, which is so important these days!⏎ ⏎ But the real gem here is the sensory room—we absolutely love it! It’s colorful, interactive, and so thoughtfully designed. My child could spend hours in there exploring and playing. The jump pillow is another favorite—always a huge hit and a great way for kids to burn energy.⏎ ⏎ This spot is perfect for birthday parties, rainy days, snowy days—really anytime you need a fun indoor activity.

Super Clean place, well organized & a friendly-and appreciative owner definitely made our two hour long (round trip) drive worth it!   We work with children so we know exactly what to look for in a setting to maintain safety, child development and encourage free play.  This “Funland” certainly met our expectations.   Age appropriate for crawling infants all the way up to our oldest kiddos- age 13.  (They were well aware to watch out for the “Littles” and they were also able to enjoy themselves)  Having rented the entire space for our “private event” was more than worth the price to have the evening to ourselves.  The party rooms, adult massage chairs work great.  The sensory room is ideal for toddlers & young preschoolers.  The bounce pad alone entertained everyone -of all ages our entire 2 hours.  We all agreed that not only would we come back as individuals but we will host most private events here as the set up was so perfect.  Thanks again for hosting us!

We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).

Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of ""only snacks"" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks?

Tons of stuff to do. Nice that we can bring our own snacks and drinks for picnic area. Nice, clean, accessible bathrooms and hand washing stations. Nice cozy corner. They have one mother's room/changing room with lights that can dim. There are lockers all over for storage and a self-service coat check near the entrance with kid-height hangers.⏎ Only downside is Boundless REQUIRES kids be supervised and then REQUIRE the supervisors pay $3 each. Why not allow one free adult for every 3-4 child admissions? That's my only complaint. The annual memberships do not fix this problem for us as we live an hour away.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Deana Dresen⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Clean and well kept.

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Riggott⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review, Jacob!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Larson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: An amazing play place!

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

We were told we had to leave if we didn't toss the food. It was only later that I noticed a sign that said ""no meals"" posted above the sink. Seems kind of open to interpretation and trivial. We pay $30 a month for a membership and can't bring a sandwich and sippy cup of water into the food area?

I love that there is plenty of space for active play but there is also a quiet sensory room, two ball pits, and dedicated spaces for the littlest guests. It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored. We have been coming here since it opened and one thing that stands out to me is that Kirsten, the owner, is constantly making tweaks and improvements based on feedback. She is incredibly responsive and friendly.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

When we got there it wasn't very crowded and he was able to explore. It did pick up as the day went on but never overcrowded. The facility was very clean and the staff were very friendly. For a children's playplace it is amazingly well maintained. The price was also surprisingly cheaper than expected especially given that there's no time limit. It might be a good idea to update the pictures on Google though as the rock climbing area in a lot of pictures is replaced by a much better crochet climbing zone that's much more accessible and should be advertised. All around a great facility that we will definitely be returning to.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chris Dunk⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 weeks ago⏎ Review: Thank you Chris for the 5 star review!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Shelley Kolaski⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 weeks ago⏎ Review: Family day⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Penny Clore⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: Wx Allentown place fir family and kids to play.

There were teens playing tag while we were there and getting a little rough.  One of the teens knocked into my 3 year old so hard, she flew back about 6 feet.  She also got hit really hard in the face by one of the swings.  I paid the same as everyone else.  She should have been able to play safely.  I had no issues with the teenagers playing in there as long as no one was injured, or they were careful around the smaller ones, but she couldn't even play without getting hurt. There is no supervision in the play area and there needs to be.  I asked them to have someone supervise on the upper levels because there were a lot of younger kids there.  They said they would get someone up there.  They never did.  Another thing that made me nervous was there were so many entry and exit points in the equipment and no security at the door.  My kids could have gone down a slide, had someone grab them, and I wouldn't know until a long time later.  It's sad.  It looked amazing.  There were just some safety issues that needed to be addressed.⏎ ⏎ Edited to add, I visited Deep Blue again and was pleasantly surprised!  They took all of my concerns and fixed them and even went above and beyond!  This place is now absolutely amazing and wonderful for the kids!  I added the 5th star!  They deserve it!

I understand it is a party place for children, but I have never seen so many people under one roof at one time in my life.⏎ The kids complained about how crowded it was.⏎ My main concern was the ""letters"" on the pizza boxes. On each box there was a letter kindly asking that the boxes the pizzas were brought up in were not thrown away!!!! The letter stated that the boxes were reused until they were too greasy to reuse! I asked one of the servers about this and was told, and I quote ""Yes, as disgusting as it is, that is the company policy!""⏎ A 2 hour party cost $500 and they are very precise on that 2 hour mark, they will run you out!

The workers were openly cussing in front of children, which is completely inappropriate and unprofessional. On top of that, they seemed uninterested in doing their jobs and would be very clearly upset when they had to get off of their phones and/or take their AirPods out to assist children on the rock climbing walls. I do understand that the workers are children (teenagers) themselves, but if you do not have the patience to help young children then there is no need to work in an environment geared towards children. If you feel the need to cuss at and roll your eyes at a 6 year old for asking for help all because you have to stop listening to your music for 2 seconds then please find a different job.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Michael Lang⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Kids loved it!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nicolas Edwards⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the 5 stars Nicolas!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Noela Francis⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the 5 stars!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Rosie Castleberry⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: Great indoor place to take the kids to play.

We had our daughters birthday there and they took such great care of us. The owner is the sweetest lady you will ever meet and you can tell how much she loves her business, employees and customers. She's always innovating and updating things to make it better and better. For a kids play place it is super clean. They take cleaning and sanitizing seriously which as a mom I appreciate so much. I never worry about it being dirty or unsafe for my daughter. Also their pizza is made in house and is reasonably priced and yummy.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kelli Powell⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: Edited a year ago⏎ Review: Edit: we came back this summer and they’ve updated the toddler area and allow parents to assist children.  We will be returning!⏎ ⏎ Original: This place has so much potential.  I’m giving it a three because it’s not that it doesn’t accommodate certain ages but it does not accommodate three and under or children on the spectrum.    It’s 95* out and we are on day four of being pent up in our house with a 23 month old.  We thought okay he loves climbing and what better place to climb than a padded play place.  He loved it, absolutely loved it.  It’s convenient for us since we live on the east side of Evansville, and he can get all of his energy out safely.  So why am I giving it a three?  Well because he’s 23 months and there are kids allowed up to 12 to play in the same area as him so I thought okay that’s fine I’ll just help him through it.  Nope, parents only allowed on ground floor.  And that would be okay if there were things on the ground floor for toddlers beside one pirate ship with a single slide and a maze.  The ball pit wasn’t even available today.  Now for those who say okay just keep them on the ground floor, you’ve obviously never had a toddler because trying to keep them from climbing up to the next level for 45 minutes is like wrestling an alligator.  Like seriously?  Just let them watch other kids go but say no to someone who doesn’t understand logic and their favorite thing to do it climb?  Again, I think when he’s older this place will be great if it stays open long enough.  The pirate ship area should have a mini climbing area for three and under.  It could have two levels with a longer slide and places to climb because they like to climb too.  I’ve seen so many reviews about this but no response from the company.  I guess we will just keep making the drive to polka dots for the next two years so he can climb safely without being disappointed.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Teesh Rankin⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Great for kids.

This review is for Logan( really tall, brown hair). I got your name from another employee at the front desk. It is the first day that Warwick county is out for summer vacation. You were working the climbing wall on this particularly busy day. I sat at the table across from the entrance, and saw every interaction with every small child you had today, you were fantastic. You were friendly and encouraging to every single kid. When it came time to switch to the next group, my particularly anxious, seven-year-old could not get his harness off by himself and started to panic. You walked over to him, kneeling down to his level as he was starting to cry. You talk to him kindly, you helped him get his harness off, you helped him keep calm, and even gave him stickers afterwards. I don’t know if you have younger siblings, or cousins but you are fantastic with younger kids. I hope you will be there the next time we come in.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Deborah Roberson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Sammy loves this place so me and him go usually once a week.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

My four year old particularly loves to play on the rock walls, trampoline and foam pit! I am always noticing he gets braver and more adventurous each time we go. Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy. This place is a family favorite!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chelsea Hengeveld⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: This play area is best for kids under 5.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

I love that there is plenty of space for active play but there is also a quiet sensory room, two ball pits, and dedicated spaces for the littlest guests. It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored. We have been coming here since it opened and one thing that stands out to me is that Kirsten, the owner, is constantly making tweaks and improvements based on feedback. She is incredibly responsive and friendly.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

There are constantly employees wiping the structure down, using a Swiffer to clean the floor, and rearranging the toddler space to keep it organized and accessible. I'm not even super concerned about germs, it's just THAT clean! It is $20 for 90 minutes of play. It isn't a cheap excursion, but it is so so worth it!

You can see an inch of dust under the equipment (especially under the slides on the right side), and the dust bunnies are floating around the room. I felt like my eyes were itchy and we didn't stay long because of it.⏎ ⏎ As others pointed out in their reviews, this place STINKS and they need to figure out why. Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.⏎ ⏎ More ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.⏎ ⏎ I'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashlei Kraemer⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Not enough seating but kids of all ages loved it!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jake Kvanbeck⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jamall Dyar⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: My kids love this indoor playground as it definitely provides hours of fun.

There two rooms in side which are  rented out for birthdays parties. The reason why I gave 4 ⭐️ only is because the restrooms should be kept clean and because since there is only one restroom, the lines are very long. Other than that, it’s a great place for kids to release their energy.⏎ When my girls got home, I bathed them and they were asleep literally 5 mins later. I love this place.

Good basic party room which was really nice to have as it was extremely busy. Could bring a cake and water. Price was reasonable for a two hour window and ten wristbands. It's hard to keep an eye on kids the whole time, but having one entry/exit makes it secure at least.

My 2-year old twins love it. They have a gated section for 0-3 yr old to play around and an opened section for big kids. Their are a bunch of crawl spaces, tunnels, and slides to slide down, climb, and move around in. I'm definitely going back, and we will be regular. I believe that during the weekdays, the cost per child is $5.50 toward the end of the day, and the weekend is $8 (supervising adult is free). There are signs that everybody must wear socks for hygiene, safety, and to protect the playground, but because the staff does not monitor carefully, there are some parents who disregard the signs and have a lack of respect and courtesy for the facility guidelines, so you will see them wearing shoes.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mohammed Rahman⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: $8 for my 2.5 year old’s entry and $4 for his socks. The toddler area is not manned at all times so there was an influx of older kids coming in. This raised our concerns for our toddler’s safety so we left early. I hope they implement the “toddler-only” policy in the toddler area strictly. The front desk staffer was understanding and took our feedback well. Thanks.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nate J⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: The park is great! Tons of fun things to do for kids of all ages groups. I can't give it 5 stars because they allow the ""Hover Parents"" to follow their kids thru the tunnels. So while my kid is running around 20 feet in the air, he encounters a 200lb man completely blocking the way... Then he comes back saying, ""There was a big guy, he was scary!"" Seriously, people, let your kids explore on their own. They don't need you on top of them!

I sat and watched one older kid get stuck in the tree and scream for a good minute for his mom because he was stuck in the tree and mom was stuck on her phone. Another parent had to help this kid.

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).  We would go back anytime, but on a day when it was 95 degrees outside and you have a little one that wants to go to a playground, this place was a life saver.

And bought a membership for me despite them knowing I had a membership she bought it the second membership. And it was a huge hassle totryy to fix it.⏎ The no food policy is RIDICULOUS. it's all because they got mad that some family had a bday party in their picnic area. Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of ""only snacks"" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks? Idk The policy is ridiculous. And doesn't make much sense to anyone lol.⏎ ⏎ That being said it's still fun but I wish they'd re-evaluate the rule.

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Riggott⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review, Jacob!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Larson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: An amazing play place!

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

My 2-year old twins love it. They have a gated section for 0-3 yr old to play around and an opened section for big kids. Their are a bunch of crawl spaces, tunnels, and slides to slide down, climb, and move around in. I'm definitely going back, and we will be regular. I believe that during the weekdays, the cost per child is $5.50 toward the end of the day, and the weekend is $8 (supervising adult is free). There are signs that everybody must wear socks for hygiene, safety, and to protect the playground, but because the staff does not monitor carefully, there are some parents who disregard the signs and have a lack of respect and courtesy for the facility guidelines, so you will see them wearing shoes.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mohammed Rahman⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: $8 for my 2.5 year old’s entry and $4 for his socks. The toddler area is not manned at all times so there was an influx of older kids coming in. This raised our concerns for our toddler’s safety so we left early.

I can't give it 5 stars because they allow the ""Hover Parents"" to follow their kids thru the tunnels. So while my kid is running around 20 feet in the air, he encounters a 200lb man completely blocking the way... Then he comes back saying, ""There was a big guy, he was scary!""

They had an Easter event going on which was super cute, eggs and an employee was dressed up as the Easter bunny having fun with the kids.⏎ ⏎ Why I gave it 1 star?⏎ - Lack of cleanliness. This place needs to be deep cleaned and then continued to be deep cleaned on a weekly basis. There was long black/brown hair everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE. All over in the ball pit area.. stuck to balls.. stuck even in some of the toys up in the air. Just gross. Even areas of the toys like the vanity area… the surfaces were visibly dirty with little kid boogers/finger prints. We got there right as they opened so this was not from the day we were there and the traffic of that day. Super disappointing… my child is in daycare so I’m not a germ freak, but this totally creeped me out.⏎ ⏎ - Upkeep of the toys just isn’t being done or even upkeep at the place. Lots of toys broken and taped back together. The door seal on the back door in the block area is ripped out of the door just hanging there.. toys are broken and taped back together or just broken/missing pieces. I get that with places like this that happens, but I used to frequent Curious Kids Museum in Saint Joe, MI and never have noticed anything in the condition of this place⏎ ⏎ - There just really isn’t that much to do, it’s pretty small in all honesty…⏎ ⏎ - The slides are dangerous. Like really dangerous. Even for older kids. Right when we got there two smaller kids went down the green slides and both smacked their heads at the bottom and ended up in full blown tears. My daughter is a scaredy cat so that was enough for her to not be interested in trying… which thank goodness because I didn’t want her going down them. Honestly not many kids use these slides I think because of this.. I watched a few other kids go down and experience a similar experience and not return to them.. there is one other slide that is much better, but still super slippery so you have to be careful⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: thang nguyen⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Do yo have open Sunday esterday⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Laura Penner⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Awesome place!

It was a little chaotic as we got there at open, the check in area is really small and when everyone is trying to take off shoes/ coats and check in at the same time it’s a little overwhelming. It was a tad concerning that there was no kind of stamp/ verification for children arriving with a caregiver to make sure nobody leaves with someone else’s kid. There are a lot of small nooks and crannies that my daughter loved but it was kind of hard as a parent to keep track of her through the winding equipment. My only other concern was I brought my 3 month old along too and there was nowhere comfortable to  breastfeed. I sat in a corner near the one bathroom. It was a little strange for a place that is for children, there is no real comfortable place for a mom to breastfeed. I still give four stars because my daughter had an absolute blast and we will be back.

When you compare to other children’s activities in the area (play cafe, children’s museum, etc) this is double the price.

The price for a birthday party for the amount of hours and other perks you get compared to other places is unbeatable. They even had complimentary popcorn! The owners were so nice and real down to earth people and were great with communication during the whole process. They partner with the local Hungry Howie's for a pizza deal with the party. There was even a mix up between hungry Howie's and us with paper plates and the owners of Kidz Indoor playground went to the dollar store and got some because it was faster than waiting for hungry Howie's. Such a kind thing of them. Will be going back!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Brooklyn Daniel⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: I booked my daughter’s birthday here. They helped me with invitations, a backdrop/balloons, and 2 tables and 6 chairs in total. Over the place itself was nice but if you plan on having a party larger than 25 people, kids included I wouldn’t recommend this place. OVERLY priced! We got the ‘Silver package which is the $400 one, and in total ended up paying well over $700. I have to pay for the kids to get socks, which l thought was included in the price, extra chairs, and pizza. I also had to pay for the extra kids (3) since they only allow 10 for that package. Also, they kept bugging us stuff they didn’t make clear in the beginning. THEN while we're having our birthday party, they were sending over strangers to come check out the room like it was a showcase room or something. Overall 2/10 wouldn’t recommend. The only good thing was the backdrop/balloon set up.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Philena Patterson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: I took my little cousin here for the first time, what attracted us was the open globe she just started gymnastics and wanted to climb on it to practice the stuff she was learning, I think it was really awesome they had a tot lot, which is a section for 3yrs and under, they had a few different bounce houses for various ages, as well as Lego’s, magnets, scooters, toy trucks to ride, it was just a blast and they also have power hour which is 50% off if you come the last hour of the session time! The price was already a good deal for the time, without it though! We went on a Friday and it was just the right amount of energy, kids, and activities it wasn’t packed but there were other kids for my cousin to have a couple play mates. The owner seemed really nice and was very involved and interacting as her daughter was there as well playing amongst the kiddos!!!They also have kid friendly bathrooms, drinking fountain, popcorn machine, for fresh popcorn, cookies, chips, and all types of snacks to keep the kids energetic until dinner time!!!!

I do think the cost for one day is a bit on the higher side when compared to other comparable play places in the Twin Cities; however, The admission ticket gets you all day, which is a big difference from most places that limit your admission to two hours. When looking at the pricing online, it would seem that the monthly membership is well worth the cost. There is also no admission fee for the adults, which is quite nice in comparison to some of the other places!⏎ ⏎ The play structures are very clean and well maintained. I loved how much seating there was for the adults. You could tell that a lot of thought was put into this place to provide comfort and convenience in all aspects. I really liked that compared to other play places there were less small toys. I find in some of the other places, the small toys create a huge tripping mass very quickly. I thought the emphasis on play structures was super nice, it almost seemed like an OT built the place. My kids had a wonderful time and have been asking daily to go back! We will be definitely purchasing a membership for the upcoming fall and winter!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Amber⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: I have lived in Shakopee for 4 years.

My two year old had a blast when we were there, he didn’t want to leave! So nice to have an indoor play area for kids in Carver County! The space was clean, as were the toys and climbing areas. And it was nice and open, so you could have view of your child from almost anywhere in the space. The only suggestion I would have, with winter coming up, is more coatracks for coats.

I had high hopes for this place, but it was a complete letdown. It’s overpriced and even worse, the customer service is just awful. The owner Heather is shockingly unprofessional and clearly doesn’t understand how to run a business. After I professionally requested a refund (for a 2nd time) instead of a credit via email after a misunderstanding she said I was rude and ‘never allowed back’? It was so strange. Not like I wanted to go back anyway after the struggle it was to be refunded, but it’s clear they care more about taking people’s money than providing a quality experience and doing the right thing without getting defensive.⏎ There are far better places that actually value their customers. I hope Heather responds on here as dramatic as she was in her emails, and learns from this experience to treat customers better.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Clare Barnes⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: K S⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Veronica Roberts⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Very clean and my kids had a great time!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Justine Tolentino (Justine Mcintosh)⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: We LOVE Play Date.

The climbing equipment is the perfect size for younger kids, and there is often something new added or changed (the playhouse with various themes is a favorite).

It is fairly clean for the traffic it sees. No staff on site to periodically sanitize mouthed toys or pick up, and the water fountain is pretty gross. Saw a caretaker change a diaper on the carpeted play area.

The place just feels very warm (welcoming) and clean (including restrooms and well apportioned baby changing areas), and my kids didn't want to leave after 2 hours.  We were there from 3pm for a few hours and there were a max of four families at busiest.  The entry is very easy.⏎ I'd say it was high value for the money spent, and while there are cheaper options, my happiness level was higher and stress lower here than at a community center or large, grimy indoor playground.  Well done to this small, local business!⏎ Would recommend all adults and kids alike wear good socks.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tasha Hennen⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: Edited 6 months ago⏎ Review: This is a nice place to bring your young one to get out of the house on cold or hot days.

Great space to let the littles (I'd say age 5 is pushing it) play while parents chat. There are little nuances to the space that could be fixed up/changed to get 5 stars. The imaginarium train table tracks have been glued down to the table totally defeating the purpose of imaginary and creative play. Some pieces have been ripped off, making some unusable as well as ripping up the table. The hand dryer in the restroom does not work, i had to scurry around and check out the changing station where I was lucky to find paper towels. I would go again, just with lower expectations.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kathleen Staska⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Hi.

I love that there is plenty of space for active play but there is also a quiet sensory room, two ball pits, and dedicated spaces for the littlest guests. It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored. We have been coming here since it opened and one thing that stands out to me is that Kirsten, the owner, is constantly making tweaks and improvements based on feedback. She is incredibly responsive and friendly.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

It's always clean and a safe place for kids. The app is super easy to use. It's great for your younger children. It hasn't been overcrowded any time I've been there. You can bring your own snacks, but they have to be left outside the play area itself. There are areas for that.

I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

For 15 bucks per child, I had mediocre expectations, which were absolutely not met. The entire place was absolutely disgusting and filthy. I took my daughter to the bathroom, and before we could see that the toilet had overflowed, my daughter walked into the toilet water on the floor. Luckily, I had a spare pair of socks  but we had to throw the ones we came in with away. When we sought out another bathroom to get cleaned up, it was out of the basics, no soap and dirty. Just to have one person on staff to do these basic tasks would be the minimum expectation for a place of this size. You can tell there is little pride in the space and the people have given up on maintenance and are just there to take your money.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Brittany Misuraca⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: We came for a birthday party.

Another reviewer mentioned the coffee beans spilled under the big chess pieces four months ago.  The coffee beans are still there under the mats.  The crane game by the entrance doesn't work, it just takes your money.  This place needs to be shut down for a month to patch and paint the drywall, do a serious deep clean, and make sure everything in here is in safe working order.

Our infant had fun crawling around on the green turf but there was a lot of small garbage on the ground from confetti pieces to bottle caps. I picked up and threw away what I saw. I'm not sure how often they clean the facility but it was dirty. Could use drywall patching and paint. There are things written on the walls along with big holes. There are cameras around the building so if there isn't anyone here maintaining it, then they should watch every once in awhile to see who's damaging things or misusing items... which is unfortunate when parents should be responsible. Some parents and their kids went barefooted as well, which is gross and not hygienic. They didn't seem to care about the rules when told. That's also a health hazard. The hand painted graphics are fun.  There's a little game area. A lot of tables to sit at. Not bad for an indoor play area but dirty with lazy upkeep and enforcement.

They always have a blast, but this time was the first time I’ve seriously considered not returning given the cleanliness and safety concerns. There were some holes in the drywall exposing wiring that young children could easily pull out. These were in high traffic and highly visible areas. In addition, the play areas seemed extremely dirty. The floors in the age 2 to 5 playground area were especially gross. Dust, food remnants and who knows what were visibly evident. We were there about two hours, and I observed one person cleaning the tables and eating areas, but the play areas seem totally neglected and not kept up. Part of this is on the part of parents of especially older children who tend to run wild and misuse equipment. Nevertheless, I don’t think we’ll be back, which is a shame, considering we’ve enjoyed this facility a number of times over the past decade. For less money, you can have a better experience at Avery’s Adventures in Elk River for younger kiddos.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Craig Thingvold⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jo Cross⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Loved it great birthday place for kids so much fun⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Erin Baldridge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Love this place, great for birthday parties and getting out of the house.

Well, it's just going to happen.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: kayla engen⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Gretchen Bohm⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Came here for a kiss birthday party.

You would think in a post-Covid world, we would be doing better with public health and cleanliness of shared public spaces, especially for kids.⏎ ⏎ The bathrooms were foul smelling, the turf area smelled of urine, i saw saliva on one of the toys, etc. before we even left my son started to have a runny nose and now has a full blown cold. The vibe is kind of like nobody really cares about this place, they just care about making money with minimal effort.⏎ ⏎ My suggestion would be to limit the number of families who can be in the space at one time, and have families sign up for a 2 hour slot with breaks in between for cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing. Eg 9-11 slot, 11-1 clean, 1-3 slot. I would be willing to pay more knowing my son is going to a clean environment.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Destiny Hurley⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Had a lot of fun with the grand babies here.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

I love bringing my grandbabies here, they love it! They both are generally healthy, until I take them here which is getting to be less and less now. This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy. This place is a family favorite!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chelsea Hengeveld⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: This play area is best for kids under 5.

I love bringing my grandbabies here, they love it! They both are generally healthy, until I take them here which is getting to be less and less now. This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

My four year old particularly loves to play on the rock walls, trampoline and foam pit! I am always noticing he gets braver and more adventurous each time we go. Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy. This place is a family favorite!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chelsea Hengeveld⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: This play area is best for kids under 5.

I love bringing my grandbabies here, they love it! They both are generally healthy, until I take them here which is getting to be less and less now. This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

Upon arrival, everything was greatly organized, clean, and very well decorated. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. If we needed waters, plates, anything at all, they were on top of it. The place was very clean with so many different activities for kids to do. When mickey mouse came out all of the kids with the party were ecstatic. Mickey mouse played with all the kids, and spent most of the time, while there, with the birthday boy. It was such a fantastic experience and would recommend to anyone with young kids to support this wonderful place. Thank you all for the amazing experience!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Justin Ryder⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: This was a great play place!  Very clean!

Jodi and her team are AMAZING!! I wouldn’t look anywhere else to have your child’s birthday. This is PERFECT! We had our daughter’s 5th birthday here and were beyond surprised and thankful for the level of service. Herself and team went above and beyond to make her  birthday the best it can be. Everything promised in booking was delivered X10. Anything you can think of⏎ that comes with birthday’s ( decorations, goodie bags, set up, take down, character meetings,..or forget candles like myself) she has it covered. And you can’t argue with the price, honestly.

The price is for all day and you can come and go as you please for that one admission fee. There are a few arcade machines and fun ride ons available for credits called “flames”. We bought 50 flames for $10, which my kids mostly used for the ride ons. It’s only 5 flames per ride.

The birthday party meal package that we went with included pizza, cake, beverages, decorations, credits for games/rides, and goody bags. You're able to bring in outside food with the party so we brought a few snacks and sparkling waters for the adults. We (and our guests) were so impressed with the cleanliness and quality of the facility. The play structure is completely enclosed (so no intrepid explorers can make their way out of the play area) and can fully accommodate adults so the parents can get in to help kids when needed (or just to join in the fun). There is another play structure for smaller kids (toddlers in diapers and under) so there was something fun for all ages.⏎ ⏎ We chose a 10:30am slot on a Saturday and it was great for our ages 2-5. It wasn't too busy (started getting pretty packed by the time we left at 2:30pm) and the majority of kids in the structure were around that age. I felt safe letting my 3 and 5 year olds run free with less supervision.⏎ ⏎ The thing that really stood out was the professionalism and attention to detail of the events team that handled our party! They took care of everything and made sure we were having a great time. I highly recommend this place for birthday parties and we'll definitely be back on another day just to have hours of fun climbing, running, and playing in this awesome place!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nat⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Staff is lovely!

It was the first day of Spring Break and EID. Management needs to plan better staffing-wise around school breaks and holidays.⏎ ⏎ A little while into our visit, the male staff found two young kids but could not find their adult. He carried them both around, trying to find their adult. There has to be a better way for staff to locate parents than this. With how chaotic it was, he could have easily tripped while carrying both of these kids and they all would have gotten hurt. Mom was eventually found, and all seemed well.⏎ ⏎ A little boy hurt himself pretty badly (gash on his head, absolutely needed stitches). Thankfully, I had napkins at my table and was able to apply pressure while my husband told the staff to get the first aid kit, and the child's parents were found. About 30 minutes after the family had left, there was still blood on the floor next to my table. I walked to the counter (noticed a bloody gauze pad on the floor on the way) to let the female employee know about the blood on the floor and the gauze pad, and her response was less than desired.

My 2 year old son slipped, even with grippy socks,  and hit his head very hard and threw up shortly afterwards. My sister went to get an icepack and the staff gave us one that was supposed to become cold after cracking it, but the icepack never got cold. Then we found out the staff called an ambulance without seeing what happened or talking to us first. When we asked for help directly they chastised us for not having left already. Absurd and incredibly unprofessional behavior. It was all very strange and an avoidable situation. There was only one person working at the front when we came and the play area was completely unsupervised. I also agree with all the other comments. Overpriced, system was strange, was not very clean, and UNSAFE. We did take our son to the hospital and thankfully he was fine.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jesi Sola Konz⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: I would give this place zero stars if I could, the worst thing is the insecurity and danger, they have a room with dim lights and the floor is very slippery, my son slipped and hit his head. The staff didn't ask us parents anything, a few minutes later my son vomited, we think it was because of the blow, the staff came to say they didn't want to be rude but what were we doing? I was changing diapers and getting my son ready to go to the emergency room. Without asking us, she called an ambulance, we wanted to buy socks because my son soiled his with vomit, the socks they sell are not safe and have no grip, how is that possible in a place that specializes in children? That alone I recommend not going, but it is also very expensive for what they offer, you cannot bring drinks or food and you can only consume what they sell. We will never go back to a place like this.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ubeyti Jara⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Very amazing.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: U2llIGlzdA RGVyIEhhdXB0YmF1ZXIK⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Cute and simple.

It is so great that you get two adults free per kid.  And you can come and go throughout the day without having to pay more than once.  We went this past Friday and the place is still very clean, temperature controlled, bright and well cared for.  The one employee who was working the front noticed my nephew was crying and came over to see if he was okay because he had accidentally got kicked in the eye while on the ""spider web"" tower and asked if he wanted a sucker and an ice pack.  Only thing I wish they did have is wipes in the changing table to use to wipe the changing table.  The concessions stand is reasonable and the arcade card you can get is great ($20 for 100 points).  The kiddos love the bikes they can self drive.  I'm so grateful that this place opened in our neighborhood and is open throughout the year especially during the winter.

The management of the people at the park is non-existent. Multiple times that we have been to this park, the equipment has been taken over by people looking 18+ years old. The equipment is designed for younger kids up to middle school, so people adult‐size make the park cramped and unsafe for children to play. The employees ignore any of this going on and let everything be free roam. Our younger child was almost crushed under a 6'2 probably 200+ pound person that jumped down the strap climbing area without looking at the 4-6 year olds climbing from the bottom. The soccer area which is about 20 feet by 30 feet in size was taken over by about 15+ of these adults that were wrestling and pushing each other and small children out of the way. There should be restrictions enforced for safety in a play area of this size, but there aren't any. This crowd shows up regularly as well as they have been there almost every time I've visited. My kids love the park but it feels too unsafe to bring them again after the incidents in our last visit.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Devan King⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Dianne Andrews⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Faith Sanders⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: My daughter absolutely loved this place.

And the guilt associated when you are finding this out when you are standing there with your child or your grandchildren and you have to tell them because of how incredibly expensive it is that you will not be able to play there is incredible! - it almost seems like that guilt is counted on as it is really tough to tell your kids or grandkids that we have to go because you did not budget for the (shocking) amount  of money it costs to play there. That said,  if cost is not an issue for you, it looks like the place can be fun for the kids or Grandkids. **NOTE** We did not play there because of the high cost of admission - we found that Chutes and Ladders - also in Bloomington - is free and although it is outdoors, the Grandkidos had a terrific time and is one of their favorite places to play. Mind you, it is not a daycare, so a parent, grandparent etc. is best to stay and play for the safest, fun time!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ayantu Backup⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: my little ones got very sick after our last visit.

A day pass is a bit pricy especially if you are just there for a little bit, but if you lived nearby it seems like a great place to let your toddler burn energy with a monthly pass.

My baby learned how to climb & go down slides & my toddlers found a new love for swinging/spinning (egg swing is what we called it).⏎ ⏎ If you're looking for a safe space for your kiddos to play where parents are tentative to their children, this is it. We didn't have to worry about any unsupervised kids. Door is heavy enough to where if a kiddo did run off, they wouldn't be able to exit. & the place isn't big to where you feel overwhelmed. You can see your child from any location in the room.⏎ ⏎ The place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well, no odors or messes. Bonus points for the rubber flooring that makes falls easier to handle. & the couches placed throughout so parents have somewhere to sit. Offially our favorite local indoor place for the littles.

I'd recommend this for ages 3 and under. It's designed for parents who also have an infant to care for, as there a whole corner just for tinies that includes a rocking/nursing chair!! There's a little area for crawlers so that they don't get trampled. There are FOUR big, comfy couches around for the adults, flooring is totally padded except for the kitchen area. THEY STOCK THE BATHROOMS WITH DIAPERS AND WIPES. That's unheard of. Decent vending machine, sink, coffee machine, drinking fountains, cubbies for shoes and coats. $14 for one kid, good for the whole day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Кайрат Бейсенбаев⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: The best place I've been!!!!👍👍👍 …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lisa Miller⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: ak⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Amazing soft play playground for toddlers!

Nice atmosphere for moms also; you can choose to socialize or to do your own thing. You are able to bring in food or buy their snacks and drinks which can be convenient. There were only two tables so when both were occupied with other parents working/reading, or storing their food and stuff, we unfortunately resorted to sitting on the floor to eat until a table opened up.

Fun idea but I think more thought should have gone into it. Very haphazard.  Way too expensive.  Lights were off and we couldn’t figure out where the switch was.  Lots of dangerous things such as the back door could very easily be opened, no bumpers on doors for finger protection, the metal grates in the doors are sharp and fingers could get stuck in them.

We took our 2-year old for the first time on Sunday and he had a phenomenal time playing on all of the different equipment. There were about 10 families in the playground at the same time. We all had a lot of room to spread out and more than enough toys to play with. The honeycomb slide is a personal favorite for our son. He had a ton of fun climbing through each area up and down.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Katelyn L⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: $14 for a child to go in.

It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored.

We drove all the way down from Minneapolis. We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Deseree Edholm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo's is not only my daughter's favorite play cafè, but as a stay at home mom, this is by far the best play cafè out there!

For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy.

When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit. Overall we had a great experience and the owner played a large part in that.

A day pass is a bit pricy especially if you are just there for a little bit, but if you lived nearby it seems like a great place to let your toddler burn energy with a monthly pass. Parking can be hard depending on the time / day of the week since the lot is small and there are many businesses in the same building.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: K Nichole⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Came in today w my 1 yr old & 3 y/o twins for something to do in the -temps. We had a blast. My baby learned how to climb & go down slides & my toddlers found a new love for swinging/spinning (egg swing is what we called it).⏎ ⏎ If you're looking for a safe space for your kiddos to play where parents are tentative to their children, this is it. We didn't have to worry about any unsupervised kids. Door is heavy enough to where if a kiddo did run off, they wouldn't be able to exit. & the place isn't big to where you feel overwhelmed. You can see your child from any location in the room.⏎ ⏎ The place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well, no odors or messes. Bonus points for the rubber flooring that makes falls easier to handle. & the couches placed throughout so parents have somewhere to sit. Offially our favorite local indoor place for the littles. Safe. Fun. Friendly.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Dana Henriksen⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: This place is amazing for toddlers!

I'd recommend this for ages 3 and under. It's designed for parents who also have an infant to care for, as there a whole corner just for tinies that includes a rocking/nursing chair!! There's a little area for crawlers so that they don't get trampled. There are FOUR big, comfy couches around for the adults, flooring is totally padded except for the kitchen area. THEY STOCK THE BATHROOMS WITH DIAPERS AND WIPES. That's unheard of. Decent vending machine, sink, coffee machine, drinking fountains, cubbies for shoes and coats. $14 for one kid, good for the whole day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Кайрат Бейсенбаев⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: The best place I've been!!!!👍👍👍 …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lisa Miller⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: ak⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Amazing soft play playground for toddlers!

Nice atmosphere for moms also; you can choose to socialize or to do your own thing. You are able to bring in food or buy their snacks and drinks which can be convenient.

A day pass is a bit pricy especially if you are just there for a little bit, but if you lived nearby it seems like a great place to let your toddler burn energy with a monthly pass. Parking can be hard depending on the time / day of the week since the lot is small and there are many businesses in the same building.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: K Nichole⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Came in today w my 1 yr old & 3 y/o twins for something to do in the -temps. We had a blast. My baby learned how to climb & go down slides & my toddlers found a new love for swinging/spinning (egg swing is what we called it).⏎ ⏎ If you're looking for a safe space for your kiddos to play where parents are tentative to their children, this is it. We didn't have to worry about any unsupervised kids. Door is heavy enough to where if a kiddo did run off, they wouldn't be able to exit. & the place isn't big to where you feel overwhelmed. You can see your child from any location in the room.⏎ ⏎ The place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well, no odors or messes. Bonus points for the rubber flooring that makes falls easier to handle. & the couches placed throughout so parents have somewhere to sit. Offially our favorite local indoor place for the littles. Safe. Fun. Friendly.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Dana Henriksen⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: This place is amazing for toddlers!

I'd recommend this for ages 3 and under. It's designed for parents who also have an infant to care for, as there a whole corner just for tinies that includes a rocking/nursing chair!! There's a little area for crawlers so that they don't get trampled. There are FOUR big, comfy couches around for the adults, flooring is totally padded except for the kitchen area. THEY STOCK THE BATHROOMS WITH DIAPERS AND WIPES. That's unheard of. Decent vending machine, sink, coffee machine, drinking fountains, cubbies for shoes and coats. $14 for one kid, good for the whole day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Кайрат Бейсенбаев⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: The best place I've been!!!!👍👍👍 …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lisa Miller⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: ak⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Amazing soft play playground for toddlers!

Nice atmosphere for moms also; you can choose to socialize or to do your own thing. You are able to bring in food or buy their snacks and drinks which can be convenient.

Unfortunately, when we went back today, it has visibly gone downhill. Several things are being held together with tape, and there were tons of broken ball pit balls, making me wonder how often they clean the ball pit. Some of that comes with the rough play and wear and tear. However, the white floors by the food and games area were so sticky. I could see gunk and smashed candy all over. There were hundreds of ants in the women's bathroom. Went we went potty again before leaving, it appeared someone had mopped. But that just meant there were now dead ants all over, and the sticky stuff they were eating was still there. My kids had a blast, but as a parent, I definitely have reservations about returning if things aren't going to be maintained and adequately cleaned.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Zach M⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: a week ago⏎ Review: Place was well upkept when they first opened, but the upkeeping has gone downhill.

Very unsafe set-up!  It's also very expensive!  24 per child, 18 per toddler, plus 3.50 per socks that are required per child.  There are no membership options unless you get the 150 summer deal.

Now was it fun for the kids yes. However the bathrooms were gross even my little toddler said that's nasty. It was Saturday and it was super crowded. So I would say maybe they were under-staffed. There are some things they need to take notes on like the swinging wrecking ball for instance. It is a complete safety hazard because there is a string attached to it so you can pull it back in easier but that thing is a hazard. A child can easily get tangled up in it and again there is no attendant making sure it doesn't happen. Now let's go to slide with the tubes. There is an attendant here but only at the top to spray the bottoms with water. There isn't an attendant at the bottom to pass out the tubes so whoever came down the slide can just keep the same tube and keep riding even if it's a line. Also the heat was still on even though it was an extremely warm day. You would think the AC would be on to try and keep down some of the germs. Everyone playing were a sweaty mess. I didn't even play and ending up sweating a bit due to the crowd and heat. This place was too chaotic for my taste as a mom with a small kid. It's ok for older kids but the two shouldn't be mixed at all. The ball pit was overrun with older kids knocking the smaller ones over. Maybe if they hire more workers things would run a lot smoother. I don't think I'll be back though my anxiety can't take it.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nevaeh Goins⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: The floors are dirty the staff were rude⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Relle G⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: We spent 8 hrs there and it was morning but fun fun fun!!! 😁😁 …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Satadru Pramanik⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: A fun place, but the ventilation could be a lot better. 😐 …⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nichcole McKindles⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Came on a Saturday - expected busy obviously.

We also loved that it was private and the whole place was ours for 2 hours- worked great for our son who is very shy with strangers, so he was really able to open up with just friends and family there.

We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to host a party!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Borrell⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: We had our daughter’s first birthday party here. The owner, Amanda, was great with communication before, during, and after. The play area is adorable and has tons of fun things for kids of all ages to enjoy. We had kids between 1-7 and all had a fantastic time. We forgot plates, forks, and napkins (oops!) and Amanda graciously provided them. She also got our daughter a present!

You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

Our 1 year old was in need of a fun stop to play and this place was perfect. Really enjoyed my drink, which I could sip while watching him play in a safe, fun enclosed space. I noticed they took extra care to make sure it was “childproof” even putting electrical covers on behind furniture. My only complaint is that I wish there was a play cafe just like this near my house!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Keli Schilling⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christina Green⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: We absolutely love this place!

Kirsten (the owner) is one in a million who is beyond kind and loving towards anyone who walks into her space. She lights up so many children's lives, including my daughter, and moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, nanny's, etc.!! She always takes the time to make sure everything is going well and willing to help anywhere she can.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

I do think the cost for one day is a bit on the higher side when compared to other comparable play places in the Twin Cities; however, The admission ticket gets you all day, which is a big difference from most places that limit your admission to two hours. When looking at the pricing online, it would seem that the monthly membership is well worth the cost. There is also no admission fee for the adults, which is quite nice in comparison to some of the other places!⏎ ⏎ The play structures are very clean and well maintained. I loved how much seating there was for the adults. You could tell that a lot of thought was put into this place to provide comfort and convenience in all aspects. I really liked that compared to other play places there were less small toys. I find in some of the other places, the small toys create a huge tripping mass very quickly. I thought the emphasis on play structures was super nice, it almost seemed like an OT built the place. My kids had a wonderful time and have been asking daily to go back!

After I professionally requested a refund (for a 2nd time) instead of a credit via email after a misunderstanding she said I was rude and ‘never allowed back’? It was so strange. Not like I wanted to go back anyway after the struggle it was to be refunded, but it’s clear they care more about taking people’s money than providing a quality experience and doing the right thing without getting defensive.⏎ There are far better places that actually value their customers. I hope Heather responds on here as dramatic as she was in her emails, and learns from this experience to treat customers better.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Clare Barnes⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: K S⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Veronica Roberts⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Very clean and my kids had a great time!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Justine Tolentino (Justine Mcintosh)⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: We LOVE Play Date.

The climbing equipment is the perfect size for younger kids, and there is often something new added or changed (the playhouse with various themes is a favorite).

It is fairly clean for the traffic it sees. No staff on site to periodically sanitize mouthed toys or pick up, and the water fountain is pretty gross. Saw a caretaker change a diaper on the carpeted play area.

We were there from 3pm for a few hours and there were a max of four families at busiest.  The entry is very easy.⏎ I'd say it was high value for the money spent, and while there are cheaper options, my happiness level was higher and stress lower here than at a community center or large, grimy indoor playground.

Great space to let the littles (I'd say age 5 is pushing it) play while parents chat. There are little nuances to the space that could be fixed up/changed to get 5 stars. The imaginarium train table tracks have been glued down to the table totally defeating the purpose of imaginary and creative play. Some pieces have been ripped off, making some unusable as well as ripping up the table. The hand dryer in the restroom does not work, i had to scurry around and check out the changing station where I was lucky to find paper towels. I would go again, just with lower expectations.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kathleen Staska⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Hi.

Would definitely go back!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: shauna cowden⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Amazing place!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Trisha Rowen⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Went here to celebrate my sons bday recently.

A must !⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Holly Cates⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 4 weeks ago⏎ Review: I recently attended a birthday party of a friend.  When entering with my children, I was told by the owner that I would not be allowed to enter the party area because of my “situation”-meaning I’m a wheelchair user.   He stated that when it came time to sing happy birthday, he’d have the group come to the front area.   He stated that my wheelchair posed a danger to the children in the play area.  My manual wheelchair was a concern for him due to liability and  the possibility of children running into me.  I explained that the room was about 8 feet away.   He suggested I could possibly enter through the back door. I then suggested I would be willing to crawl to the area if it made him more comfortable.  He declined with an eye roll.⏎ ⏎ I suggested that he could escort me to the party room if it made him feel more comfortable but I would not be uprooting an entire party because he was, in my opinion, displaying discriminatory practices due to not understanding how individuals use their mobility devices and most of the children in the facility knew me.⏎ ⏎ Needless to say he made a huge production of “clearing a path” for me to be escorted into the party room.  And did It again when it was time for me to leave.  I was told that I was NOT allowed to leave the party room.  I was unable to watch my children play.   My youngest got hurt in the equipment  (shockingly not by my wheelchair) and  she had to come to the party room (where I was) for assistance.⏎ ⏎ This is not equal access.  This was not treating anyone with dignity.  He stated flatly that he was being reasonable and trying to protect the children.  I assure you, I’m not large.  I’m not quick.  And I work with children daily.  I am not a danger to children.⏎ ⏎ This was a humiliating experience.  I will never go back again.   If you are a wheelchair user, please know…you will not be allowed into the play area without him escorting you and thats only to a designated area only.    I’m not even sure if children with mobility devices will be allowed into the facilities.⏎ ⏎ Such a shame.  It was an adorable facility.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christopher Cates⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 4 weeks ago⏎ Review: They say they are wheelchair assessable but they are not. The owner doesn’t adhere to ADA and is rude and prejudice to people with disabilities. Treating people who are fully functioning adults that navigate society on a daily basis as less than does not reflect well on you as a person or your business. You might as well put a sign on the door that says “Disabled not welcome”. You can’t treat people as if they aren’t welcome because you are ignorant to their abilities. You also don’t need to clear a path for people in a wheelchair and make a big production about it. They get around fine all day without people clearing the way for them. Shameful, disturbing behavior.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Andres Short⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: You want to relax in a clean place while your kids are having fun this is the place you want to go.

It was our first experience renting a place all to ourselves and letting someone else take care of the decoration. We were surprised that what we had asked for was what they did for us (we even added an extra hour to our reservation). Shout out to Corey for making it happen!! We absolutely loved doing our party here and hopefully in the future we get to do another one. We even had a piñata and were allowed to bring the food of our preference. Thank you Corey and Jungle Castle staff for making my daughter’s birthday one to remember.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Wheyder Villasmil⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: An incredible experience for the whole family! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟⏎ ⏎ Celebrate my son's 4th birthday and This playground is, without a doubt, a wonderful place to enjoy with the little ones.

The kids had an absolute blast, and the entire experience was fun-filled from start to finish. A huge shoutout to Austin and Teagan for going above and beyond to entertain our guests – they made the party extra special. The highlight of the event was definitely the bubble party, which had the kids mesmerized! Also, a special moment was Austin trying Scotch eggs, a traditional Cameroonian snack, which made for a fun and memorable interaction.

From the moment I booked a few weeks in advance, Corey, the owner, was incredibly helpful and professional, making the entire process smooth and stress-free.⏎ ⏎ One of the things I appreciated most was that booking a party reserves the entire facility exclusively for your private event—no worrying about overcrowding or unexpected guests. I also loved that Jungle Castle updates their Google hours to show ""Closed"" during private parties to prevent the public from walking in for free play. That level of organization and respect for private events is something you don’t see everywhere!⏎ ⏎ When I sent my birthday theme, I was amazed at how perfectly they decorated everything down to the last detail! They even provided a beautiful cake stand, making it so much easier for me. I didn’t have to stress about decorating or ordering anything other than our cake, which was a huge relief!⏎ ⏎ Our main hostess, Teagan, was phenomenal! She was not only attentive and professional, but I could tell she genuinely loves kids and what she does. She made me feel supported and heard throughout the entire party, ensuring everything ran smoothly and that my little one was having the best time.⏎ ⏎ Since my son is still so small, having a safe, age-appropriate play space was incredibly important to me. The setup at Jungle Castle is perfect for little ones—no worrying about bigger kids running over him or unsafe play areas. It gave me such peace of mind knowing he could explore and play freely without any risks.⏎ ⏎ Overall, Jungle Castle exceeded my expectations in every way! Whether you’re looking for a fun place for free play or planning a private event, I HIGHLY recommend them! We will definitely be back! 💙🎉🎂⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jennifer Roden⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Came by during vacation to the DFW area. The facility was very clean.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).

My mom tried to buy me one month of membership. She called they said they don't offer gift cards. So then she came in. And bought a membership for me despite them knowing I had a membership she bought it the second membership. And it was a huge hassle totryy to fix it.⏎ The no food policy is RIDICULOUS. it's all because they got mad that some family had a bday party in their picnic area. Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of ""only snacks"" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks? Idk The policy is ridiculous. And doesn't make much sense to anyone lol.⏎ ⏎ That being said it's still fun but I wish they'd re-evaluate the rule. And understand that not every family can afford their giant birthday package and private party room. And are just trying to make the best of what they can with winter birthdays⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Abby Bachrodt⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Out of town guests from Kansas City who needed a place for an almost 2 year old to burn off some energy.

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Riggott⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review, Jacob!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Larson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: An amazing play place!

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

You can see an inch of dust under the equipment (especially under the slides on the right side), and the dust bunnies are floating around the room. I felt like my eyes were itchy and we didn't stay long because of it.⏎ ⏎ As others pointed out in their reviews, this place STINKS and they need to figure out why. Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.⏎ ⏎ More ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.⏎ ⏎ I'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ashlei Kraemer⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Not enough seating but kids of all ages loved it!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jake Kvanbeck⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jamall Dyar⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: My kids love this indoor playground as it definitely provides hours of fun.

The mother wasn’t paying attention at all and was even in a different room for a while. The mother was addressed about his actions and she didn’t care and was rather rude. The problem with the child continued so the staff was asked if they could intervene as she wasn’t even in the play area or supervising. They said they don’t get involved, and it wasn’t their problem.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest.

I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

The facility requires everyone to remove their shoes but the play sets are made for outdoor use so it really hurt our feet.  The eating area was not very clean & the bathrooms were dirty.  One bathroom didn't have any soap.  The bathrooms only have air dryers but they need towels too.  Most kids strongly dislike the sound of air dryers.

The two-year-and-under area did not have many options. The battery-powered toys were dead.⏎ ⏎ Luckily, it was a big place and there were tons of things to do. The only issue I had was that not all parents supervised their children. They let their older children run around unsupervised. We were on the trampoline at one end with other little ones. There was a preteen boy whom I had seen earlier playing with his mother and three other siblings. He ran right up to my daughter and jumped, landing as heavily as he could two inches away from my toddler. If he had missed and landed on her, he would have hurt her. We had to take her off the trampoline. His mother was nowhere near him. I saw her in a different area with her other three children.⏎ ⏎ Parents, if you cannot manage your children, or if your children are not well-behaved, do not bring them at all.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Daniel Hoffman Jr⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Fun place to take the kids when the weather is gross!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chris Palm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Inner Active Playground in Plymouth, Minnesota is absolutely awesome!

And it was the worst experience ever. On the top of it pricey for no good reason, the rooms not bright enough, pictures are dark because of the bad lighting. furthermore, we were treated very rude from the their  worker, after we finished from the room, we tried to sat in the craftier while the kids are playing. So we moved some chairs to sat together as a group, the worker came up to us screaming to put the chairs back that we are not allowed to move them. It was so bad for me in front of my guests. So I emailed the owner right away, but I didn’t get any response back. So clearly they do not care. So DO NOT west your money here. Go Urban Air, best customer service and you get what you pay for. The only reason I had my party here, is because I have an infant and I thought here will be better but not.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mary Facchino⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Thank you so much for the 5 stars Mary!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kimberly Bell⏎ Rating: 2/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: I appreciate the convenience of the non-staff entry but I have the say the cleanliness was questionable. A lot of the equipment was visibly dirty and the soap was out in the bathroom. Made for an icky feeling in flu season. I went there mainly for the under 2 section and it was pretty depressing. A lot of the play equipment had broken parts. Push- tricycles without handles or steering wheels and broken pieces that my tot kept playing with. Needs some love and new stuff. And soap.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Audrey Koeck⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: You guys need some new vending machines.

Is my favorite place to go in the winter time!

When you walk through the first set of doors you cannot advance further. Would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time online. Because trying to buy them on arrival is super frustrating. You are stuck between the two doors that are still the entryway, and so you have to stand there and order tickets while your kids are waiting to get in and other people are trying to get in past you. I tried 2 different cards online and it didn't work (which my cards worked fine before and after this place and have plenty of money)  So my friend had to use hers, and it worked. I look at my account and they charge my account four times and then charged it an additional four times for a dollar fee. It charged me four times and we never got any code.So my cards were working, but the website was weird. Then I see there's multiple refunds on my account while we are there. Then I all of a sudden, get 2 emails with codes 30 minutes later. What's someone else's name on it? Which doesn't make sense since I used my phone?So how was there someone else's name on my code. I went to run outside to grab a water and had my daughter stand by the door to let me back in. Since I didn't have the code and it was on my friend's phone. However, they have it so that you cannot open the door from the inside, no handles, which is a safety hazzard. And my daughter couldn't open the door to let me back in. My daughter had to run through and find my friend to give me the code. My friend even walked over to open the door but they have no handles on the inside to open the door for me. So I had to wait for her to find the code on her phone again for me to enter it. What she had to hold up to the glass so I could see to enter the code to enter in again even though we were already inside and had already paid. It doesn't appear that there's any staff there at all to help you. Kind of makes me worry that there's nobody there if there were problems. To add to that, I would say, the price is pretty high for what's there. The pictures online look much cooler than the place actually is and the pictures online are kind of deceiving. The cost to get in there is the same cost as urban air and urban area is much better quality. I would say the place is just okay, but honestly I think the admission should be about anywhere from $5 to $8. They have some cool features, but it really is just an indoor play set. I have been to other indoor playgrounds that charge a lot less. The signs everywhere are a little intense. At one point another boy hurt my daughter and her finger looked broken, I don't think it is but very swollen but there are no staff to ensure safety and that kids are not being too aggressive. Just so many odd signs, one of them being that it's a crime to enter without paying, which duh...  you should pay. But then even more signs in the two year old area that if you are able to read the sign that you're too old to be in this area. Which also a duh. But if there were some staff there to ensure rules were being followed, there wouldn't need to be so many signs. I don't know. Just overall, experience wasn't very good especially  trying to get in and the handle less door was not the greatest, priced too high, buying tickets in-between the outside doors with the cold was a little ridiculous. I don't normally leave reviews, but wanted to leave this because if I would have seen a review like this.I probably would have tried to go somewhere else.⏎ ⏎ To also add i tried calling my friend's phone and she didn't see my call and may daughter almost couldn't hear me through the glass door so I can to shout for her to hear me. If my daughter hadn't not been by the door and my friend never saw her phone I would have been locked outside for a long time. Which is also worrisome.⏎ ⏎ My 7YO and 6YO were bored in the first few minutes of being here i had to convince them to stay and try and make friends since we spent so much money to get in.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kathy Stroth⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Kathy, thank you so much for the five star review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Amy Rogers⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Super way to let kids go crazy!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kevin Dahm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 7 months ago⏎ Review: Pretty cool.

I do not know. I was sitting in the break room and the employee shouted at me in front of everyone in a very loud voice. I told her I am very sorry and that she is an autistic child.

I changed a diaper in the family bathroom, only to turn around and see the sink was out of order. So I went to the women’s bathroom to wash my hands, only to find there was no soap. Thankfully there was soap at the sink in the seating area. I wish there was a phone number posted around the building that you can text if something needs attention. Then the owners can assess if it needs immediate attention or can wait until later. I’ve tried emailing in the past but haven’t gotten quick responses.⏎ ⏎ Overall, I appreciate this place and what it’s provided for us, but wish it was better updated and maintained for the price we pay.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Patty Miller⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thank you so much for the review!

I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face.

I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

My 2-year old twins love it. They have a gated section for 0-3 yr old to play around and an opened section for big kids. Their are a bunch of crawl spaces, tunnels, and slides to slide down, climb, and move around in. I'm definitely going back, and we will be regular. I believe that during the weekdays, the cost per child is $5.50 toward the end of the day, and the weekend is $8 (supervising adult is free). There are signs that everybody must wear socks for hygiene, safety, and to protect the playground, but because the staff does not monitor carefully, there are some parents who disregard the signs and have a lack of respect and courtesy for the facility guidelines, so you will see them wearing shoes.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mohammed Rahman⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: $8 for my 2.5 year old’s entry and $4 for his socks. The toddler area is not manned at all times so there was an influx of older kids coming in. This raised our concerns for our toddler’s safety so we left early. I hope they implement the “toddler-only” policy in the toddler area strictly. The front desk staffer was understanding and took our feedback well. Thanks.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nate J⏎ Rating: 3/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: The park is great! Tons of fun things to do for kids of all ages groups. I can't give it 5 stars because they allow the ""Hover Parents"" to follow their kids thru the tunnels. So while my kid is running around 20 feet in the air, he encounters a 200lb man completely blocking the way... Then he comes back saying, ""There was a big guy, he was scary!"" Seriously, people, let your kids explore on their own. They don't need you on top of them!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before! Please be careful parents when you bring your littles here, hate to see all of Sherburne Co.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away. We will never be back.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kevin O'Keefe⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: Edited 11 months ago⏎ Review: Perfect for young kids.

The playground is designed for younger children, and it’s high-quality, safe, and super engaging.

Super Clean place, well organized & a friendly-and appreciative owner definitely made our two hour long (round trip) drive worth it!   We work with children so we know exactly what to look for in a setting to maintain safety, child development and encourage free play.  This “Funland” certainly met our expectations.   Age appropriate for crawling infants all the way up to our oldest kiddos- age 13.  (They were well aware to watch out for the “Littles” and they were also able to enjoy themselves)  Having rented the entire space for our “private event” was more than worth the price to have the evening to ourselves.  The party rooms, adult massage chairs work great.  The sensory room is ideal for toddlers & young preschoolers.  The bounce pad alone entertained everyone -of all ages our entire 2 hours.  We all agreed that not only would we come back as individuals but we will host most private events here as the set up was so perfect.  Thanks again for hosting us!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away. We will never be back.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Kevin O'Keefe⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: Edited 11 months ago⏎ Review: Perfect for young kids.

Our 1 year old was in need of a fun stop to play and this place was perfect. Really enjoyed my drink, which I could sip while watching him play in a safe, fun enclosed space. I noticed they took extra care to make sure it was “childproof” even putting electrical covers on behind furniture.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

My 4 year old niece just loved to run around the play area and try all the different climbing and slides.  She loved the big spinning space ship looking thing to ride on and the see-saw that seats four kids at a time.  We loved that she could run around the huge play area, but from the elevated walkway, I could keep track of her at all times, while her mom was on the ground with her.  The price is so reasonable, I think it was $15 for a kid and $3 for any spectators (adults).

Why make an entire picnic area with plug ins and counters if it can't be utilized. This idea of ""only snacks"" and not a meal. Sorry But I thought this whole thing was so we had an indoor space during the winter. It's supposed to be like an indoor park. Normally in the summer I might grab a kids meal or a pizza and then go to the local park and eat it. But now it's like this weird rule of like no pizzas no burgers no sandwiches but yes snacks? Idk The policy is ridiculous. And doesn't make much sense to anyone lol.⏎ ⏎ That being said it's still fun but I wish they'd re-evaluate the rule. And understand that not every family can afford their giant birthday package and private party room. And are just trying to make the best of what they can with winter birthdays⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Abby Bachrodt⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Out of town guests from Kansas City who needed a place for an almost 2 year old to burn off some energy.

It is based on the number of children who are playing, with lower rates for anyone 'watching'.⏎ I understand entirely, why. It's clean (and cleaned by employees throughout the day); there is a picnic/cafeteria area where you can eat food you bring with you (and but drinks at a credit card only machine); there are separate areas with different focus areas according to age, physical strength and interests ('camping', climbing, toddler slides, multi-layer play scale, etc). There are clean restrooms for different genders, and a family restroom for adults with several kids along.⏎ In short, it's a wonderful play area for all ages and abilities. Each person may not want to try everything, or be able to, but that leaves more fun to try later, on future trips.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Riggott⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 10 months ago⏎ Review: Thanks for the review, Jacob!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Larson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: An amazing play place!

Within the first few months of opening we had a couple memberships gifted to us, but were apparently using them incorrectly (due to a glitch in their system). Without warning or explanation, we received an email saying we owed them $60 and that if we didn't pay it within 1 day, they'd cancel our membership and ban us for life. I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve. It was a beautiful day and we were one of THREE groups in the entire place. I understand procedures, but exceptions should be possible when we were literally half the guests there. Both things make us hesitant to return. Pictures are from the empty play area from the birthday.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara “Tami” Stai⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Mike Rutledge⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Wonderful, safe place for kids to play.

The inside of this play café is very aesthetically pleasing, but also colorful for a child’s visual appeal. The owner is super friendly and engaging with all guests and children. I attended a fun Easter/Bluey event, and my 3 year old and her friend had a blast! There were crafts, snacks, gift bags, an egg hunt, and lots of fun & music with Bluey! Great selection of imaginative play toys and different ball pits to fit the needs of all age groups, from babies to toddlers! The calming/sensory room was very relaxing. Very reasonable and fair pricing. Plenty of places to sit while your children play.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest.

I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

Mother of Cashew purchased the birthday package for 10 kids and you would have to pay for additional kids who show up. LaTasha was our hostess and she hit it out of the park. Things to know, you need to sign a waiver before you enter the main area with the iPad by the register. Another step is taking off your shoes before you go into the main seating area. The kids and jump, slide, run, etc all over the building. They do have some bikes but you have to pay extra, there's time included with the bday package. LaTasha brought us the cupcakes, drinks and helped pick up after the party. This is a safe place to have a party so we recommend the place.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: P Eliz⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 weeks ago⏎ Review: Very clean , great staff friendly and caring , my kids love it here !⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jennifer Ponce⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 weeks ago⏎ Review: Fun indoor playground.

The package we got was apparently the kids meal package even though we brought our own pizza and cake. So that means that every kid after the first 10 kids is $39 dollars extra per kid. Which cost more than the entry fee. We had a total of 24 kids we spent $957 dollars for the kids to play on a jungle gym. Our hostess was apparently on break and abesnt the whole party. We passed out the food, poured the drinks, picked up all the trash. No announcements are made, no rounding up kids, no helping with the cake. By the end of it my wife was ready to put on her kids empire shirt and clock in and I was ready to put on the dragon suit and hop around for the parade. What exactly did 957 dollars get me? Not to mention, there wasn't enough cups or plates either, but that's okay we brought our own. Save yourself some money and go to urban air or a skating rink if your having a birthday party for more than just your immediate family.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Jaime Mariño⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Everything is very special.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Niani Ife⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Very good area for babies under 2⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nathan Chisolm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 months ago⏎ Review: Great place to bring your child to play or have a birthday party!

I love that there is plenty of space for active play but there is also a quiet sensory room, two ball pits, and dedicated spaces for the littlest guests. It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored. We have been coming here since it opened and one thing that stands out to me is that Kirsten, the owner, is constantly making tweaks and improvements based on feedback.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

I love that there is plenty of space for active play but there is also a quiet sensory room, two ball pits, and dedicated spaces for the littlest guests. It’s not so big that your kids will get lost, with frequently rotating toys so they don’t get bored.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit. Overall we had a great experience and the owner played a large part in that. I’m excited to take my boys back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Christy Arendt⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: We loved our time at peekabooboo’s and can’t wait to go back.

The facility is very clean & the owner is beyond friendly. She regularly checked in on us to see how we were doing, introduced herself & made an effort to connect with your child. It was a little packed but for a Saturday morning, it wasn’t too bad. There is a great variety of activities for kids of all ages. My three year old loved playing with the fire station & sensory bins, while the babies loved the play gym.

Everything was perfect for babies and I been to few places and haven’t found a place I fell in love with and knew it was perfect for my baby. But this place was perfect for her and age appropriate.

I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face.

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms.

I visited with my 4-year-old and we both had a great time. There are plenty of activities to keep little ones entertained, and I loved that there were lots of other moms to chat with—you never feel alone, which is such a bonus. The place is very clean, actually smells fresh, and the air conditioning kept things comfortable the whole time.

The place is fun but for almost 1000 dollars they did not let us know you are not reserving the whole space for yourself, their will still be random people playing too. Just for that i’d find a different place. Second the power was out the whole time, we had to still have the party because it was 20 mins before it started. They did not do a full refund which they should have since we had no AC in june, no sound, no lights, no moving toys ( The best part of the place). The costumer service was just okay. The girls working were amazing! They helped set up and were very kind, the manger was acting like they could barely refund us and that no AC was fine ( It was hot). They did refund everything but the deposit which for all the problems it should have been a full refund. So overall the place is fun to play at but I would not have another birthday here, or advise someone.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Nouran Elebiary⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a week ago⏎ Review: Love it⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Sahil Hamidi⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 2 weeks ago⏎ Review: ""Chairland is the ultimate kids' playground!

The party package for 10 children was reasonably priced, although it’s worth noting that pizza, drinks, tips, and taxes are extra—so just be prepared for that when budgeting.⏎ ⏎ The playground environment is clean, safe, and packed with fun. There’s an interactive screen game where kids throw soft balls to earn credits, and one of the biggest highlights was the giant ball tube overhead. It collects balls from the ceiling and releases them like a ball rain—pure joy for the kids! There’s also a piano slide that plays notes as kids slide down, climbing areas, pretend play kitchens for mini chefs, and even small bikes and strollers for toddlers to ride around.⏎ ⏎ The party setup was nicely arranged. The staff helped with balloons and decor, and while the utensils were basic, they had everything we needed. The kids had a blast with bubbles, music, and cake time. I loved that I didn’t have to do much—just enjoyed catching up with friends while the kids played their hearts out.⏎ ⏎ Overall, a fun and hassle-free experience that I’d recommend for parents planning a kids’ birthday party!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Emmanuelle York⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: The perfect place for my toddler⏎ Super clean⏎ Everything is safety⏎ I feel in calm when i visit there with my toddler⏎ ⏎ Five stars place⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Gary Tortorella⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a month ago⏎ Review: Awesome place for kids to play!

I have NEVER requested any discount on ANYTHING. You are LYING at any point; you are just making things up to justify how TERRIBLE things are and the AWFUL service you provide, since you deceive people by offering a package that you don't deliver. 2- The Host was clearly present and all he did was wait at the entrance to register the children, NOTHING ELSE, the Host at no time told me when the bubble party was, he only called me so the children could go eat and I MYSELF had to distribute the pizzas, drinks and attend to EVERYONE since he DID NOT HELP ME at all when he had told me that he would be the one who was going to distribute the pizzas and in the end he DID NOT do it, apart from that he did not let the children eat because he was rushing us all to sing happy birthday, I told him to cut the cake and HE DESTROYED IT ALL and my husband had to interfere so that a relative could finish cutting it and that also has to be on the security cameras why don't you talk about it if you really saw the cameras ?? 3- You say that the gift bags are of HIGH value and you only give a plastic piñata. 4- You know you provide bad service and pay to have bad reviews deleted. A friend of mine also had a VERY BAD time at her party there. She left a bad review and you called her to offer her $100 to delete it. How many other people have you paid to do the same? What you're saying is blatant slander, disrespect, liars, and NOT AT ALL professional. To anyone reading this, DO NOT HAVE YOUR PARTY HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A BAD TIME AND LOSE YOUR MONEY.

The setup is great for a birthday party, with fun activities like a dance party and bubbles that keep kids entertained.⏎ ⏎ However, the customer service left a lot to be desired. The two staff members assigned to our party lacked enthusiasm and engagement, which really put a damper on the experience. One of them stood in the corner with a bubble machine, barely interacting with the children, and their overall attitude made it seem like they didn’t want to be there. Unfortunately this was captured in the video that we took of the children singing and dancing during the bubbles party. When hosting children’s parties, the staff should be energetic, friendly, and engaging.This was not the case here.⏎ ⏎ If you're looking for a place to drop in and play, Cheerland USA is a great option. But if you’re booking a birthday party, I’d recommend making sure the staff assigned to your event are experienced and actually enjoy being around kids. With better training and a more engaged team, this place could be fantastic for children ages 5 and under.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Lisa Kelsey Burleson⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Yosvani Valdes⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Great place!!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Sayed Balkhi⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 3 months ago⏎ Review: Worst place and worst customer service.

A lot of other playgrounds are more for big kids, but this one is just right for smaller kids to play safely and have fun.⏎ ⏎ It’s also much cleaner than places like Cheeky Monkeys and JW.⏎ ⏎ We really love coming here, and I hope they can offer some membership promotions in the future — the regular price is a bit too high for us right now⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Ben Booth⏎ Rating: 1/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: To clarify, you ONLY responded after WE followed up nearly a week later. Your offer to “work it out” included either paying 3–4x more (around $2K with fees) or “transferring to friends,” which you know aren’t realistic solutions.⏎ ⏎ Had you responded as promptly as you did to this review, you could have reopened the time slot much sooner. And let’s be honest—availability for the entire weekend is still open, except for one existing reservation. It seems like you’re struggling to book new reservations, which doesn’t reflect well on your business and yet doesn’t surprise me given what I’m seeing here.⏎ ⏎ After revisiting past reviews, I stand by my decision not to bring my 12-month-old into an environment with much older kids, where injuries have been noted with photo evidence. You should consider making reasonable exceptions and thinking about long-term goodwill in the community instead of rigidly enforcing policies that drive potential customers away.⏎ ⏎ Not only will I be sure to never visit your establishment, but I’ll also be sure to share my experience with other local parents.⏎ ⏎ ——⏎ ⏎ Unfortunately not very responsive and lack empathy to the customer regarding their policy on refunds.⏎ ⏎ We quickly realized having made an error and within a business day asked for a refund given the reservation wasn’t for private use of the space as we thought and were ignored until we followed up again nearly a week later, to have the policy shoved back in our face and be told “plans are already being made”⏎ ⏎ It’s a kid’s birthday party two months out, no plans are being made. If they had responded within a quicker timeframe and without having us chase them, they would have had the space opened back up for other potential reservations.⏎ ⏎ Very unfortunate as the reasoning for it not being a good fit today is solely due to our daughter’s young age at less than one. The other reviews made clear that bigger kids are often present and as it’s not a private party, we simply aren’t comfortable having her in that environment yet. We probably would have been great customers in the future but the operator is too short sighted to understand that.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Joe Huff⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: jimma roberts⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: We did not regret choosing Cheerland-Mckinney.

My daughter just turned two and is obsessed with dinosaurs. I’m so glad we found a place that caters to Dino loving kiddos, or any kiddo. We were able to rent the entire place and the decor is absolutely beautiful, cute, posh, and kid friendly. It was just wonderful to have alerting taken care of for you. We purchased the package that included cupcakes and the Dino that comes out to dance. I was also impressed with how organized it was and there were different play areas each with its own play theme. My daughter loved the little kitchen area and some of our little guests enjoyed wearing the costumes that were set up in the back. Jill helped us coordinate our party and was just absolutely kind and walked me through everything. They did let us bring our own cake and food. Some of the parents went next door to get some coffee because with that many kids running around, you need to keep up. That in itself was convenient for the adults. The goody bags that were provided had some fun quality toys in there. We appreciated the nice personal touches like the slide show photos of our daughter and the little sign with her picture on it was so sweet. Dino Kidz really went that extra mile.This is the Allen location. I would’ve chosen the one in Carrollton, but most of our guests live closer to Allen. We can’t wait to visit the Carrollton location soon.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Anna Aldieny⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: Thank you for the 5-star review!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: KANWAL AGHA⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 5 months ago⏎ Review: We been coming here for past one year this place is amazing specially Jill is awesome and her customer service is out of this world she is so so so amazing she welcome us every time my daughter loves to come here we love this place and we love u Jill so so so much⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Roberto Oliva⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: Super clean and everything to entertain your kiddo's.

Today we celebrated my daughter’s first birthday here and I literally can’t even put into words to explain my gratitude and happiness for this place. First of all let’s talk about cleanliness and space, this is hands the cleanest play place in all of DFW. Everything always looks so immaculate  every time we come in. You can tell they care a lot about the health of children with how clean they keep it. They’re always adding new things, the space is open, and there is so much to do for all ages, from a babies to 9 year olds. Second, price point, which for me is huge. So many play places now a days don’t have many budget friendly options. Dino kidz has that still while having the cutest special customizing that’s included in your package which just made our party feel so elevated! Like the slideshow of pictures of our daughter and the sign out front. Lastly, Jill and the girls are actual angels from heaven and decorated everything so beautifully. They were helpful, kind, informative, and loving to us and all of guests. Anyone who disagrees with that, must have a mental illness. I literally couldn't have gotten through the day without these ladies. Jill is also so good with the kids, she came and sat on the ground and played with my daughter and I for a minute, and my daughter tried to hold on to her which she doesn’t do to most people! They explain the rules about the keeping the door shut and yucky bins and that’s it! Normal rules about not carrying toys when climbing, which thank goodness for that right? We have some wild brothers and older kids in our party, no one broke the rules, no one got yelled at, kids were able to be kids! I love the music and activities they have planned and the schedule for their parties, it keeps the kids interested and no one is sitting around bored. The good-bye bubble party at the end is the best idea. The pictures I took don't even do it justice. I would have my kids party over and over again at Dino Kidz! We thank you guys for giving us the best party for our baby girl. We will never forget it. If you’re looking to plan a party here, I wouldn’t think twice! 10/10⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Abbey Greenwell⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 8 months ago⏎ Review: Absolutely great !!

I was very hesitant when I came to visit the spot after booking online.⏎ The CONS:⏎ 1. The themed decorations were nice but could have been a lot better.⏎ 2. The pizza was cold after sitting too long.⏎ 3. The staff was friendly but didn’t know much about what my party consists of. We had a themed character, a balloonist, & a face painter. The host was not aware until she looked it up.⏎ 4. They only clean 15 minutes before the next party⏎ They leave previous party balloons out even when they don’t match current theme.⏎ 5. Need newer play equipment⏎ 6. Behind the counter is chaotic clutter⏎ 7. Vegetable & Fruit Platter should have been a better presentation. I can get better from Kroger.⏎ 8. Buy your own cupcakes, the ones provided were just ok.⏎ 9. For $1700, I expected a lot more from Dino Kidz not the 3rd party vendors.⏎ ⏎ The PROS:⏎ 1. You get the place just for your party⏎ 2. 3rd party vendors really know how to hype a party, the balloonist was exceptional. The face painter was also wonderful.⏎ 3. The staff was friendly & good at hosting⏎ 4. They set-up & clean up⏎ 5. The dance party was great⏎ 6. The slideshow was a very special touch⏎ ⏎ Overall, because of the balloonist & the themed character we were able to hype the party & make a really nice time.

I would also like to mention Jill. She was fenomenal and helped me as soon as I arrived. I told her it was our first time here and she immediately helped me with getting familiar with the place.

I always worry  about there being too many people for my baby or an over whelming environment for her, but the fact that we had the entire place to ourselves put my mind at such ease. They do all the work like decorating and cleaning and everything in between. So I was over the moon to be able to actually be with my birthday girl and play and celebrate without any stress.

We genuinely had the best time ever!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bonnie “Bonnie” Lee⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: N/A⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Deseree Edholm⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo's is not only my daughter's favorite play cafè, but as a stay at home mom, this is by far the best play cafè out there! Kirsten (the owner) is one in a million who is beyond kind and loving towards anyone who walks into her space. She lights up so many children's lives, including my daughter, and moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, nanny's, etc.!! She always takes the time to make sure everything is going well and willing to help anywhere she can. We love it here and have a 10 count punchcard that allows us to have access anytime we'd like to!  Thank you Peekabooboo's for lighting up so many little humans lives! :)⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Matt LaFontaine⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 11 months ago⏎ Review: This place was such a cool place to take my daughter Mattie the red white and bluey event was amazing she had the best day ever and it was ran great.

The inside of this play café is very aesthetically pleasing, but also colorful for a child’s visual appeal. The owner is super friendly and engaging with all guests and children. I attended a fun Easter/Bluey event, and my 3 year old and her friend had a blast! There were crafts, snacks, gift bags, an egg hunt, and lots of fun & music with Bluey! Great selection of imaginative play toys and different ball pits to fit the needs of all age groups, from babies to toddlers! The calming/sensory room was very relaxing. Very reasonable and fair pricing. Plenty of places to sit while your children play.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.

Loved the hoops and the  trampoline.  The only thing was I ended up getting sick the next day. I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face. Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

I’m not blaming anyone but I feel like if your child is not feeling all to well, please refrain from visiting indoor places made for children. I thank god that my son did not get sick. There was the cutest little boy who was very active, and very talkative, but from observation he had a lot of bloody snot dripping down his nose and was coughing in my face.

Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

Avery’s adventure was the only place I had gone to that day.⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Bobbi Jo Barthelemy⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: 4 months ago⏎ Review: Not overly stimulating or crowded.

My four year old particularly loves to play on the rock walls, trampoline and foam pit! I am always noticing he gets braver and more adventurous each time we go. Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy. This place is a family favorite!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Chelsea Hengeveld⏎ Rating: 4/5⏎ Time: 6 months ago⏎ Review: This play area is best for kids under 5.

This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

My four year old particularly loves to play on the rock walls, trampoline and foam pit! I am always noticing he gets braver and more adventurous each time we go. Our 15 month old is always engaged in the toddler area, the area is perfect for him to practice all of his new skills safely. The special events that Avery’s hosts are always exciting for my oldest. Nerf Night is his absolute favorite! Me and my husband love the comfortable seats for us to watch our kiddos play, and the environment is always clean and tidy.

I love bringing my grandbabies here, they love it! They both are generally healthy, until I take them here which is getting to be less and less now. This last time my grandbabies ended up getting sick (GI). Before this they would get the snotty, coughing stuff after leaving here. I see NOTHING inside the lobby about if your kids is sick you should not be here! I NEVER see them shutting down for an hour or so to do a thorough clean, NEVER smells sanitized either, doors/walls/balls/bikes/blocks, toys... don't get wiped down, the nasty is still there from the day before!

No drinking fountain. The process to get into this place is second to none in terms of difficulty and unnecessary steps. You have to download an app. Zero other places require that. I stood outside with three kids for almost 10 minutes trying to get in. The price for three kids is outrageous considering you do not even have place to refill water bottles. You charge $1.50 for a 16 oz bottle in your vending machine. Socks are $3.50 each, also in the vending machine. You've got tables to eat at but no sink except in the bathrooms. Not worth the drive if you're any more than five minutes away.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.⏎ ⏎ The drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!⏎ ⏎ At first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.⏎ ⏎ The owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.⏎ ⏎ Right inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.⏎ ⏎ Their cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.⏎ ⏎ There is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.⏎ ⏎ Theis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.⏎ ⏎ My husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.⏎ ⏎ Overall a cute little play area. We would recommend it and we’d come back again!⏎ ⏎ -----------------------⏎ ⏎ Reviewer: Natalie Streich⏎ Rating: 5/5⏎ Time: a year ago⏎ Review: Peekabooboo’s is a child’s DREAM (and adult’s)!

At first I was concerned due to all the parking spaces being full, however walking in we were quickly greeted by the owner. She was so nice and accommodating and cheerful. For how busy it was, she was so calm and energized. Due to her demeanor it made for a pleasant introduction for an overwhelmed mom of 2 under 2. The entire time we played (almost 3 hours) Kierstin never stopped moving. She was polite and interacting with all the parents and children. She was quick to make sure items were picked up and put away in the right spot for the next child to enjoy. We attended as a moms group with a lot of littles and she was over the top trying to work with us to make it easier the next time we come visit.
