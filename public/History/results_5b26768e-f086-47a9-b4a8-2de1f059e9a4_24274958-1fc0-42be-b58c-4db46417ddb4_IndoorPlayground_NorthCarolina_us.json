My son had an absolute blast. We were for hours, he just didn’t want to leave. The space is so thoughtfully designed, clean, and inviting. It’s the perfect spot for kids to play freely while parents can relax a bit too. The staff is very friendly, and the overall vibe is welcoming and fun. We’ll definitely be coming back! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, safe play space.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charlene D.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Such a cute spot for so much play! You can tell the owner really poured her heart into making this an interactive play area while incorporating so many local touches from the area. This is very different from the play cafe that is downtown morehead in case anyone was wondering!\nToys and environment were clean. Lots of natural light and something for\nall ages. Especially love the size of the area for the crawlers/littles. We will be back often! Great addition to town.\n\nOnly constructive criticism was for the ice chest in the grocery, those ice cubes traveled far and I found a few in the littles area. Those are a major choking hazard so I turned them into staff for sanitation to make their way back to where they belong. Just do your part as the parent (self explanatory) and you’ll be fine. Everything else was fine!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marissa Kotkin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My son loved coming to Native Play!

So many things for littles to do, so clean, and so much fun! It’s similar to children’s museums, but small enough that you don’t have to hover and follow your little ones everywhere. You can keep your eyes on them no matter where they are playing. It’s super open - which is really really nice and cuts down on anxiety, especially if you have multiples. I’ve wished for somewhere like this for years. Burlington is lucky to have this gem. 🤩\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany White\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Extremely clean and organized.

There is a huge party space in the back! There is even a cafe area where snacks will be sold!}",

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.

She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Briana Willett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jevon Brun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My sons love Funky Frogz!

Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.\nThe space is clean and it’s got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.\nSo thankful we found this place.\nWe will be back 💙\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie marie\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

Do you have babies and/or toddlers and need somewhere indoors, out of the elements for them to play? And you’d love to sit and drink coffee while they play? This is place for you! You can get snacks here or you can bring your own as long as they are no nut products. The bathrooms even have diapers and a Change of clothes if needed! We’re so excited about it. You sign your waiver, take off your shoes, and play. Adding it to my schedule of events for the month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Tolliver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super fun! Great relaxing place to let your kid(s) run around without having to tell them no every 5 min. It’s a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.\n\nSaturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.\n\nI wish there were more gates around doors here though, I’ve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darien Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebastian M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners, the play sets, the crowd, the snack options are really nice and all for a reasonable price.\nI will definitley recomend and come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morar Daniela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Lovely, amazing, super clean place with helpful staff and reasonable prices.\nI’ll be looking to get some sort of membership, my 4yo loves it! 🩵🩵🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impressions are that this place is good fun for the littles.

I love the variety of toys and playhouses they have. My 11 mo granddaughter had a great time playing and exploring. I will definitely bring her back.\nMy only criticism is that the music is a bit louder than it needs to be. The volume mixed with kids playing and yelling is a bit much. Also, maybe play children’s songs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jinnow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Ryan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Delmazeo Sanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ari S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place for my toddler!

Other kids and parents have always been polite too and the play areas have stuff for all different ages to enjoy including for the parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liana Regan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son (3.5) has a blast here!   They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place! Happened upon it on a rainy day and it's perfect for my 1 year old!  Thanks to the Floridan family for making sanford your home!

We appreciate this safe-space for our family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Claus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I come here with my kids all the time. It's big and has plenty of stuff for kids to do, and situated between a coffee place and food store - so it's easy to grab a snack or drink!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Cameron (Kim)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My child loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Beam\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.\n\nWe arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it!

Nice relaxing environment. I love that there is a separate little dining area. We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business.

There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

You can tell the owner really poured her heart into making this an interactive play area while incorporating so many local touches from the area. This is very different from the play cafe that is downtown morehead in case anyone was wondering!\nToys and environment were clean. Lots of natural light and something for\nall ages. Especially love the size of the area for the crawlers/littles. We will be back often! Great addition to town.\n\nOnly constructive criticism was for the ice chest in the grocery, those ice cubes traveled far and I found a few in the littles area. Those are a major choking hazard so I turned them into staff for sanitation to make their way back to where they belong. Just do your part as the parent (self explanatory) and you’ll be fine. Everything else was fine!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marissa Kotkin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My son loved coming to Native Play!

However my child is nonverbal autistic and not potty trained yet. He needs assistance in the bathroom still. Dosnt seem very inclusive if children with higher needs arnt able to participate  due to their disability. Kind of just makes this place feel like a glorified daycare for higher functioning children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: TOSHA BELISLE\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This was such a fun space for my littles to play and explore!

I have been looking for a place that my 2 and 8 year old can be both entertained by equally, and I have found it! Almost 3 hours of fun and they still didn’t want to leave. I appreciate the variety of activities and all sorts of paces. Art room, calm room with low lights and books, a zip line, trampoline, dramatic play area, and tons of swings. They’ve got snacks and a gift shop. Only thing: beware of the classroom they have that releases their kids @ noon, it can go from being real quiet to a mad house in a matter of minutes (don’t worry they leave by 12:30 😉)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Virginia Hernandez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank you so much!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Holly McDonald\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: What a welcoming place bring kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstin Blythe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love this place!

There is also a really cool calming down room where the kids could go when it got too loud or busy, or when they just wanted to stare at the cool bubble tube. We will definitely be back soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dianne Ross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Absolutely amazing!

I've never seen my son have that much fun in his LIFE!!

It's absolutely wonderful to have somewhere catered especially for our kiddos with autism and inclusive to all!!! We can't wait to come back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Obenauer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Best birthday party venue ever!  We had a party for our five year old granddaughter this weekend and it was absolutely perfect!  The kids loved playing in the gym - they loved the zip line, the rock wall, the trampoline, all the swings and the play area with a grocery store, doctor’s office, restaurant and kitchen.\n\nVanessa made planning the party easy and she was very helpful - both in planning and the day of the event.  She went out of her way to make sure every child had a wonderful experience.\n\nI am only sorry we didn’t know about We Rock the Spectrum earlier.

We went for the first time over the weekend with our neurotypical 22 month old and she had a blast. Call ahead of time because they are currently only allowing a small amount of people at a time. Everything was clean, masks worn by all adults, and so many different fun options for the kids. There is something for every kid here! Pretend play section (grocery store/kitchen/baby dolls), various swings and ziplines, things to climb on, a springless trampoline, puppet show, a calming room (which our girl seemed to enjoy), an arts and crafts room, and so much more! Prices are very reasonable.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah DePasquale\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: We had out 1st trip to We rock the spectrum yesterday and it was so amazing!

My Max (7 YO that has Down Syndrome)  absolutely loved it!!!!  He could have stayed all day if I let him. The staff was wonderful with him and knew how to interact and entertain him. The space is perfect for children with special needs but amazing for all children as well. With the pandemic and the unknown at the moment with school, this was what we needed especially for Max, physically. There seems to be something for everyone. Thank you so much for bringing this to the Asheville area. We live in Black Mtn and driving to South Asheville will not be a problem at all. We cannot wait to come back.}",

They prowl the perimeter like they're the police and we managed to have some fun regardless.. Until the end when I stepped onto the mat to help my infant niece and was badgered off the premises for not wearing socks, mind you I was not actually playing... Just..no\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: shirl daz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Amazing time for my granddaughters, and for me coffee and waffles are great\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Irene Nagley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My 6-year-old granddaughter said it best, \"This place is awesome!\"\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DeVan Abram\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I had my son's 6th birthday party here and I couldn't have been more pleased.

They work seamlessly as a team to ensure every customer receives outstanding service. I hosted my son’s birthday last month with an Optimus Prime Transformers theme, and the team was incredibly helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the entire experience. I was so impressed that I referred a friend for her sons’ birthdays (ages 1 and 7), and once again, the staff, venue, and overall atmosphere exceeded expectations. I will definitely continue recommending this location to others!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Salinas Uriel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shnyia Wilson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Batarseh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: One of the cleanest and nicest kids play places in the Charlotte area. All of their locations are great but the Monroe one is the original that we have come to for years. Every time something is broken they fix it immediately and you constantly see someone cleaning. Not to mention the healthy snack choices and the great coffee. Always a a joy to be here\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Myeshia Lowe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Went here for the first time with my girls who are 5 and 3, we were going to do a trampoline park, but I thought Playland would be more age appropriate, and I’m glad I changed my mind. The highlights for my girls were; the ball pit/slide, the kid cafe, the spin tops, and the big middle slide. While seated I did see numerous employees sweeping, wiping tables, and checking the bathrooms. My husband and I enjoyed the sweets they had to offer. We tried a crepe and the Oreo waffle, they both were good!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexie Love\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Bocklett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great birthday party!!

Essential for any kids birthday party. Worth a visit here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alecia McGriff\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited 6 months ago\nReview: Our children had fun. As adults we were really uncomfortable as one of the staff literally watched our kids and said something to them every time they did anything but he wouldn't say anything to any of the other kids not following rule. He would literally walk past them to come say something to my son and nephew. I found this odd as we were the only black family there.  I probably won't go back. It is fun for kids but not for my kind of people....\n\nAs I stated yesterday we were made aware and the kids only went in there once. There were tons of other kids at the same age but of a different race in the toddler area and the guy seen them. He only said something to our children because we were the only black family. And to keep from taking ownership someone who wasnt even there gets on here and tries to paint my children as the bad guy but wont tell you how my children helped the guy clean up as the other children played wild and out of control. My son also had another child flip him the bird. Parents bring their kids here and don't pay any attention once they get there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: The kids thoroughly enjoyed the play area and ran around for nearly two hours straight. Everything appeared to be well maintained and overall pretty clean. The real treat though is the Cafe and the amazing coffee for the adults. The Tiramisu Iced coffee was delicious as was the caramel blondie.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirsten Hower\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This place is beautiful, a lot of fun, safe, secure, and has a very friendly staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tania Z\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I’m so glad that my daughter is now old enough to run around this place and have a wonderful time with her friends🤩💫😍 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Philip Kedzuch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: viktor egov\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennıfer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erica Lovings\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gabrielle Deel\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My son is Autistic has sensory issues, so I was spinning him on the spinning seats in front of the toddler area and beside of the ball pit, he was laughing, smiling, and sitting with his head back against the padding looking up at the ceiling while I spun him. A worker came up to us, while we’re actively playing, and told us that we needed to stop because he is “spinning too fast and looks like he’s going to start gagging and be sick!” Okay, while I appreciate the “concern” I know my child, I’m actively playing with my 3yr old who LOVES spinning and sensory play. I could understand if my son was screaming, crying or standing up while spinning.. something OTHER THAN laughing and asking and signing for “more spinning”.. He begged me to spin him more after something was said and I had to explain to him that “mommy can’t spin you anymore” he got so upset he asked to go home.. He is THREE!! A three year old, or any child, should not have experience discrimination..I have friends who have had similar experiences with their children whom aren’t neurotypical.. This place is NOT inclusive for those with intellectual disabilities and I will be filing a formal complaint.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather Baker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 8 months ago\nReview: Super fun place with a chill staff. We didn't have to buy their socks. I didn't feel like they were breathing down our necks about every tiny infraction of the rules. I felt like my toddler could be a toddler and just have fun. He didn't run wild but he climbed up the slide once or twice and didn't get yelled at. We've been back and will go back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris Roach\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: It can be a challenge sometimes to find something all your children will enjoy.

I informed an employee, he came over and did one check. As soon as he walked away it was swarmed again. We gave up and left with a refund. The front desk worker said, “parents need to watch their kids”. I’d feel better going once she’s older but there’s no point in having a toddler area if that’s not enforced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denisha Garayua\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: It was our first time going here and my daughter loved it.

Brought my 6 and almost 2 year old and they played for 2 hours! There is a massage chair for adults also!\n\nLots of snacks and drinks, and you can bring your own. The party rooms were so cute too!\n\nIt was huge and overrun with people.

My child has so much fun here every time and I get to relax a little bit while he’s making new friends.\nMy concern/problem with this place is the foam blocks. Little pieces come off and get all over his body, from his hair to his socks. Wish it was ball pit instead.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haley Robinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I like that parents are aloud on equipment.

This is by far our favorite establishment to go to. I love how cool they keep the building for the kids and parents. They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nick Lackey\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that’s intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out…. I walked away… about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife’s mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn’t melt. All this to say, if you don’t pay the 200$ for a party, don’t take any food or drinks…and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don’t ask if you can bring anything in… you’ll probably get talked about like your a criminal… total of 150$ spent here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joel Crotts\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ricky Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: They have some games to play and plenty of space for the kiddos to play and run and bounce out their energy! Lots of obstacles and levels to play in, a slide from the top level of the play / climbing area.\nWent today and they have rearranged the kids play area some which opened the play area up some.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dina P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: Updated review - 5/22/25\n\nFirst time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn’t help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn’t put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.\n\nThen wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn’t wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can’t I’m super clean I can’t let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!\n\nThen I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!\n\nWould I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn’t happy\n\nThat broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juniel\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had a birthday party and was really bad, nothing fun, it is not according to the description of the page, I even feel cheated because it's not even close to expectations. What a disappointment. Bad place to celebrate 😔 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Marte\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The worst of the places to celebrate birthdays, I feel cheated, I paid a lot of money only for 2 pizzas, a couple of juices, a poor table and a decoration of the worst and to they liking, the bracelets are useless you can't play on the machines even paying for a birthday party, they don't have music, they don't make the birthday boy happy, they don't do anything to celebrate a birthday in that place. Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash Jay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We've been coming to this establishment for years! We love this place. The staff are amazing. The manager here is very professional. She makes sure the children feel safe at all times! If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth James\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexi Helton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Had my daughter’s 2nd birthday party here.\nRooms were clean and staff were super sweet and accommodating.

They’ve made some changes and opened it up inside.  Everything felt clean and organized.  I’m so grateful to have something like this in our community.

Reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sharon Weber\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda S\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.\nThey had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Botello-Joffe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We had my son's birthday here and the staff made it so easy!

They have a lot to do and keeps my kids busy and mine have a lot of energy and this place will tire them out. I like this place better than the trampoline parks. They even have COFFEE and snacks. Very nice and neat place and feel comfortable with my kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great for kids of all ages\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kylie Leonard\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The “toddler area” gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn’t get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you’re going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cinthia Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: tomas aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scott Wilson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Great place to take your young children to play.

We've brought our now 2.5 year old here for the past year whenever we are in  town visiting and he loves it.  The ball pit, maze, giant slides, and trampolines are fantastic, and the downtown Salisbury street with the shops that kiddos can play in is a cute addition. Staff are super friendly as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justine Alexa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Philip johnston\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was fantastic when it first opened, but unfortunately, it has declined over time. The cleanliness has become a major issue, with unpleasant odors, visible stains, and deteriorating foam blocks that haven’t been replaced. It’s disappointing to see the lack of upkeep.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Moulton\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Bishop\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: If they had a zero I’d leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don’t fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don’t even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn’t let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I’m another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don’t tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you’re business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Weaver (Kris)\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We had a lot of fun and games for everyone to play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Myers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savannah Sabol-Ross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ludek Vasatko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super 😉 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raven Mcdonald\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kaitlyn toof\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids are obsessed with this place, it’s a great arcade/ jump place, inexpensive & clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bobbie Jo Kelly Greene\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: We had a Birthday party and it was great!!

This was the second time I’ve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It’s not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robyn Lesondak\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Eaton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivelisse Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Khyati Sheth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2 year old loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Larry Ford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for the kids and parents.

She had the nerve to question my son and his cousins age. As if they were lying about how old they are. She said it very nasty too. Then she decided she would half way help me sign the waiver and half way speak or assist me. Didn’t even tell me I needed to scan the QR code. But began helping a woman behind me fill out the waiver and explained it to her step by step. I said “thank you” to her twice within a few minutes. She didn’t respond to either. I’ve brought my son here a couple times because he loves it here. But I promise miss thing in the front with the enough attitude for everyone in Rowan County….move her elsewhere!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Himes\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had fun with my grandson on a Friday afternoon!

However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Stern\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn’t expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol\nThis was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molly McClure\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Always a wonderful time at the Fun Factory!

Parents were allowed in the equipment which was great for my shy 2 yr old.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelynn Adams\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any “special” event… this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter’s wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to “sit down and have a special snack” that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn’t tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren’t even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Bartlett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don’t know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn’t take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn’t have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn’t have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mitzi Bare\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the \"reserved\" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the \"manager\" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: crystal moton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids love this place and I love taking them here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Moore\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: One of my daughter's favorite places to visit, the staff is always nice and the mango bubble tea is delicious.

Get there no one is doing this. Go to buy socks for my 14 month old and they charge me and can see he is little bitty. Shows me the socks and says this is all I have and the size was like a 2 to 4 year old size. Oh we can't give refunds she says. Many repairs need to be done in the building. Lots of trim pieces and floor pieces missing or falling off all over. I would drive to another location over this one next time but was there for a birthday party\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dubon Mejia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: nekeisha prawl\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bradley Rogers\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle richeson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun for all\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Timothy Siegel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews…What you see is what you get in their pictures…Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I’ve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning…\n\nIt’s one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents\n\nPlace is priced perfect… it’s not the biggest but it’s not for older kids…The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It’s injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry…\n\nThe food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven’t seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child…\n\nIt feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more…they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jackie Posnanski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun place for my granddaughters to play! One of the best things is that Adults can play too!!!!!!  Great price, very nice staff, everything is clean and they have Coffee there for me so I can keep up with my granddaughters haha.

I took five of my six granddaughters for two hours of playtime at approximately $81 for all six of us for entry.\n\nIt’s modern with plenty of areas for the kids to explore, climb, and play. There is a separate gated play area towards the rear to accommodate smaller children or little ones with disabilities. Plenty of seating for the adults is available near the Cafe or cubbies near the ball pit and other areas.\n\nDon’t forget to remove your shoes on the playground and wear some socks! Call ahead to ensure it’s not closed for a private party or event.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tracy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Pros: The place was really clean.  The staff was friendly.  My daughter is 3 and had an amazing time! There were lots of things for her to do.  She never got bored in the two hours we were there. Ball pit,  swings,  tricycles, slides,  etc. The prices at the Cafe were fairly reasonable. No need to purchase socks,  just make sure you bring your own.\n\nCons: parking was atrocious on the weekend,  we had to circle it twice to find a spot.  There are only two stalls in the bathroom.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jared Clark\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Great Playland location with a lot of things for the kids to play with! The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a large steel pole to the right of the slides that doesn’t have any padding on it…It just needs padding before someone gets hurt running into it. Everything else was great !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leah Millsap\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Visiting over the Christmas/new year holiday with our 5yr old. After 3 straight rainy days, we needed to get out and play. We googled and found Playland. 2hrs of indoor play geared for 1-10yrs olds for $16 is amazing!!! We don’t have it in ENC.\n\nHighlights:\nClean/safe\nPositive/chill atmosphere\nEmployees circulate and interact as needed with kids. They are positive and happy to see kids playing - not grumpy or bothered or constantly yelling “no, don’t do that”. This really is a playground for your kid to let loose and enjoy climbing, jumping, falling, running, all the things. Seems like a family run place that really has put a lot of thought into how kids play and enjoy lots of diverse stimuli to interact around them.\n\nMy five year old played hard for 2hrs straight!\n\nThere’s padded benches, seats, and cafe tables. Lots of seating to supervise at a distance if your kid is at that stage. It’s also very normal to get into the space and play with your littles too.\n\n*there is even a smaller play area that is gated for littles to get in if that’s your pace.\n\nDidn’t try the cafe yet but many folks had hotdogs, waffles, coffees, grilled sandwiches, and yummy kids snacks. Sitting back with a cold coffee and chilling while kiddos burn their energy is a great business concept!\n\nOnly con:\nI wish I could’ve brought in our water bottles. Their sign says no outside food/drinks. There is 100% access to water fountains. In hindsight I’m sure I could’ve asked if water was ok. Check next time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: KM\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I used to really like this indoor playground — it was clean, well-maintained, and felt like a safe space for my baby to play. Unfortunately, it seems like the quality has been slipping lately. Things are getting noticeably dirtier, and some of the equipment is starting to be worn down.\n\nDuring a recent visit, I was shocked to find poop in the play area. I reported it to the staff immediately. While they said they would clean it, I was surprised there was no apology or even a simple “thank you” for reporting it. I made sure to clarify that it wasn’t from my child, and all I got was, “It’s ok”.\n\nCleanliness and hygiene are critical in a space meant for babies and toddlers — and so is a respectful, professional response when serious issues are raised.\n\nWill not come anymore.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K Henry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: My kids had a blast!  Love that they have a wide age range of kids that can enjoy playing. I have a newly 2 year old, 4 year old, and 9 year old. All had a great time. The snacks are reasonably priced, we loved it!  Great closed in area for 3 and under.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Sison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The staff,  cleanliness, offerings, are all wonderful.   There's an area for younger kids to play.  They offer a variety of drinks and foods.   They serve warm crepes, quesadilla, and hot dogs.  They also have a good coffee selection.   Having been to a few in the area this one has great service overall.   I do wish the space was a little larger to space out the play  areas a little more.   Love They don't require us to buy their own socks.   Definitely love spending time and the kids love it, too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie_kyy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: First time at the Pineville location and we’ll be back for sure! Love how bright and airy it is. I can enjoy my favorite brunch crepe(a must try!), sit back and relax cause my 4 year old is visible anywhere she goes in the playground. She’s obsessed with riding/racing the bikes on the track and loves the “pink castle” where she pretends to be the princess… so imagination goes wild. My 10 month old really enjoyed the baby/toddler area, especially the little carrousel. It’s nice that each location is different, but the coffee stays the same, delicious as always!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yana Cucias\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Another new beautiful location! This location is my absolute favorite! So grand and such a beautiful design! Just keeps getting prettier and prettier 💕 love the all white,and how spacious it is. You get a bigger eating and sitting space. There coffee is always top notch! Bathrooms are very well maintained.\nVery clean and organized👌🏻My kids always enjoy coming here 😊 and so do I!  Love having birthday parties here! I would definitely recommend ✅\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karthik Krishnamurthy\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: It provides a highly engaging and entertaining environment for children, offering a diverse range of activities that effectively capture their attention. The two-hour time limit is sufficient and seems to pass swiftly due to the captivating nature of the activities. The materials utilized for play are predominantly safe, alleviating concerns for parents. Additionally, the presence of a cafeteria further enhances the overall experience.\n\nKarthik K\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B Full\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My daughter had the best party here!

Whoever designed the play areas has kids and kids in mind. There's something around every corner for their enjoyment. Spacious (a plus). For us germaphobes, they clean and sanitize A LOT.\nA separate play area for crawlers-3yo and a seating area to watch them. Everything is cushioned.\nThe eating area has plenty of space to camp your gear. Kid friendly food and snacks and drinks to buy. For adults, they make Belgian waffles and crepes and more. I did not look at the menu extensively for my first visit but saw many people chowing down.\nI was really pleased with the experience and cost for value (2hrs, $15 per kid) and you get a punch card.\nPro Tip: Go online and fill out Waiver Form information before your first visit.\nWe will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yancy Guzman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We just celebrated our boy’s 5th birthday and I could cry at the thought of how much fun he had.

It is also gated and very very CLEAN!\nMy only feedback (for safety) would be to place a 1-kid limit sign or monitor the entrance to that stretchy climbing area, kids were running and jumping from the top clear bridge into the middle, falling through each tier and forcefully landing on top of other kids.\n\nI also want to add that I absolutely loved the  Christian music they played while we were there, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Theresa Hemingway\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 5 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing!

But good for germs I guess.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittney Maxwell\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We visited Play Land, a playground advertised for kids ages 1–10. My nieces are both 10 years old, they are twins, but we were told they couldn’t play because they “looked older/they were about to turn 11 in 2 months and there were many younger children playing that day so they weren’t comfortable letting them play” The manager claimed the owners had recently changed the policy and that it was listed on the website—but after checking thoroughly, there was no such information online or posted anywhere in the facility.\n\nWhile the manager said she was just doing her job, the situation was frustrating and humiliating. My nieces were made to feel out of place and judged based on appearance alone, despite being within the stated age range. They were eventually allowed to play, but the damage was done—it was an upsetting experience that no child or family should go through.\n\nDiscrimination based on how a child looks rather than their actual age is not acceptable. Clear communication and respectful treatment should be a priority, especially in spaces meant for kids. We have been coming here for months and are truly saddened by our experience today. I understand there was most likely a situation that happened that put smaller children in danger, that the manager/owners started a policy of gaging whether a child was fit to play or not based on there looks, but I am appalled by the treatment we received by this establishment today.\n\nReplying to owners response.\n\nThank you for your response, but the manager was not going to let my nieces play yesterday until I drove home the fact that they were 10, so I could understand her reasoning.  I told her multiple times they were 10 and she proceeded with what I stated earlier about their size. My response to was regardless of there appearance, they are 10 yrs old and not 11 yet, and she stated if they are close to turning 11 then your policy is that they can’t play if you feel they would be a threat to younger children. There was no confusion on what transpired. I just continued telling her they were 10 and she said that she can make an exception this one time. I realize when they turn 11 they will no longer be able to play, that was not the issue.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olesea Mironyuk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 days ago\nReview: A Perfect Spot for Kids and Parents!\n\nWe recently visited Playland Pineville with our 8 year old son and his best friend, and it exceeded all our expectations. From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how clean, bright, and thoughtfully designed the space was. The indoor playground is spacious and full of creative play zones — from climbing structures and slides to sensory areas and imaginative play corners. Everything felt safe and well-maintained, which gave us peace of mind while the kids explored.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart for patents is the café. Me and my husband enjoyed an iced matcha and a hot tea… drinks were soooo good.\n\nThe staff were friendly, attentive, and clearly passionate about creating a fun, safe environment.\n\nWhether you’re looking for a rainy-day activity or a fun outing where both kids and adults are happy, Playland is a fantastic choice. We’ll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yuliya Gusar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This location is nothing short of amazing! It was an absolute delight! From the moment we walked in, the clean and neat environment made a great first impression. The layout is spacious and open, allowing for easy navigation and plenty of room for the kids to explore.\n\nThe variety of play structures kept my children entertained for hours. They had so much fun that they were genuinely upset when it was time to go home! As a bonus, the coffee served at the café was delicious. It was a treat to enjoy a nice cup of HOT coffee while the kids played happily.\n\nThe owners truly make Playland special! They put in so much effort to create a welcoming atmosphere. Their dedication to maintaining the playground shines through in every detail.\n\nOverall, Playland is an inviting and enjoyable space for both kids and parents. We’ll definitely be returning!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julia Kornivska\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Awesome place for kids!

They are very nice people and they have great customer service. There were two individuals that stuck out the most that was very helpful. One of the associates even went up and got my son out of the top of the play area, cause he was scared. Her name was Teagan, she was also the one that helped me check in with me and my son arrived by scanning the barcode. She is awesome. There was another individual name Andrea she had great customer service as well. She rung us up at the register for lunchables and a juice box. Definitely will be taking my son back to the establishment. It is a awesome place and I highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Burch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Very nice and clean.

This location is very clean and overall a joyous place to be! There is so much to do, from swings and slides to climbing and crawling- my child always has a blast. I also like that the parents are allowed to join their child on the playground unlike some places, that don’t allow parents to be on stuff. Allowing me to be by my child’s side while we slide down into the ball pit or climb and explore really makes the whole experience special and we enjoy playing together. Thank you for offering us a fun and safe place to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: rachel cost\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We had the most amazing time at Playground and Cafe!

However, today’s experience was a complete let down & we will not be back to this location.\nThe staff is NOT friendly like the other locations (one in particular was constantly YELLING at some younger boys)… these are kids coming in, yes, keep them safe & tell them the rules by all means… but yelling at them the way she did was completely uncalled for (if it was my kid she was talking to I would have said something). The manager was even rude to me when my gift card wasn’t working… just not the same vibe/friendly staff as the other two locations.\n\nEdited to add a response to the “owners” comment below:\n\nYour response to our experience is very disappointing and further confirmation we will no longer be loyal customers. I was not disrespectful by any means & was simply explaining to your manager it was in fact a gift card granted from one of your other locations. Now accusing me as the customer of fraud when I happily paid for our entrance when they couldn’t figure it out is exactly the reason we will not be giving this location or any of your locations our business. This all could have been handled in a professional manner and the least you as an owner could have offered to do would be to check into the gift card situation further. Instead you jumped to an extreme conclusion that this was somehow a fraudulent gift card without being present to even know the background information.\n\nIn regard to your employee, it was not only the time when everyone was asked to leave the ball pit for cleaning but several other occasions when kids were “breaking rules.” Correcting the children was not the problem but choosing to snap at them is not called for and an environment your guests should have to experience with Christian music playing in the background.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Timothy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Excellent layout. Not too big that the kids get lost, but not so small that it's cramped. Very friendly environment with great food and drinks! Best of all, the owners are Christians and have no shame about it. We will definitely be coming back with our kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrea Finch\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: The playground/facilities itself is great coffee at the cafe were great. Booked online ahead of time as it was suggested on website for weekends for the available time. When we arrived the place was packed!!! I really don’t see the point in booking for a specific time since place was overcrowded. They have tricycles for kids to ride around and although the idea is great kids using them just kept bumping and running over peoples feet, in my opinion a hazard specially as busy as the place was on Saturday.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ceyleen Navarro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The indoor play gym of my childhood dreams! Instead of old French fries and smelly feet it smells like gourmet coffee and waffles. It’s so spacious so even if you need to follow your kid into the playground there’s more than enough space. I love the gated off section for the little ones. Very well planned and thought out. Will go back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexi Bickler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Blown away by the facility and staff. Excellent customer service, food, and amenities. We love Playland Monroe and are so thrilled to have this one closer to our home! They didn’t have their punch card running yet at this location (as of 10/14/24) but said they’d double punch us next time we come in!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danya Ortiz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: I've been to a lot of play places and this one by far has the most bang for your buck. Good for all ages. Has one of the most engaging toddler areas that isn't just baby stuff, and very unique and fun climbing equipment. Definitely recommend and I will be back. 😁 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sarah brown\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We had a private table today for our son’s second birthday and it was a great time!

A separate area for kids ages 3 and younger.  LEGO play area, swings, slides, trampolines and other fun, Party rooms.\n\nYou can also enjoy delicious coffee and food.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather P\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Sooo awesome! We love it and I even have fun going into the playground with my 1.5 year old it’s nice that it’s big enough and there’s spots I can stand up in there! The toddler area is also great! The coffee is also delicious! My only feedback is I wish there were healthier snack/food options for littles\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Destiny Eddings\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Didn't like that older kids were playing in the baby/toddler area.

The coffee was also very overpriced for the quality, it was not good at all.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Omar Plumey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My toddler, wife, and I had a great time here.

Easy to keep an eye on the kids whilst giving them space to run free.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Pender\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We came here on a Monday just before 11am and the place was insanely busy. We were put on a waitlist (understandably) because they don’t take reservations during the week. I hope this place reconsiders how many children are allowed at one time as it was extremely overwhelming as a mom of two young children. My son got upset a few times because he couldn’t find me as I was with our youngest. The pros- the place is very cute, and my kids had a blast and it does look clean and employees were walking around. Just not sure if I’ll be back soon as we are pretty far and I don’t want to risk it being this busy again and if I can’t make a reservation during the week.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: V B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: Staff was not very attentive.

It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandi Sparks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: KC McGinley McNally\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This location is PERFECT for little kids.

I would not recommend for older than 4+ as it would bore them fairly quickly (IMO). Snacks, hot dogs & quesadillas, plus all kinds of beverages. Very friendly staff!

I brought my daughter on her birthday last year and I brought her again today for her birthday this year. Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it’s just perfect. I need to come here more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joe H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Absolutely Amazing!\n\nPlayland is hands down the best indoor playground and café we’ve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Essence Champion\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space! My 3yo, 6yo, and even 9yo very much enjoyed their time. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. The food options are fresh and plentiful. Children are kind to each other. Lovely first experience, would definitely go back:)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ethan Sallaz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 months ago\nReview: Everything is very clean and workers are visibly cleaning throughout the day. The play equipment was appropriate size for the kids but big enough for adults to navigate along with their child. The cafe has a variety of snacks for kids and adults and the drink coolers prices were reasonable.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility. I really appreciate the staff always cleaning while we are there. The cleanliness doesn't go unappreciated on our little family's behalf. We love it here! Very friendly, professional, and laid-back environment. Of course we will continue to be returning Playland family 💕 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Caspento\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 and 2 year old love this indoor play place! Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pat Elenowitz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My granddaughter had her 6th birthday party at this facility.  Everything was perfect. As soon as I walked in, I could smell the cleanliness. It felt good just to know that they take care to make sure everything is clean. The kids had an awesome time. We had the room upstairs. It worked out perfectly.  The staff was helpful and courteous.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff. Love that your own socks can be worn and adults can be on all the equipment to help their Littles. It is a nice, clean  and affordable facility for a good play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.  The cafe has delicious drinks and snacks as well.  Definitely a 10/10.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquia James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had a chance to take my 2.5 yr old to Playland while visiting family in Charlotte. She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stacey Scanlon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Loved it here! It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea J.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: 10/10 recommend Playland Lake Norman’s MAGICAL play space and cafe!

Neither of which were done except sweeping by the staff after the fact . My dad didn’t get to enjoy the party due to watching our food platters and dessert tables from a known ant issue . I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive. My children and I visit here frequently and I typically speak highly of this place but we won’t be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Frye\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Since outside snacks and food aren’t allowed, I wish the owners would offer healthier options. The little muffins are HORRIBLE for you, as well as some other snacks here for purchase. Please offer options with no preservatives and chemicals. Other than this, the place is totally fine!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Fia Fair\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: that was such a exuberant experience!!! mallory, saray, juliette and savannah are all SO sweet and attentive! i highly recommend going, had the most delicious waffle in years :3 they have a really fun menu!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittanie Holder\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Love this place, Statesville doesn't have anything fun so I take my kids here to have some fun and I love the cafe and food choices they have here.

I’d recommend!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine Z\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I like this place and my daughter does too but the only bad thing is the kids menu like others mentioned there’s lil to no food for them only some snacks and you can’t bring in food.  So if you can’t bring food in have better options. Everytime we go there there’s only one thing food wise available for the kids the full menu is never available, according to the people working.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M.

Clean and aesthetically appealing for the parents. Minus one star because this play cafe is Expensive. I paid $19 for one child, they surge the pricing on the weekends, after that forget about it if you want a coffee or need to buy your kid a snack.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatriz Requejo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best coffee in town!

My toddler loved it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was the perfect place to enjoy a couple of hours of active play with my two toddler granddaughters! (Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Hardin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Absolutely love this place my five-year-old and my three-year-old have had the best time in the world.

Kept the girls busy the entire time! So affordable...and great selection of food, drinks and snacks. The waffles are delicious and the coffee is better than Starbucks! The staff is great. They come out and clean like every 15 minutes, wipe everything down, vacuum the floors and benches, one of the staff even played with a small child who wandered over while she was cleaning. We will definitely be a frequent customer!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Powell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really happy with our first visit and we will be back. My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted. We purchased tickets and filled out the waiver online so we had no wait checking in. The cafe was convenient to the play area and had a lot of items for adults and kids; staff were attentive; and the bathrooms were tidy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ramon Castillo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We went this past weekend and we had waffles and coffee. Great taste and reasonable prices!\nMy daughter loves this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Debby Cole\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Super fun place! Our toddler enjoyed it. Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing. So just be aware there’s lots of germs floating around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Holly Hicks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time going to the Mooresville location with my two year old and he absolutely loved it!

We had kids ranging from toddlers up to 8 year olds and the playground was great for all. The coffee was delicious, reasonably priced and the staff were so polite. Wonderful environment; we will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: anna tilley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for little ones! My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The price was reasonable and the amount of time allowed is just enough to tire the kiddos out! Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: juliya melnichuk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Today was our first time visiting this new location. We didn’t desire to leave! It’s so cute, clean, and their friendly staff are always rotating to sanitize the playground. I love that there are two bathrooms here. The place is an absolutely beauty from the clean modern bathrooms to an aesthetically pleasing playground and play kitchen 😍. One of my favorite things about this business that I share with everyone is the check in process and the fact the you can see the playground from almost every sitting area! The entire playground is gated in and the staff is very watchful for everyone’s safety. Also… if you ever get a chance to meet the owners, you will learn they are the kindest and genuine people. This is a small family business that I will always support!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miracle Man\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Nice play it does get crowded on weekends many kids and it does look like they clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: August yeager\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: This was our first time here and we really liked it! There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Prichard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brought my 5 year old here today and she LOVED it. Lots of levels to climb, slides and a large ball pit. There is a kids cafe for quieter play and space for birthday parties. Huge waffles, hot dogs, quesadillas, snacks, smoothies and coffee. During the time we were here, I saw staff continuingly cleaning all the play spaces, including getting into the large enclosure. Definitely would recommend and will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J McCallum\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We absolutely love this place! Such a fun environment for kids and moms for a playdate or to make new friends. The staff is friendly and I love the commitment to cleanliness they have, it makes you feel comfortable to let your kiddos play to their hearts content.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leah H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This is the perfect place for your little ones. There is so much for them to do from slides to ball pit, kitchen play, magnablocks, ball pit, ride on toys. I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bria Argrett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love playland! Always so clean, perfect for your little ones for indoor play. So much to do to keep them busy. Also the coffee bar and snacks are perfect!

Delicious Coffee at the Cafe too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid. Even the very small kids.\n\nThere are plenty of tables to sit.\n\nThey have coffee and snacks like waffles, hot dogs and potato chips.\n\nParking is easy, they have plenty of space outside.\n\nPerfect activity for when is too hot outside.\n\nIf it is not too busy you don’t need a reservation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank u for the best afternoon. In spite of rainy & cool weather, we had a blast! Wonderful peppermint mocha, as well!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin McGinty\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We are so happy this place opened! The girls that work there are so kind and helpful. I LOVE that they check your sticker against your child's sticker on the way out and when I lost my sticker, the young woman working at the desk was asking my son \"is this your mommy?\" lol super cute and you can never be too safe! One day we were there and the side door alarm went off. I was happy no child escaped and that the alarm actually did its job. Kids can roam free without fear of losing them as you can walk around the playland; there are only a couple of small places where you may not be able to visualize them, but an adult can definitely get to those places if need be. There were the occasional kids that were on the more rambunctious side but the parents (so far) seem to do a great job of reeling them in. The bathrooms were clean and the snacks and coffee were fresh. Yeah the cafe is a little pricey but that is the price you pay to give yourself a little enjoyment while you watch your kids have a great time or get some work done on your laptop. This place would be best for walkers through about 5/6 year-olds. Lots of little toys/walkers/cars for toddlers, a sectioned off play room, and sensory board. I did see a couple kids eat-it on the slide but that is just what happens when they want to walk down the slide and not sit lol. Everything is padded and kids were still taking nose-dives/face-planting and did not seem physically harmed. It gets pretty busy and seating can be limited but otherwise we will keep coming back until he outgrows it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan DiPace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Playland is a huge win for our community!

Staff is 10-10!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: courtney ohlsen\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who’s new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veronica Escuadra\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We love going to Playland! My toddler has so much fun here!

The little sections for play are adorable with a little kitchen, tool zone, animal/vet area, police/fire station.

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy.

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!!

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group.

An amazing team, beautiful space, and a stress free day.

All we had to do was show up the day of the party and it was ready for us and all our guests, who had an amazing time. Can’t recommend them enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Suraj Nagarji\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: The place is cute, however when we rented the front and back out for a 2 hour party, they were starting to clean up and put food up 15 minutes before the end of the party. They were removing table cloths and taking down decor, like the expensive balloon garland we also purchased from them. In addition, they didn’t warn the kids that the bounce house was going to be deflated, also before the end of the party. There was no party after us, so\nI don’t see why they’d need to be in such a rush. I paid for 2 hours of a birthday party and they very rudely cut it short. I have told everyone not to waste their money on a party at this location. The owner and whoever was working that day were extremely rude.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carla Burgos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Today I visited with affordable prices. A very cozy place, ideal for small children. In fact, the ages are from 1 to 5 years old. It is very beautiful. My daughter loved it. At the other end, they have an activity area to celebrate birthdays and any desired activity is very large. I recommend it. visit this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: If you’re looking for a beautiful venue to celebrate your special occasion, without having to sell a kidney, look no further! We recently held my daughter’s Sweet 16 Birthday party here and Andrea & Kathy totally exceeded my expectations. They were both extremely kind and easy to work with and offered great advice to elevate the decor within my budget. Their decorations were beautiful and my daughter (and her guests) were pleased with how everything turned out. These ladies have an eye for detail and they decorated the immaculate event space so beautifully. They honestly felt like family by the end of the party. I can’t recommend Confete Soiree and Play enough. Stop by and see for yourself!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tyra Harrison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Andrea and Lauren were nothing short of amazing! There were 2 party attendants on site to help set up and break down along with endless activities for the kids. Her and her team were able to make my daughter’s 1st birthday one to remember! I highly recommend!!! 10/10 experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Evans\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I had the pleasure of working with Andrea and her team to host/decorate for my daughter's first birthday party. Let me tell you, the experience was PHENOMENAL!! Preparing for a first birthday party is stressful, but the team at Confete made the planning completely stress free and seamless! Every idea and thought I had for the decor and theme they supported and brought to fruition perfectly. I also love how they deep clean the entire event space to ensure extreme cleanliness and safety for the kids; like literally hand wiping/sanitizing every object in the event space....for an OCD mom like me, it was awesome to see this. I can't thank them enough for executing my vision for my daughter's party. Everything was absolutely beautiful!!! Follow them on Instagram to see just how awesome they are!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maket El\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Superb experience with this venue! The staff were epically supportive. The staff had everything we needed and more and were so welcoming and friendly! The facility was clean and so well organized. The service level far exceeded our expectations and I highly recommend this location to everyone who needs a space to host children. The kids had a blast and the staff truly treated us like family. Confete Soiree helped to carry out our special day, beautifully!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lori\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Please take the $10 I gave your company today and buy a new lock for the play area gate. The gate does not lock automatically and it is very difficult to manually lock. If you are not going to replace the lock, please ensure someone is standing at the gate making sure children do not get out of the gate as the gate is intended to ensure childrens safety. I do not recommend for children under 2 as the jungle gym may be very difficult for them to navigate alone. The play area was clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sips with SYD\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had my daughters first birthday here back in February the staff was amazing and helpful, and the kids had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Arra Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We have visited a few times and have loved it!

Andrea and Lauren were so kind and helped me think about all the little details. When planning a first birthday, it can feel so overwhelming thinking about everything but luckily Andrea was kind enough to answer all of my questions along with suggest beautiful ideas for our event. During the event Lauren was able to efficiently and quickly help all of our guests with signing the waivers and getting their grip socks to begin playing. Everyone was so happy about the service and the space that more of our friends mentioned wanting to be do events there as well. We’re so incredibly lucky to have found Confete Soirée when we did!

It was AMAZING! The owner Andrea and her staff are wonderful, pleasant and prompt people to work with. They are honest and true people to work with. Please disregard all negative reviews! This is a fantastic place for kids of all ages to have fun and practice their skills as well as have active play. Parents can also enjoy themselves as well. Definitely an awesome play date spot! I loved how quick Andrea was to understand my needs and the day of we recieved so much help setting up. Birthdays can be a stressful time but I was not stressed at all working with this crew. The talent is unmatched! On top of the facility, her eye for design is a must have for any themed parties. You won't get custom designs anywhere else! Thank you so much Andrea & the team!!! We had a blast!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Sector\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We went on the Monday after the Superbowl for the first time.

We'll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ursula N\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Many thanks to Confete Soirée for ensuring my daughter’s baby shower was a beautiful, memorable event. Capturing her amazement at the decorations and setup was a touching moment.  From the listening ear, recommendations, and execution, I can’t express enough my sincere enjoyment in working with Andrea, Ari, and the extended team.  They went above and beyond to incorporate every intricate detail and design for the shower.  The level of genuine kindness that was shown to my family will be forever imprinted in my heart.  As Maya Angelou once said: “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel”!  Thank you for making my family and I feel special through your passion of creativity, professionalism, and warming personalities.  Looking forward to having more events at Confete Soirée!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krystina Broome\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time at confete soirée and it didn’t disappoint. Staff was very friendly. This is a great space for young kiddos. My littles are 2.5 years apart, and they both were entertained for over two hours. The area is closed off which is nice for little ones still figuring things out. It’s big enough but not too big! Great place for any day but especially a rainy or cold day. Will def go back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ludwing Vivas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Alexa Ghiz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I brought my daughter here for open play and we had the best experience! The staff were so nice and were super sweet to my daughter.\n\nThe play area is very clean and well kept. The toys were fun and engaging, the foam ball pit was a blast and the play structure was the best.\n\nThis is a great place for young children, and I highly recommend it. Their instagram wall also has the most beautiful pics from their parties. I’m planning to book a party here for my daughter.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We truly had the most amazing experience here! I cannot say enough good things about this space and the people who work here. We have been multiple times just to play but their birthday party hosting skills are the best and you will not find a better place or group of people to work with. We hosted my daughters 2nd birthday here and they truly went above and beyond. They made the day perfect and I really got to just enjoy the time celebrating my little girl as they were so helpful from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It was such an enjoyable time celebrating my 2 year old with all her friends and my husband and I both agree that we will plan to hopefully have her party here every year until she outgrows the space.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Junoothejeweler\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So I walked in today inquiring about an event that may have 26 individuals (not all kids of course) and the owner I’m assume looked me up and down as if I disgusted her by having tattoos and being an African American, she decided not to speak and continued to look on her phone for the whole interaction and when a nice individual who ACTUALLY referred me came from the back and gave me the info I needed I then proceeded to mention that if was able to be done on a week day that I will pay whatever additional cost there was and the wonderful lady by the name of Ari looked at the sad excuse of an owner for input on the offer I gave she continued to scroll on her phone as if I was just a waste of a human being while a mother and son was in the establishment at the time … Im just glad my family didn’t witness this because I myself feel terrible and it really bothers me that this is what gets rewarded to people who just want to help another local business owner and to YOU THE \"OWNER\" no we were not there to rob or scope the place out  #I THOUGHT ALL LIVES MATTERED\n\nP.S. I am also a business owner and I am ashamed to be the same title as someone with such disrespect and disregard for another human being\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tran Linh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I dont know what happened recently that this place has been slammed with negative reviews but I have had overall good experience there. My kid loves the place and never wanted to leave. We follow the rules and the place felt clean. It’s small enough for me to not worry about my kid got hurt.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: amy ralton\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I wish I could rate this place in the negatives, as my experience left me traumatized even as I type this review. It took me some time to gather the courage to share my experience, but it's important to address what went wrong. Despite a friend's words against this company I still went by, my visit to this store a couple of weeks ago was nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nThe staff's behavior was shockingly rude, and the atmosphere was incredibly unpleasant. I felt racially profiled during my visit. I strongly advise against bringing your children here, as you may risk them experiencing the same distressing treatment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ggr ere\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a spam post, please disregard.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Clark\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter's 3rd birthday party here over the weekend.

The owner, Andrea was amazing to work with. Not only is she incredibly sweet and accomodating but has magnificent talent in decorating. We were parked outside her newly installed glass garage doors facing one the event room. The chandelier decorations were stunning and her balloon installations adorned the whole room.  If you are booking a party for your child or having an adult party, you won’t be disappointed! They are AMAZING!

Great for my 6month , 2 and 4 year old . Love how everything is wooden , it was very clean. My kids loved the play area and having wall activities and blocks to play on and even some cute ride on items . It’s cute little area for parents to sit at and watch your children play . We really enjoyed it and can’t wait to go back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angela Foster\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is a gem for little ones!!

Perfect for littles to play in a safe space designed for them. Super clean and fun.

We just check the new location today and my kids love it. I have a 2-year-old (boy) and a 3 years old (girl). They really like the playground area and the ball pit. Also, has an area for parents to sit and watch them, but let them play independently. My girl wants to do her Bday party here, so we are considerate of it. All the staff is super nice and friendly with the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jeff Tanghe\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cindy Ewing\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Very fun and engaging place for my 2.5yo\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aurianna Houseman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Love this place!

They have a small café area where you can order a variety of snacks and drinks while your kids play and for them to enjoy as well. They have 4 rooms for parties that seem to be a good size and a large area at the front with a lot of tables for both kids and adults to use. Tons of climbing areas, a ball pit, trampolines etc for kids to choose from. My daughter loves the carousel swing while my son's favorite is the trampoline area. There are a couple spots with big screen tvs that play kid-safe/friendly shows too. It's a great place for them to burn energy and have fun for a couple hours.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessi Harper\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place was fantastic!

However, it has issues. First of all the food/kitchen menu is basically fake. In theory, they serve both coffee and hot food, but in reality, there's never actually staff to prepare it. I've been here 10+ times. Just don't expect any food except packaged snacks.\n\nSecondly, why is there a huge movie screen playing cartoons??? Who thought this was a good idea at a playgym? If I wanted my toddler to sit and watch Disney movies, we do that at home for free.\n\nToo bad for these poor management decisions. High Five could be great! But right now there is zero reason to visit when you can drive 10m down Independence & go to Playland instead.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cintya Calix\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: s jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Great birthday party location.

They do, however, need to work on logistics. We arrived 30 minutes before start time and they said we needed to wait until 15-20 minutes prior—no problem. The email stated we’d have a room attendant which we did not have. No grip socks included for my party guests. The food came and no one announced or told us it was there so by the time the kids got to it—it was cooling off. The same happened with their sweet treats at the end. No announcement, no notifying the parents—just dropped it off to melt and walked off. The only time someone came and communicated directly with me was at the end when they wanted me to check out and pay them. For the prices they charge they should be way more accommodating to families hosting parties. If you’re going just for kids to play 6 and under it’s a good option with accessibility for the smaller kids. I’ve hosted multiple kids parties and this was the least impressive experience on that front.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Michel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristal King\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great spot for kids! We went recently for a 2 yr olds birthday party and everyone has a good time. There's something to do for kids of pretty much all ages... my 18 month old enjoyed herself just as much of my 9 year old. It can be a little chaotic as kids can run around independently while parents can choose to watch from the sidelines. So you just have to be extra watchful of the smaller kids to make sure the bigger ones dont run them over. The location would have been hard to find of the party host didnt specifically tell everyone it was behind the At Home store, because if you simply type the address in the GPS you would end up at the front door of the At Home store. Overall it was a great time, I would visit again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jana Swift\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great for my 10 year old and my 18 month old.

However when you book a party (which is very expensive)they expect you and all your guests to be out of the entire facility in the two hour window. They also failed to put the correct amount of chairs knowing the number of guests that had signed in about an hour prior to seat for pizza and cake. The number of chairs was not updated in time. One of my guests felt left out because they took a long time to bring the chair and the little one stepped out crying. It was not a fun experience for my guest and I’m very unhappy about that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Nnene Okeiyi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Great birthday experience for the kiddos.

Large spaces, tons of slides, ball pits, trampolines. Took off a star because it was freezing! All parents were wearing jackets, our kids’ hands and feet were cold. Granted I went soon after they opened and it is a very large space , however  someone should get there earlier and make sure the place is appropriately heated before opening. I paid for 2 hours, but ended up leaving after the first unfortunately because of the cold. We will be back on a warmer day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thornheezy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Good time for both my kids (age 3 and 6).

Definitely will be coming back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cassandra Freitas\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Not worth the money 👎🏻 biased because I’ve been to other indoor playgrounds, and this was most definitely at the bottom of my list. Parents aren’t allowed to go down the beautiful big slide they have and that really threw me for a loop since my child wanted to go down together. There was also paper signs multiple places saying that adults couldn’t go on or use areas as well as other paper signs to not lean on furniture etc. This just tells me you bought cheap furniture but charge an expensive price to get through the door. Not to mention, the cafe was not stocked with any food or snacks in the cases and when asked for a cup of coffee well over an hour before their closing time, we had been told the machine was already shut down for the day. They only offer 2 hour passes and within 30 minutes of not being able to join my toddler on things, we were ready to go but stayed since we had already paid for it. I’m sure people enjoy it here but in my opinion, spend your money elsewhere. The place was also clean, which was nice. The gate at the front had been left open a couple times and had to keep redirecting my toddler to not run away.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cynthia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: They keep it clean\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DA Bhatt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Nice place to have a birthday party or just day out for toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bill Hawks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was incredible for my 2 year old daughter. I’d say it’s a perfect indoor play area for kids under 7 years old. They had equipment for balancing, climbing obstacles, swinging and rotating equipment, tiny trampolines, ball pits, and a really cool jungle gym with three slides. Everything is soft sided so you can feel good about kids trying new things without getting hurt. Didn’t try any food or anything, but was impressed with how much my kid enjoyed it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen van Bergen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mack Mizzle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Beautiful place for toddlers and little kids to play and explore\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yasiel Barroso\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: The playground boasts vibrant colors, clean, well-maintained, and modern equipment, ensuring fun and safety.

Definitely recommended for a family weekend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Iyana Rushing\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Nice place to play for toddlers, not worth $20 though. I’d also examine the ball pits while your child is in it. There was a huge living spider in the smaller ball pit for 2 and under it looked like, luckily my 2year old seen it and notified me before anyone was bitten. Hopefully they clean out the ball pits regularly to make sure there aren’t any insects living beneath.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vivian Pan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: The environment is OK, but don't use the vending machine in the store, when you pay no product comes out.

My children are 1 year and 4 years old. Both kids had a great time. The playground was built in such a way that I could always visually make sure that everything was fine with my eldest and that she was having a great time, while I stayed close to my youngest daughter the whole time. Clean, beautiful, lots of fun for children. For two children it turned out to be about $35 for 2 hours, which is above average, but the day was cloudy, and most importantly the daughters had a great time.\n\nYou can book your time online, but it is not necessary. The first time I booked, the subsequent ones came simply when they wanted to play. But in the second case, it is worth considering that if the site is overcrowded, you may be refused, which has never happened to us.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Jennerich\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Pretty cool place for kids. Plentybof space for a party or if you just bring one child. There are ball pits, slides, mazes, and other things to climb. There is an area for smaller toddlers to play as well. Every surface is soft so no problem if anyone falls down. They have 4 private birthday rooms. Grownups are allowed to play too. They just can't go on the trampolines or slides.I recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: IURII ORLOV\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Super👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️ …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: bobbie Berke\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Ridiculously cold (manager says it’s set at 68).

It is difficult to find a place where infants and toddlers can play safely; this place fills that void.

We took our 1 year old here and our 7 year old year. Both had an amazing time.\n\nThey are very welcoming and constantly cleaning!\n\nMy only suggestion would be quick snacks, and also, if they had music playing, that would've elevated the experience. Nonetheless, it was a great time, and I would definitely definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ernie Torres\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Nice clean place. Courteous staff. Slightly hidden in the corner behind the home store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jada Jackson\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came to High five for an afternoon play date. We had a blast! We went around 4PM on a Friday. Everything was clean. Even made me more excited to see people actively cleaning as we were playing. The only reason I took off one star is because the price is a bit steep for a 2 hour playtime. I only brought one of my two kids but I can’t imagine a family paying for more than 2 kids. This place is definitely geared to kids 10 and under. They have little baby sections for little ones to play on. Socks are required which is great! Hand sanitizer stations posted everywhere and lots of spaces for parents to sit out and chill. Even a place for parents who need to charge their phones, use their computers, or even moms to plug up to pump. They also have a cafe that serves food. We were going out to eat afterwards so we didn’t get to use those services. It overall we enjoyed and though the price is higher than others, we will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Noel\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The establishment is clean, and maintained well, it was not very busy today which was nice,   Removed stars for not having any saftey measures for kids leaving with correct adults and the gate to the exit was not consistently shut either and the front door wouldn’t completely shut either   … when we got here it was so hot inside everyone was sweating even people sitting down- I personally bumped the ac to a comfortable level bc no employees were… overpriced, (15 min down the road I can pay half of what I pay for 1 here )-  the food options are not healthy at all,   And there are tvs in multiple spots ….  Which for some would be a  non issue but for people bringing kids who are screen free the kids just stare at the tv and video game tv  in the ball pit and barely play with the eqpt we overpaid for.  …. Not allowed to go down the slide with the toddler. Means  we now have to keep redirecting away from the slide and this one loves slides. The “little” slides are great for 6-9 month olds, but not 2 year olds.  the spinning car thing has broken pedals  it was not a horrible time, but it def could be better\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kim Hoang\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing for toddlers. It is very clean and very toddler friendly. They have put a lot of thought into protecting all of the potential hazards for a small kid who is just learning how to walk. My toddler really enjoyed it, and the staff was always cleaning. We would highly recommend this place for anyone who has more children, they have a larger area for bigger kids as well. The place is also very aesthetically beautiful. It’s a little hard to find at first since it is behind the home store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: PRONTO AND CARPET LLC\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Hi, thank you for the review!

With a 4 year old, for a few dollars more than Playland, she had a fantastic time. Absolutely loved all the play equipment. It felt pretty clean, was very spacious, had more things that parents could sit on closer to the kids if they needed help, and truly it was worth the extra dollar or two above Playland to not have to drive all the way down there.\nHowever, the one negative thing I would say is that there's absolutely no security measures for the children or parents. There's no name tags to double check and make sure you're bringing your child out with you or someone else's kid. I felt very concerned the entire time that I had to keep a lookout near the door and make sure no creeps had come in.\nWould really appreciate it if you guys have a name system and check on the tags before the parents and children leave. Playland does that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Demetcha Gochette\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hi Demetcha! Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

My son recently had a birthday party there last weekend and we had overall a good experience but I do wish our party host told us to leave in a kinder manner. Our party was over at 12 and we were out of the play area by 12:15. The party room was completely empty by 12 pm. We were on the side where the chairs were by 12:15 gathering last minute things but by 12:20 our party host came to me and told us we had to leave now and was very rude about it. I understand that we were still in the building 20 mins after party time but we were not in the party room or play area whatsoever.. just on the side gathering things and putting kids shoes on. I would understand more if the facility was busier or if we were in anyone’s way but like I mentioned, our party room was empty and the next party hadn’t arrived yet. At 12:20 the building alone wasn’t even as busy as it was 30 mins prior. I’m really big on customer service and I wish our birthday party experience didn't end that way. I also wish they wouldn’t tell us to start packing up 15 mins before our party time ends which cuts us short of our 2hours that we have booked. I wish they had longer slots in between parties to avoid people from feeling rushed to leave.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: uday kumar komaravelli\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Thompson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vidya komaravelli\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shab Yay\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Nice play area but some of the management staff were very rude!! especially to their own employees yelled at a employee right in front of the paid party u was apart of when it was obviously a training issue, I wouldn't recommend booking their over priced party rooms to anyone you won't even get what is listed on the included  oh yea and did I say rude management\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Benjamin Patton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Neibecker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: this was so much fun for my 4 year old! she was able to run in and independently play for 2 whole hours. she made new friends! it was super clean, and there wasn’t anything too scary or complicated that she would have needed my help with. everything was accessible for her (compared to Playland where she needs a lot of support to get where she wants to go). she had an absolute blast and I got a much needed little break!!! we went on a Friday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. it was hard to find but we eventually got there… it’s behind “At Home”!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandy Stroud\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brand new indoor playhouse!

We had brought our son here a few times before and he loved it, so we thought it would be the perfect place for his party.  He and his friends had more fun than I even imagined they'd have.  It's the perfect play area for their age, and there are so many fun things for them to do.  Everyone talked about what an amazing place it was for a birthday party!  We had to drag our son out at the end because he was having so much fun he didn't want it to end.  Haha.  As far as setting the party up, Katina was AMAZING!!!  She was beyond helpful and so incredibly sweet.  I'd do another party there just because of how wonderful she is!  All of the girls working that day were great.

Trampolines, mazes, slides, a swing carousel that the kids absolutely love… they also have ball pits, swings, and rocking toys for the younger ones. Bring a pizza in or utilize the vending machine. Not too big that you’d ever lose track of the kids-you can always spot them.  And Groupon has great discounts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reagan Elizabeth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We love angel island! The best\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dominique Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Angel Island is an amazing place for young kids to play, explore, and have fun! The play structures are well-designed, safe, and perfect for keeping little ones entertained for hours. My daughter and  her friend went for a play date and they enjoyed the variety of activities available, from slides and climbing areas to interactive play zones. Angel Island is a great spot for a playdate or even a birthday party. Highly recommend for parents looking for a fun, safe, and engaging indoor play area!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly Paynter\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Katina at the front desk is so sweet and accommodating.

But this time I have 3 kids with me with this location being smaller i feel so much at ease with being able to see all 3 at the same time.  I will more than likely come here for now on. Everything is nice and clean! All age kids can do something I love this. So glad I found  Angel island fun park.  I have been telling everyone about this place since the first went 6 months ago, beats being outside on cold,rainy, hot days.\n\nI had amazing service from the moment  we walked in thank you to Katina, kyla,Alexa\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalia Garza\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Love this place  Katina was amazing !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molanphy “Thebusyseven” M.M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We love this place, it is perfect to hangout with your kids, they have such great areas, your kids can be playing without any concern, it is super clean and awesome costumer service !

He was big enough to do most things by himself and had an amazing time. We went on a Monday morning and it was not too crowded and proved to be a perfect activity to keep him entertained with plenty of activities for not only this age but for him to grow into over the next few years. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kassie jesrani\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: place is cute , great for kids and amazing customer service.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kari Sheehan\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I went with my 2 year old and she loved it!

They don’t have any staff in the play area looking after the kids.  I saw multiple kids get hurt because rules weren’t being followed.  And they had no one in the party room helping the parents of the party.  Definitely would not have my child’s party at the venue.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nydasia Lewis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My son had a blast !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trina Reese\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the 5-stars Trina!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joanna Guevara\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Love this place for the kiddos , & service is great and welcoming !

That’s a big win for us.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meredith Gray Stone\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Clean, safe atmosphere for young kids. Very friendly and helpful staff.

He had an absolute blast and was able to work off all that energy they have at that age. It was awesome that there was enough space for the adults to be with him in so many of the areas and \"play\" with him. I know we will go back and cant wait for the next time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucy Ganfield\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Good place for young children birthday parties.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savysavege FTW\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We absolutely love this place my toddler has a blast and I can just sit and relax for a few while she runs all her energy out !!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Debbie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Friendly and clean environment!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Warren\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We brought my sons to play with some friends from school while they were tracked out.

It was mostly 3-6 year olds and kids over 8 are not allowed to play here. I think with such a young age group, you should allow parents to go into the play gym to be able to retrieve lost children. I can't see our family returning to any of the locations.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matthew Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Friendly and fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin S.

We went on a Friday afternoon. Not crowded at all. They have several reasonable payment options and a waiver you sign via scanning a bar code or doing it online. We opted for the $20 one-time visit (there's a 59 monthly option or a $72 punch card option plus more options). The $20 one-time play option was good for 3hrs of play! 😎 We also purchased $3 non slip socks, so bring your own and save some cash. They also offer snacks and drinks for purchase (didn't see any hot food options), or I think you can bring your own snack and sit at the tables, check with the store. We did see children with their own water bottles in the sitting area.  I know they told us no food or beverages in the play area. They have a cubby for shoes. Free \"community\" flip flops for bathroom use (must remove your shoes for bathroom use) Im guessing you can bring your own disposable foot coverings if you're uncomfortable using the public flops, ask the store. The restroom was clean and so was the play area - soft padding for little ones. Our 3 year old navigated the play area on his own, under our watchful eyes. Parents can sit at the little tables outside the play area with a full view. The play area is also fenced with open entrances so you can stand and watch your kiddos. There's also two pay-as-you-go massage chairs in the sitting area against the wall - you can relax while getting a massage. If I recall correctly, the cost was about $5 per 10-15 minutes. I believe their website states this play place iso ages 8 and under. Parking was ok but the place is in a small plaza and if they get super busy it looks like parking could be an issue. We enjoyed our time and will be back soon. We recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haley Hufton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I’ve always wanted to try this place but finally got to it today and we will definitely be back!!! Like already planning to go next week!  First off the lady Katina at check in was SO friendly and a bubbly personality. She was so fun to talk to and constantly was cleaning at different times to make sure everything was clean. Which is especially nice to see during the winter months when it’s sick season! I have never seen an indoor play space with the staff this nice and the facility this clean. I loved there was plenty to do for my girls but it wasn’t too big that I was having to run around everywhere looking for them. There’s also a vending machine that has drinks and snacks. Which was a lifesaver when they build up an appetite playing! 10/10 recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maddy Schatzle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Love love love this place!

Yet some 30year old man can chase their kid on equipment. Crazy! Never going again! I brought my 3 yr old and 9 yr old. My 9yr old almost broke out in tears! But she said she would stay for my 3yr old. I thought it looked fine for a 9 yr old but apparently not. I guess I’ll stick to other places instead of a 45 minute drive. To a place I had to watch my 9yr old cry about.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hollie Templeton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great place, friendly staff, clean environment\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Nunley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was so wonderful! Absolutely perfect for my 1 and 3 year old. Also great for a little older also. If you want a place to get them tuckered out this is the place. Mine didn't want to leave.  And the lady at the desk was super kind and helpful with questions.  Definitely gonna become a favorite spot.}",

Bathroom was clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yoselyn Contreras\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I was there today and the workers there give bad service. The brunette girl who is at the cashier looks at you with a face that shows she doesn't like your presence. The same goes for the other blonde-haired girl. Very bad service. The place is beautiful for children.

I will say it’s pricey. $17 to play for two hours is expensive and I don’t think it should be that much in comparison to other places locally / within the state. I will say better attention needs to be added into the 24M and younger area. Yesterday there was a ridiculous amount of older kids in the play area meant for small kids and no parent in sight correcting them until it was to late. The service for drinks is pretty slow they need more staff\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jenna Zayas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Xabiel Garcia (supabadx89)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this for my 2 kids clean and very enjoyable\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Fabian Baez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emma Schaffert\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: What a brilliant little gem! We've been to a few places around the Charlotte area, but this is definitely one of our favorites. The play areas are laid out well, lots of different toys and play equipment for different ages and abilities. We found all of the staff to be very helpful, and the food was great! Highly recommend the chai latte and the empanadas\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nora Woods\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for kids and kids with Autism\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather P\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place. Maybe if the monthly membership was affordable more people would do that and they wouldn’t have to send emails asking people for $20 to “help them keep their doors open” 🤷‍♀️ …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leo Suarez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Save your money. Drive to a better location. Crowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth Lopez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I expected more. Empanadas were very dry and hard, ordered 3 orders between my sister and my friend. I wouldn’t recommend. Ended up throwing most away. My oldest daughter (who is 5) was helping me with my one year old in the under 2 area, and while my oldest was only sitting on the floor not saying a word, asked her to get out of the area since it’s for 2 and under only. I get the rules but it’s not like she was being rowdy or obnoxious she was literally sitting beside her sister.\nAlso, my friend and I came in about 10 mins apart, and my time was up (barely) and we’re already being asked (my friends time wasn’t up yet) if we were leaving or paying another hour. There isn’t a clock in sight. I won’t be back. As much as I wanted to support Latinx owned businesses. 💔\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ASTRID VARGUTI\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super nice place for babies and small children. Everything is super well thought out for your safety and fun. They also have food and coffee for sale so parents can have a pleasant time.\nYou can pay for an hour or more on the spot or online. The first time they ask you to do it online, from their website, but it is very easy.\nThe requirement for children is that they wear grippy socks with rubber bands.\nEven I wanted to be a girl again to enjoy the games ☺️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: caroline cleland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Place is awesome !!

You will need grip socks for the kids, they have them for $4 but I suggest you buy your own since it’s more economical. Posting a pic of the socks so you buy something comparable. Certain grip socks aren’t allowed I don’t believe going by the other reviews. The place is very clean, I went around lunch time on a Friday. Not overcrowded, calm music playing, they have a ball pit and a sandbox which is a plus. Only thing I didn’t like is one of the workers. The light skin mixed looking woman. She reminded me of a prison guard. She is one of the girls making sure we don’t go over our time, she was not friendly at all, no smile, not welcoming. Not sure if she was having a bad day which we all have our days so I get it but you should have a friendly personality if you’re working somewhere involving children. The rest of the staff was very nice! Let me also add if this is your first time going you will need to book online. I suggest doing that before you get there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrigan\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I absolutely loved bringing my toddler here, the relaxing music, coffee, and safe play in enclosed areas!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine Pickford\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I initially wrote a negative review of this place due to a bad experience I had.

They also have the best hot chocolate I’ve ever had!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Riazantseva\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2y.o.had a great time. We came right after opening (they open at 9am which is earlier than other indoor playgrounds and it’s great. I mean kids wake up early lol).\nThe place was really clean, staff was friendly and it was not crowded at all. 1 hour was enough for my child. Coffee and snacks prices are reasonable. We’ll be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R. Brown\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome ! The staff is great ! Parking great . Very clean .

It’s the perfect space to get your kids energy out. Super clean, really organized and the coffee is really good. 100% recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Piquet Ferreira\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: It’s a nice place, albeit a little small. I have a 2 1/2 year old and thought the place would be better suited for younger kids. There’s only one slide, and as expected, some parents are not keeping an eye on their kids, leading to kids climbing up the slide while 3 others are going down. The lack of supervision is not the fault of Unwind, but I do think they should have someone monitoring, instead of having 4 employees hanging out behind the coffee bar. There weren’t enough balls in the ball-pit/slide area.\n\nAlso, you HAVE to buy their socks. We went the Monday after their grand opening and nowhere was it listed that you had to buy their socks. On the way out, they do have a box where you can choose to donate your $4 socks so they can wash and resell. I kept mine. Check-in took forever, but it was only their second day of being open, so I hope they find a better and more efficient way of getting people in quickly.\n\nFYI - they don’t have iced coffee.\n\nUPDATE - so I wanted to give this place another chance. I went to their online site to book a ticket and was absolutely shocked on their new prices. $24.99 for TWO HOURS OF PLAY? I went six months ago and paid $16 for TWO HOURS. That is a $9 increase in six months. That’s a 56% increase in price. I was completely floored and astounded on how crazy expensive it got. Did they add new activities? Are they giving away stuff for free at the door? In 6 months, I don’t know what justifies that. They have outpriced themselves out of the indoor playground market.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carly Garrison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love this place!

Would definitely come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S S\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: $12.99 for one hour of play is very expensive, especially if you are bringing multiple children. My baby had his own grip socks (that were brand new and clean) and the guy at the front desk made me buy THEIR grip socks. For an extra $6. Cost me close to $20 for an hour of play, and that was for one almost 2 year old. My 8 year old daughter was at school and found out that we went and has been begging to go. Unfortunately not with those astronomical prices!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Prachi Tyagi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Highly recommend this place for kids, toddlers and below 2 . Not too much crowded which is why i liked this place the most. No appointment needed if you make a plant last moment.

Would love to visit more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Ball\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you so much for your positive feedback!

I feel like many of the kids were able to enjoy the areas as much as they could. For one hour time slots, I feel like they should have more of a limit on the number of kids per hour and not have the times overlapping so much.\nIt would give the staff more opportunity to keep areas cleaned and the children better enjoyment of the areas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amazing indoor play area!

I brought my three year old and she was definitely the oldest one there. Had no issues bringing our own grippy socks. Paid $3 for a box of horizon chocolate milk.  It is what you make it I guess. My child was happy and that's all that matters.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sasha Vidor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I wish I found this place sooner!! Cheap and fun!\nMy daughter and I absolutely love it! It’s safer than a lot of other places but I love that it caters towards younger kids ages 3 and under.

There are several different areas which results in a fun time for everyone and a very open space so that you can watch all your kids if you have multiple at once in each different area. It is a very calm and fun environment which we enjoyed because most indoor play areas are very loud and overstimulating and the cafe had so many different options for food/drinks for kids and adults. We will be back for sure.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Toben Snow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great time for the kids!

Make sure to make a reservation. They were able to accommodate us as a walkin.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Moody\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: There’s a new rule that even if your child is 7, if they are “too tall” they are not allowed to play. So we arrived and were told my son, who is 7 and has special needs, couldn’t play in the playground even though we had been here before. You can imagine how hard that transition was for us to leave, & with no warning. This is one those discouraging days that will stick with you.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephen Marshall\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place has slipped a bit since they first opened. Unwind is advertised as a sensory play area for all kids, but especially sensitive toward kids with autism.  At the beginning we loved it for exactly that reason. But recently it seems that they do not have any control over the capacity. I went while unbeknownst to me, there was a birthday party going on and that room was packed with people....not to mention the tons of regular customers. There were children well over 7 years old (their limit) running around like crazy people, uncontrolled by their parents and the handful of employees that were there were barely able to keep the balls in the pit because of how out of control these kids were. Aside frome that, small children were getting pushed around as the older ones carelssly ran by them (nothing happened to my 4 year old, thankfully). I feel as if a family should have to rent the whole space out for whatever amount of hours they will be there and not mix other customers in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just found this today!

My son is 3 and definitely was a little too old for this place. My lower rating is for the price! $18.22 for an hour? I thought since the price was so high there would be fewer people. Nope, I could barely walk due to the amount of adults and children. No way could I enjoy a coffee or even sit down at this place. Maybe the weekdays are better?  Also their sock requirement didn’t really make any sense to me. I likely won’t return.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Paloma Michelle\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: My kids have been ill for the past 14 days after a little girl sneezed and coughed directly in my babies face. My toddler almost had to go to the hospital for dehydration from being so ill.\nThere were so many actively and obviously sick children in the play area. The employees are absolutely overrun by the numbers of families there. Seems like the owners would rather have a higher profit than care about screening illness out.\nThe rules are very clear, do not bring sick children. But it is ultimately up to the employees to deny entry to inconsiderate parents who try to bring their sick children.\n\nPosting IG videos of your employees cleaning the equipment isn’t going to do anything when the place is overrun by actively sick children.\n\nDuring Covid, people screened temps and looked for signs of sickness before admitting people into places. I would be perfectly fine with these policies in place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dee\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I think this place is okay. I think if you have a 5 year old or younger it would be great for you. My biggies ick from my this place is the length of time your kids can play. Just 1 hour and the staff literally walk around and tap you and say that your time is up would you like to pay for another hour. I have never had that happen at any other place I’ve ever taken my child so if you have more than 1 child you would be paying almost $60 for 2 hours of play that’s pretty pricey. I think that if an 2 hour minimum was added it would have been better\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christina Smith\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I know this place is near and my son enjoyed it but the price for the time doesn't seem to match. Then they require you to only wear their socks so please don't forget to bring them if returning. My son enjoyed the sand pit but looking around there were some people around with times that should have been up but 5 mins before my time is up staff reminded me if I stayed over 10 mins I would have to buy another hour. There is no discount for buying multiple hours at one time or anything and I couldn't imagine paying the price double. Decent amount of seating but also lots of people which means a lot of standing. The set up seems cheaply made from the fence that's wobbly to the mining wall by the sand pit, and the floor with socks on is hard on your feet.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: BeautywithMarie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely amazing experience here !

Great pastries & coffee too.\nCan’t wait to go back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ally Yusuf\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Edited: Such a salty response from the business owner. I am not a fake account, only a customer and a mom who is looking for a nice experience for my children, as well as support a woman-owned business. But the owner's reply leaves much to be desired. I am a loyal customer with Playland because they run their business well, are kind and welcoming to all customers, and make sure their equipment and play areas are clean and safe. By the way, I was not solicited or asked by Playland to mention their name or wrote a review. They are an honest business and wouldn’t engage in this weird and combative behavior.\n\nSo sorry that the owner cannot be a professional and apologize for the poor treatment I experienced…\n———————-\nWhile my kids enjoyed their play experience, I think charging $12.99 per child for one hour is very expensive, and there were no discounts for siblings.  Also, I felt their equipment was not as sturdy, especially in the baby/24 month area where the climbing thing was loose.\n\nI ordered some items from their cafe, and they forgot to charge me for the water. While I was feeding my 2 year old, I was not aware that my hot chocolate was ready. An employee came to me and brought a credit card reader and said “we forgot to charge you for the water, please pay.” I was shocked because I was frazzled as I was feeding my toddler while trying to watch my other kids. They said I had to go to the counter to pay. I told them I had to feed my kid, and they offered to watch her so I can pay. I didn’t feel comfortable so I had to drag my child all the way to the register - this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. It felt like they wanted to nickel and dime me when it’s THEIR fault. Not coming back again, I am sticking to Playland in Monroe.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sheldon Kovacs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We visit Unwind at least once a week for some good quality play time. Hands down the most toddler friendly play place in town! Sure during peak hours its a bit busy but nonetheless I have to drag my kiddo out every time! We’ve started going later in the afternoons and it’s even more enjoyable for the adults because it’s less crowded! The areas are well cleaned and maintained, the bakery has delicious treats and most importantly my toddler is safe to run around and do all the things! Unwind is the place to be for littles and different ability kiddos!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taja Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Took our daughter for her 2nd birthday and it was a blast! Delicious, inexpensive lattes and treats. I was able to sit and work while she plays in a safe area. The space allows her to explore with little support required. She loves to climb and loves her independence, so it was really the perfect place for her. The staff was so kind and took time out to get to know us as it was our first time. If we lived closer, we would invest in the monthly pass but will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ebony Fisher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love this place!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jorge Zuñiga\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I recommend it.

The host was so helpful when setting up, making coffees, and navigating the art activity. They really made our day go smoothly and easier. The decor they set up was so pretty and perfectly in theme.

Upon entering the cafe, the kids faces lit up with excitement and wonder. They loved the variety of toys and activities. We also used the arts and crafts room and they had a great time drawing some pictures. As for the the adults, we had a warm blueberry muffin and a iced coconut coffee. Both were delicious and very fresh. Thank you for being awesome. The note on my wife's coffee made her day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristal Eastman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Best place for a toddler birthday party!

We loved it. Although my step son was a bit older - he played really well around the small kiddos. I do wish they had a bigger space and had some things for older kids but I love the concept of having a space for toddlers and smaller children. When my baby girl arrives and we need somewhere to go to get out I’ll definitely be bringing her here. The food and drinks were delicious and the owner was so polite! 💓 loved the art room!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: T Fabrizio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Our family loves this location!

But the art area is lacking, the toys are cluttered, and mostly for young kids, and the food and drinks aren’t very good. Overall disappointed, especially if you’re familiar with the Raleigh location.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathleen Adilapuram\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We love spending time at Little Doodles. When the kids are home and I want to get some work done it's so great that we have this option. I'm able to bring the kids guilt free and also get a little bit of work done without ever having to turn on a TV 😊 we love their snack and drink options  also which is convenient. I also love the small events in the evenings which offer moms a chance to meet other moms all while still having the kids entertained.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christian B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This business is a great place to bring the kids to play, make a mess, dress up in their favorite characters and make friends.\nYou have the option to come just with your kids, plan a play date or just relax with your kids playing in a safe space.\nThe fact that this business supports small business is great because there are many different items you can choose from and you know is not a big corporation getting your money but a small local business.\nLDPC offers bday packages and monthly membership benefits.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly Wayman\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shannon Holland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Moreland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: We had out kids' 3rd birthday party here. Things were easy and everyone had a blast! We brought cakes and light snacks. We had Little Doodles decorate and provide eating-ware for a Paw Patrol themed party.\n\nStaff was very helpful in transitioning between playtime, crafts, cake, and presents. During the party, the Cafe was open for purchase and the coffee beverages were quite good (it's not a full cafe setup, but equally yummy).\n\nThere is a large area for tables for parents to sit and a play area along the wall. The play area has a bouncy horse, shopping cart, ice cream vendor, food truck, giant blocks, tent/rock wall, pirate ship, dress up clothes and more!\n\nHighly recommend for both play and party. All the parents commented about how great the setup was. Kids were corralled and it was air conditioned in summer (hello!).\n\nParking was easy as well. Everything was well-orchestrated!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Isaac Lawrence\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Place was awesome!

Jade is such a sweetheart and is the definition of welcoming.  Our kiddo loves the play area and the craft area is always a hit also the have already hosted a ton of specialized events that sell out quick! Plus the drink menu hasn’t disappointed, they sell a variety of kid friendly snack and have baked good from a local baker. Can’t really say enough positive things about this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Lawrence\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Pretty cool place, took my son to a pj mask party hosted by my best friend and it was really nice, the kids all ages were well entertained with paint games, there’s a play yard and there’s a coffee bar you can get coffee and snack while your kid plays. Very awesome\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Pittman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: We absolutely love going to Little Doodles!

My autistic 3-year-old has been coming here since he was crawling, and it has always been such a wonderful experience. The space is safe, fun, and engaging, perfect for little ones to explore and play. The staff here are amazing—so sweet, patient, and kind. They truly make every visit special. It’s hard to find places that feel this welcoming and inclusive, and we are so grateful to have this gem in our community.

I have two toddlers who enjoy the space. They have affordable membership prices as well as day prices cheaper than other places. There are lots of activities for parents that want to guide their children in play, but independent play is safe here.\n\nThere are larger places with climbing equipment, but that is not this type of establishment. Great for a younger kids to socialize and parents who could use a cup of coffee .\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: image capture\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I have been investigating area indoor play spaces with my \"nanny kid,\" 2 y.o. male.\n\nThis is indeed a better option than a place such as Bumble Brews.\n\nOne element that I dislike is the jam-packed play area is so long and thin that it is difficult to keep an eye on him while sitting at a table up front. I propose an adjustment to the layout or more comfortable seating at the back of the space.\n\nHe is still learning so many social skills and etiquette that not being able to see him is a bit anxiety inducing.\n\nAlso, I was never able to get a strong enough wifi signal to do work/research on my laptop.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maira Charry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: All what I can say is that the kids I take care of, really have fun there. they are happy so I do.

It was so adorable that I also decided to throw one of my children’s 3rd birthday party here as well a few months later. It’s perfect for children’s birthday parties, with lots of activities to do. Decorations and food are included, or you can choose to bring your own decorations and food, or a mix of both. They have lots of options for party themes to choose from, and depending on the party package you choose, the children can also do arts and crafts. This is a cozy place and only your guests will be in attendance during your allotted party time. It is a great place for children that enjoy free play, dress up, and arts and crafts. They also have a little cafe so parents can enjoy some coffee during the party. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsay Murdock\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We have always had a great time here - from birthday parties to walk-in play.

Have been here in the past and there were numerous toys such as trucks  and a wall mount and other items for toddlers to have interactive play. Today several items were without batteries and numerous items missing from before… maybe broken or needed cleaning…? Person working was personable however I won’t be back… will go to Marbles Museum or Bumble Brews in Cary… sorry but they have more for children to interact with.. especially for $10.00 a day .. we only stayed for 15 minutes…\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: brooke bell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place was amazing!

It truly feels like a community. Our favorite spot is the art room - it's clear they put a ton of thought into how to make the space special for littles. They also sell local goods/crafts, coffee, kid-friendly snacks. Just a heads up that no outside food drink (besides water) are allowed - purchasing things helps keep the place in business!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sammie Metts\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We are from out of state never seen a place like this!

The Owner & employees I’ve encountered are super kind, inclusive, thoughtful and mindfully conscious of families and their little ones. The cafe and toys are cleaned multiple times a day and is immaculate. They also have Monday Mom’s meetups where I’ve met new amazing friends, a book club, and they host birthday parties!

Most of the toys that were battery operated must not have had batteries or the batteries were dead.\nEdit: Why have battery operated toys if you can’t have batteries?\n2. The worker was on her phone instead of cleaning the toys in the bin that needs to be sanitized.\n3. Lots of toys missing parts or broken. The busy board that was on the wall a piece was about to fall off and it was missing a piece already.\nEdit: I mean, it took me all of 5 seconds to see the busy board needed repair.\n4. Place definitely needs to be reorganized and cleaned.\nEdit: While it could have been busy before we got there at 12:30pm, it certainly was not when we were there. I was there for my child and still managed to find a put toys back where they should have been and I don’t even work there.\n\nThe concept is good, but for the price I don’t think I’d return. Felt chaotic with how messy it was (And there were only 2 other kids in another room). The worker should’ve been cleaning things and organizing. Maybe they will next time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren McDade\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Wonderful place to play and drink coffee!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Horrigan\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for the kids, especially on a rainy day, but they really need to get the front desk some help! There's just way too much to do for one person, which means coffee/food service takes forever and the line is often long. The people working here are wonderful, but just completely overwhelmed.

I took two of my kids (ages 2 and 5) last week and they didn't want to leave. It was our first time at a play cafe like this, but the experience had us all wanting to go back more often!\nThe pros of this spot for me:\n- The seating area - I had a clear view from my table of basically all of the play spaces so when my 2 year old was wandering around, I could be at my table but still have eyes on her.\n- The selection of toys and activities. Between the play sets, the art center, and the discovery room - both of my kids were occupied for the 3+ hours we spent there, and we honestly could've spent many more.\n- The ability to come and go, and stay as long as we wanted. The biggest perk of Little Doodles to me is that our day pass covered the whole day! We got there 20 minutes after they opened, left to run to a store about 2 hours in, and then came back for another hour before we had to head to school pick up. That flexibility is huge for me as we drove an hour from the Lillington area to visit this location.\n\nWe ate lunch here and the food was okay. It is standard cafeteria-esque food you'd expect from a small cafe and fit our needs, but I wouldn't come here just for the food or coffee. It is the safe, fun atmosphere for the kids while the parent/caretaker can work or just hang out that you really come for - and they do that exceptionally well! We will return! I wish we lived closer because I would have bought the year membership on the spot and we'd be there several days a week! Living an hour away, I haven't decided how often we'll be able to make it up that way to commit to a membership just yet.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Galvanek\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I really want to love this place, but it just misses the mark each time we go. I just want a good coffee while I watch my kid play. Unless you drink black coffee, I would not recommend any coffee drink there. The staff is sweet, she’s just not a barista, and that’s fine. The toy sets that are there are cute and my kid likes them, but they don’t really have accessories for it (for example, the ice cream cart doesn’t have any ice cream in it. Sure, my kid can use her imagination, but at $10 per kid and an overpriced below average coffee, it’s just not worth it to us. Still, I give 4 stars because I do like the concept and the staff. It is just a bit overpriced for what it is.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucia Podrecca\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bryan D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had a great time celebrating our son's 2nd birthday here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tony Abba\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Cute place, kid loves it been for a few b day parties for 3 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Sabol\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank you!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aimee Niebauer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My daughter loves coming here and so do I.

We have never been here before but will be coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joylyn leach\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: My daughter and I loved this place. Very relaxing for me, mentally stimulating and fun for her.  They are very very clean. People tend to bring sick kids to indoor playgrounds but here they clean so often I felt safe letting my daughter play freely. They even have a baby area for parents to engage with their almost toddlers safely. Hands down our favorite indoor playground so far mainly because of how clean it is, the kindness and just the right amount of engagement from the owners.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abigail Geason\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: The absolute best playhouse we have been to so far!\nSo many age appropriate toys for kids of all ages and everything was so tidy and clean.\nThe owners truly make this place!

We love this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sydney Boatman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Had a great time today. Family run by a husband and wife, and you can tell they put their heart and soul into the business. For the amount of toddlers present, it was amazingly clean. I’m super hesitant about public restrooms, and I let my 2 year old use their restroom, which is really saying a lot from me.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaiti Courts\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: WKGP is always a favorite!!

They have lots of different activities for the kids to enjoy. A nice sitting area for parents to watch the kids. They also offer free coffee which is nice for those who need a lift. They do ask for you to wear grippy socks so the kids don’t slip on anything. They are also continuously cleaning during play time to help keep the space tidy and germ free. The staff were kind and welcoming. We will love to visit again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nakeysha B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We recently celebrated our son’s birthday here, and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish! The owners were genuinely excited to host us, and their enthusiasm made us feel truly welcomed. The entire space was clean, well-kept, and perfect for a kid’s party.\n\nWhat really made the day extra special was the surprise appearance from Spider-Man! He didn’t just show up—he played with the kids and made our son feel like a superhero himself. It was such a thoughtful and fun touch, and our son hasn’t stopped talking about it since.\n\nHighly recommend this place for any kid’s party. Great people, great environment, and memories that will last!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ty Longworth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We just stumbled on this hidden gem and absolutely love it!

I’m so excited that Mount Holly and the surrounding local areas finally have a play place for kids. I was always traveling into Charlotte to find activities. We were in desperate need of a place like We Kan Go Play. They have something for all ages 0-5. The ball pit and climbing wall was a total hit. There’s also a cute little coffee truck at the facility so you can sip while the kiddos play; such a perfect combination. The couple that runs the facility was so kind and generous. We will definitely be regulars here. 5+ stars for sure.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Dionne\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I would give 10 stars if Google allowed it! I cannot say enough about how magnificent our experience throwing our son's second birthday was at We Kan Go Play. Shay and Kyle went above and beyond in every single aspect and wouldn't let me lift a finger. They took care of everything from helping set up, to loading gifts into the car. My son's party was absolutely perfect. If you are looking for a place to throw a party for your little one please consider them. From the play area to Bluey coming out and dancing with the kids it was impeccable. Thank you Kyle and Shay!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mallory Tsiolkas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Our son had the most amazing 3rd birthday party here and we have nothing but great words to speak about the owners.

The very clear thought and care put into every aspect of this indoor play place is unmatched. There were many different types of play available for children including unique puzzles, a ball pit, slide, and lots of imaginary play areas.\n\nAs a mother of two children at very different stages of development I love knowing that they will both enjoy themselves here.\n\nWe will definitely be visiting  again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan O'Brien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 months ago\nReview: Couldn't recommend them enough! I've taken my two girls (4 and 9) for a regular play date and we loved it enough to immediately book a birthday party for the 4 year old.\nWhat you get with a place like this, as opposed to a chain, is that the owners clearly take pride in their work and are very hands on with everything. Everything is extremely clean and well taken care of, the toys are high quality, engaging and actually fun! The area is thoughtfully laid out to where you will constantly find new things as you walk around, but doesn't feel overwhelming with clutter.\nWith the party, I came in to decorate with a random box of decorations and Shay (one of the owners) came out to immediately help bring in stuff from my car and helped put up the decorations with me. Honestly, couldn't have done it without her. They make the whole process as easy as possible, they are there to help when needed and you don't have to worry any clean up!\nOverall, for parties or just a playdate for the kids, this place is a high quality establishment with extraordinary owners!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda O'Brien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We celebrated my kiddo’s birthday here, and We Kan Go Play made everything perfect!

Definately will be going back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Wolcott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We had our daughter’s 4th birthday here and everyone had the BEST time!! I got messages afterwards from parents of her classmates talking about how great it was. The owners couldn’t be nicer and are very organized. They checked in prior to the party with a schedule, had everything covered and thought through for the food, decor, music, and timing. They greeted our guests and helped with setup and take down which allowed me to just enjoy the party! The space was fun and incredibly clean. We will certainly be back and I would recommend this place to anyone for free play, events or parties!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tanya Barnes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place is awesome!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jerrika Swartz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Such a fantastic, safe play place!

The play areas are set up so we'll and even had some sensory areas that my little guy loved! The owners cleaned up and sterilized as the little ones played, making sure to keep them safe and allow some wonderful exploration for both the little ones and toddlers/preschoolers.

There is plenty of space for the littles to move around and play safely, but it is small enough that you can sit and watch them play and be able to see them easily. The owners were so friendly and the atmosphere has tons to do without being overstimulating. My 2.5 and 15 month old loved and we will 100% be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mini Evans\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Their level of commitment to service, cleanliness, and care are unmatched.

Don’t take my word for it, visit them yourself!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Diane Steil\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Such a wonderful place! The owners have created such a special and NEEDED spot for kids in the area.\n\nYou’re greeted as soon as you walk in with smiles, warmth, and *the most* aesthetically pleasing kids’ space I’ve been to around here. The colors, designated areas - everything was planned so intentionally.\n\nThere’s so much to do, and yet it’s done in a way that invites kids vs overwhelms them. Sensory areas, imaginative play, trains, a scarf wind tunnel, stem activities, indoor playground set, a gated baby play area, climbing and jumping… it’s all there, plus things like board games, color wonder and puzzles in the café seating area - which can also entertain older siblings.\n\nYou can make a cup of (complimentary) coffee, grab a seat, and see your child from any vantage point. Snacks are allowed to be brought in and also available for purchase - plus a water station.\n\nWhile you’re there, you’ll find “Ms. Shay” sanitizing often - checking in, engaging with the kids, and making it feel more like a community than just an indoor park.\n\nWe love visiting here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Q\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wow, what a great place! I could see the whole play area from where the sitting area is, and everything was set up perfectly so I felt totally safe just letting my kids run around without having me right by their side. The owners are AMAZING and we’re constantly cleaning and even playing with the kids! They even had free coffee and tea for the adults.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Margaritta Sepko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My granddaughter and her friend loves playing.

If you have a kiddo with sensory sensitivities or occupational therapy needs this playground will help meet several of those needs!

There’s so much for kids to enjoy, from sensory activities and imaginative play to ball pits and slides. The owners are absolutely wonderful, so friendly and welcoming. I also love the smaller size of the facility, which makes it easy to keep an eye on your little ones while relaxing in the comfortable seating area or even getting some work done.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart is its commitment to inclusivity. As a mom of a special needs child, I deeply appreciate the thoughtful design that makes it accessible and enjoyable for all abilities.

Large enough for child to explore with just the right amount of space to oversee their playtime and keep an eye on them. It’s clean and the ownership takes the time to speak to you and ask your thoughts. Innovative toys, sensory sections, and they also can do birthday parties. Section for parents to monitor is comfortable, and gate entrance once you walk in to ensure your child does not make their way out the door without you. Huge fan and will be adding this place to our list for rainy or really hot days.  Suggest you pre book your play time slot as they do monitor their capacity.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dianna Aboulhosn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We had such a great first experience at We Kan Play this morning. We loved that they were open early for our kids, 4 and 2 to play before their nap and they had a blast! The facility had so many different activities and stations set up for independent and creative play. There was a dress up station, salon, grocery store, ball pit, camp site, blocks etc. They have snacks for purchase and great seating for parents. We are so excited to have a play area like this so close to home and look forward to visiting again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A.

My 9 month old granddaughter is not interested in sitting at a table nor does she want to sit on a low couch.  she wants to crawl and have toys available (not the case here).  You did have one magnetic wall with twirl toys on she was interested in, but that was it.  There was another toy where you could put balls into it but there were no balls.  After being there possibly 10 minutes if that, we left.  Not going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latricia Barden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mikaela Clinton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My kiddos definitely had a good time and it is a good indoor play place for a wide age range. Not sure if it was just the day, but the cleanliness was something I was concerned about. I hope my kiddos don’t get sick from the visit but the floor and some soft play equipment was visibly dirty. Light socks may not have been such a good idea which surprised me given shoes aren’t allowed. I Would prefer them to put in some more sanitation protocols before we would visit again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Faiza Chaudhry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Took my toddler to over the moon for the first time and we had such a blast!

It was too frigid for a playground, but perfect for Over the Moon. Took the daughter here to release some of her energy.  This is a large space for infants, toddlers, and small children. A lot of stations with slides, jungle Jim’s, toys etc.\n\nBig kitchen in the back with snacks for purchase and free coffee for parents.  A good spot that is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oleksandra Biloborodko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Favorite fun place for kids in Cary ☺️🙌🏼 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley MacLachlan\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: It really saddens me to write this review, as once upon a time I would have easily written a 5 star review. I have been bringing my 4.5 year old daughter to Over The Moon since she was 1. Before she started preschool we used to come several times a week, we loved it that much! Unfortunately I think we have visited for the last time. The concept, decor, and toys at OTM are so cool and so much fun! Unfortunately, the decline in overall experience since we first started coming here has been SHARP in just about every way. When we first started coming there was a wonderful and caring group of staff members, and the same can not be said about the current group. The last several times we have come the staff have spent more time talking to each other than doing any kind of supervision of the play area. The last time we were there there was only one staff member working, and she NEVER looked back into the play area once. We used to see staff members occasionally go through and pick up toys, reset the obstacle course, etc. and we certainly have not seen that lately. While I’m always happy to see a local business succeed, the crowd level has been out of control lately, and it can be very overwhelming. Unfortunately, the bigger issue is that many parents don’t supervise their children adequately. Today a small child (who was in the calm toddler area, no less) whose parent was across the room threw a large toy rocket right at my daughter. Fortunately, it hit her in the back, not the head, but when the child’s parent was finally located they shrugged it off and continued to let the child run around unsupervised. The staff also didn’t seem to care about this incident or the lack of supervision which narrowly missed causing a serious injury. Unfortunately, that was the last straw for me. I truly hope the OTM experience can go back to the way it used to be, but until that happens, we sadly won’t be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: MH\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Fun play place for kids, plenty of seating for adults in the back too. The play space has some soft floor areas under climbing areas. Very clean, no shoes (wear or bring socks). The adult sitting area (if u choose to hang out there) gives you a great view of the whole place too. Also there’s workstations with plug ins too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristie Newsome\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I have taken my little ones here a few times, but have not experienced it from the party side. Recently, we had my daughter’s first birthday at Over the Moon and it was perfect. The communication was better than I could have asked for. The party hosts were absolutely amazing and made the whole process seamless for us. Parties can be stressful, so having people that know how to keep things on schedule was very helpful. The facility is always very clean and well kept and I appreciate that. Thank you to the Team for making our day special for us!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DaLena H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I met some friends here along with their kids.

They've really thought of everything. The play areas are clean and tidy, as well as super engaging for our kiddo. The free tea and coffee meant that the visit practically paid for itself as I was able to sit and get 1.5 of work done while my kiddo ran off her energy on a rain day. The climbing equipment was age appropriate and challenging enough that she was super proud of the skills she learned while she was there. She cried that she didn't want to leave and I had to reassure her we are coming back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Mills\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My grandson had a great time at Over the Moon.

This place is so thoughtfully designed for parents of young children- infant through elementary school aged.\n\nThe space is relatively large, very safe, and even has an infant area. The hours are broader than a lot of competitors and better priced. You can also buy memberships or multiple passes at a time at a discount.\n\nThe dining area is spacious while still allowing a great view of the play area. This space provides free specialty coffees (from a machine) and free WiFi!  They also have a fridge of snacks for purchase.\n\nThey offer free socks to borrow instead of only for purchase like most other places. You can use the space for free play or birthday parties. They have separate rooms for the food/cake during the party. We attended a birthday there and they did a great job hosting.\n\nThey also do an excellent job cleaning the facility throughout the day.  The staff is friendly and professional. I’m probably missing other great features I’ll think of later.\n\nI’ve been to all the indoor play areas around here and this blows all others out of the water!  I hope they consider opening more locations around the Triangle.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reggie Martin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My children had a great time and ran and played and really enjoyed the space. The free tune coffee was a nice touch for the adults and the good area for us to do work while the kids were entertained a bonus. Our children really enjoy the rock climbing wall and the scavenger hunt they held.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: L J\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Searched Google for 'indoor play'' and Over The Moon came up as one of the options. We checked in via a bar code or tablet. And paid the same way - $14 got us an hour and a half of play. Our 3 year old had a blast moving from obstacle to obstacle, climbing, and making friends. I would recommend adding a moon bounce or soft thick obstacles for small children to climb - our son needed help a couple of times, and a vending massage chair or something for parents. There was plenty of open space and room to play. Clean place and they offer a sink at the entrance for hand washing, cubbies for shoes, and coat hangers. No shoes or bare feet allowed in the play area, but they do offer socks for the little ones to borrow, if you forget theirs.  Very nice hosts who are friendly to the children and explain the rules. This location also offered free coffee, tables for snacks or sitting while you watch your little ones play (ok to bring your own snacks or kid water bottles), party rooms, etc. Not a lot of seats in the play area for parents but the floors against the walls are cushioned so you can sit and watch or do your own stretching ;). They also have a section for babies/toddlers and a fish tank in the corner.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veronika\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mallory Poole\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Over the Moon is a great option for an indoor play place in Cary!

Storage cubbies to put your things. Ask areas visible to easily always have an eye on your little one. Plenty of stations to keep the kids entertained. Not loud, crazy, chaotic when we went…assuming this is bc they limit amount of kids at play which was so nice! Will definitely visit again\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oliver Sherouse\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Phenomenal play space that caters to a variety of ages. It's a favorite for both of our kids. There's climbing structures, obstacle courses, building materials, toys, books, and an area just for smaller children, all with a space theme. The rocket with a view of outer space from the top level is a standout feature. Coffee and tea are free in the cafe area, and you can buy kid-friendly drinks and snacks. I recommend reserving ahead since they manage the numbers to keep it from getting too crowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maggie Sherouse\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Excellent spot for kids, never too crowded, and easy to have line of sight on multiple kids at once.

A large number of various equipment gives kids all kinds of activities to do diring their 80 minute time slot. I enjoy watching the owner periodically add new features to the space - like the Mission Control camera added next to their indoor rocket ship that displays kids up at the top. The massive KNex set that keeps growing is also really neat. The free latte machine is icing on the cake.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elisabetta Ballaben\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anne C.

My 6 year old has mild autism, specifically working on social/emotional skills a lot lately & self-regulation, and it was a fresh of breath air to go to a place where he was fully accepted whether he was calm or having an occasional moment. The boys' favorite activities were the rock climbing wall, ball pit and trampolines but there are lots of different sensory experiences and play options in the open spaces as well as little side rooms off of the main area. The owner and support staff were very friendly and helpful. They even offered snacks/drinks for my children from a kitchen on location.

The facility itself was clean, had a variety of activities (sensory swings, rock walls, cool down/quiet room, slides, etc…) they offered snacks/drinks for the kids and even coffee for the parents! From the time we walked in our kids were smiling and laughing for hours. It was a beautiful sight and it was a relief to be in a safe space. One where I don’t have to apologize if my children are too loud or have to explain what is already understood. I highly recommend bringing your family to experience this wonderful gym.

It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue \"Elsa\" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlyn Brown\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We had so much fun!

The play environment is always clean, well thought out, and inviting. The owners are so kind & plan fun events like story time/crafts and pizza play nights. I love how there are tables to sit and eat a snack or watch children play. Perfect place to meet up for a play date. 10/10 would recommend😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janelle James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My family had the best experience at this indoor play place. The owners were so friendly and down to earth. They are great people and very personable. The environment is targeted to younger kiddos. Our three and six year old kiddos had a blast. They played non stop the full two hour session. We were just stopping in the area for a short while during our travels but if we lived here then we would definitely get a membership here. Thank you so much little bee indoor playground! We had a fantastic time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: H T\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This playroom was perfect for my 2 year old! He spent the full 2 hours playing & having so much fun. The room is very clean & had many toys for all ages!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Ellwood\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son (newly 1 year old) had a BLAST at little bee! It was very sensory friendly and so many different areas/things to play with. The snack bar has a great selection and even a free coffee bar for the parents.\nThe lobby/lounge area is the perfect place for mom friends to meet up! You can tell much thought was put into this process... from the nursing room, to having high chairs for the littles. THANK YOU for bringing something like this to New Bern!🥰\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baily Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A}",

Staff lovely.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: T B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: This place was clean, and affordable! I think it was $13 for open play on a Monday.

We first went for a kid's birthday party and our own child had so much fun that we immediately knew we wanted to throw their party there when the time came. We just had our child's birthday today and it was great. The owner and staff were friendly, communicative, and kind. They really went above and beyond for our kid's party and helped ensure the it went off without a hitch! We had a great experience.\n\nThe place is so clean! It is big enough that all the kids can run around without it feeling crowded, but small enough that parents don't have to keep moving to keep their kids in line-of-sight.\n\nCannot say enough good things about this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Farah M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Loved this place! Went yesterday with my son who is almost 2 and it was perfectly age appropriate for him. The staff was SO nice.

I will return thank you.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dr. Michelle Laws\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This place is Amazing! A hidden gem in the kids play world.

RTP was in dire need of something like this, especially open until 6 on weeknights! They cap the number of children per two hour visit to 40, and for $16 (cash) my 2 year old was well entertained and always moving.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breeana Canada\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My child loved this place!

Super cute, family owned business. Great atmosphere! We had my son’s fifth birthday here, and everyone had an absolute blast. Fun bouncy houses, great area for little kids/infants, too! Parents can order coffee from the next-door shop without having to leave, such a great touch. Everyone who works here is so friendly, greeted by the owners daughter at the front with a big smile. Definitely coming back, definitely would recommend for kids having a birthday.}",

It’s so cool to see all the new stuff they’ve added but it’s a shame that the customer service has plummeted to a zero. I remember customer service used to be a top priority here. The teenagers working look like they’re being forced to work here and like it’s such a burden. One girl was asleep at the jumping zone where the air bag is. Smh there was multiple kids jumping at the same time, adults jumping with more than one child in their arms. There was no kind of safety being implemented. The other employees in the area would just point to her and laugh, they didn’t even bother to wake her up. 30 minutes of this went by before a manager was called over. Which leads me to my next point. The managers had no sense of customer service either. Would walk right  by you and make eye contact and not even smile or say hi. At one point a manger walked into the jump zone where the girl was sleeping and didn’t even say anything to her. When I worked here years ago, food that was ordered was brought to the customers wherever they were in the facility. I ordered food and after 20 minutes still had not received it, I went to the cafe and there my food was sitting under the warmer. I wish they would’ve told me I had to come get my food. I mean what’s the point of giving me a stand with a number if I’ve got to come get it myself? Maybe give me a time frame too! All in all my kids had a great time but as the adult who’s spending $40+ in just 2 hours, I lol at these things and they matter to me.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robin Henderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Lots of fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudio Coria\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren McDade\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Super fun for all ages!

Paid for a \"package\" with an \"add on extra attraction 1 time use\". The rides included in the package which had a countdown of 2 hours to use did not have operators at the attractions which meant even though they were advertised as part of the package, could not be used during periods of my 2 hour package. Several instances not due to my actions resulted in delayed operation times on rides which in turn ate into my kids 2 hour usage time. After all of the negative experiences went to use my add on attraction only to be told my time had ran out. Attendant called the supervisor over after I complained and he told them to let us use it anyway since we had paid for it, only to have an entire birthday  party pass us waiting for the manager to arrive which in turn would've meant waiting for 25 kids to get on the ropes course before my kid would have even though he was ahead of them in line. Would've took hour to hour and half just to ride one attraction.  Told manager we wanted a refund and he was an all out confrontational dick who refused to give me a 9.00 refund which in turn probably costed the establishment more than 9.00 in the long run. Hope someone in management learns a lesson from this.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris Custodio\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Park was great.

Lots to do to pass several hours of a day for younger kids. The games are reasonably priced but quick on game over. Bring about $100 for two kids just to get in the door though. Price is why 4 stars. It's a great bandaid between vacations but need to budget accordingly. The prizes for tickets are some of the best deals I've seen though.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: regina\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place to celebrate birthday.

We’ve been here many many times! It’s great for bad weather days because it’s all indoors. The prices are pretty reasonable, especially if you pay by activity. There’s bumper cars, a ropes course, go karts, laser tag, trampolines and many other attractions. Of course, there are a bunch of arcades! Overall, it’s a good time for kids. They also have food in the venue so that’s convenient. The crowd is also not very crazy on most Sundays, so it’s nice not to have to stand in line. Lots of convenient parking and lots of restaurants in the vicinity. It’s conveniently located, right off 540.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shea\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Poor customer service and communication at a high cost.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Steve Krantz\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Great experience for the children\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Debbie Masone\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Lots of fun things for kids and adults to do ‼️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: rhianna rovero\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: The Blue Morpho\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Super fun!

It's nice to be indoors but that limits the space available. They may have done better to have less attractions that each had more room. As it is, it felt cramped.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meredith Steimle\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Just visited this place and we will not be coming back. The Mission Control soft play space is absolutely filthy. I get it’s a high traffic area but you can see the dirt on the flooring, the soft touch toys are falling apart, and there’s trash everywhere. My husband even commented on how filthy it was. The mini golf was fun until a group of older kids come up and try to take my 2 year olds golf ball so they could play for free. Their parents did absolutely nothing, just sat and a corner, talked, and ignored the situation. Their kids were running all over the place and almost hit my son with a golf club. There are WAY better places for family fun.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diana May\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Paid for a 2 hr unlimited pass and waited over an hour for go carts. A complete waste of just under $200 for 4 kids. We will never be back and do not recommend this place. Many other fun places to take our kids for this amount of money. So disappointed\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JP The Reviewer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Amazing place, there's a trampoline park, go karts, bumper cars, Lazer tag, mini golf, and an arcade! There's also a cafe and the prizes you can get are reasonably priced! I forgot to say there's also a huge jungle gym for younger kids. And TONS of great games in the arcade! I highly recommend going here, and it's a great place for birthday parties.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathleen Werner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: “This place was really fun.

My kids didn't partake in the ropes, but I thought that was very cool and mini golf.  Bumper cars needs an expansion and update, plus the trampoline park needs a lot of tlc. The go karts are very hard to turn, so my husband and I had to drive our kids but it was nice being together.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tyler Hill\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Was actually disappointed. It's so busy that your 2 hour pass goes fast when waiting in line over half the time. Go carts are super slow and the guy operating them was super rude to my 10 year old son. Was an inch too short to drive though he races at rushhour. And had the nerve to tell him that \"maybe if you ate your Wheaties, you'd be taller.\" He was lucky the concrete around him didn't turn red.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christie Boyer\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Overall fun.

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.

The play space is perfect for kiddos (we had 33 kids plus adults in attendance with plenty of room) and they also offer vendors such as face painting. We were allowed to bring in our own food and an animal entertainer as well as decorate a separate area for photos. If you are looking for a birthday party venue, this is the place!

There is something for everyone and even with a large party the kids seemed to spread out to all of the different play areas. The zip line and trampoline were the favorites! Highly recommend We Rock The Spectrum for a birthday party! We will certainly be back for open play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria herrera\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: It is a wonderful place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Fun indoor area for younger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matt Cox\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I love We Rock the Spectrum gym in Morrisville, NC! It's a fantastic local business that provides a safe place for children to play. My kids love to spend hours here and it seems they never run out of different areas to explore. This gym is definitely not like other indoor play gyms, offering inclusive activities for all ages so It truly lives up to its motto of being for all kids. There is a separate play area for infants and younger toddlers, a teen room, and a quiet room to help if a child is overstimulated. The staff are ready and willing to help the children and are kind and happy to be there. We are definitely signing up for the summer camp\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Benjamin Busch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Good place for an hour or two with the kids stuck in Morrisville\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Hassler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I have nothing but wonderful things to say about We Rock the Spectrum in Cary.  My children (5 and 21 months) are always fully engaged with the many pretend play centers and gross motor activities. They especially love the trampoline, swings, and zipline! The owners Ryan and Eden are extremely kind and fully invested in this business that provides an inclusive space for all kids to play.

The owners and team are awesome to work with and offer such amazing support and peace of mind.  The birthday party experience was top-notch - so well organized, and the owner was in direct text contact with me throughout the planning so there was never a worry about any of the logistics.  Kids of ALL ages had the time of their lives!  The gym is so much fun for everyone regardless of ability; and you most certainly don’t “have” to be on the spectrum to play here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Timothy Hill\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Awesome place to take your kids, especially when the weather is bad and they are getting cabin fever.

We went as part of a pre school session so we essentially had the entire place to ourselves. The price is $18 per child with adults free. You take off your shoes and play in socks. They have so many fun and sensory seeking activities from a zip line, to rock climbing to trampolines to swings. There is a soothing calm room that is dimly lit. There is also an arts and crafts corner and little play stations for grocery shopping, a vet, trucks, dollhouses and many toys for imaginative play. Everything was clean and safe and well thought out. There is also a room to host birthday parties. We loved it and can’t wait to come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rich B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Reserved this place for my 2 year old’s birthday and it was awesome.

I brought my son here to play and for summer camp as we’ve had challenges with daycare/camp placements due to his exceptionabilities (if you know, you know). We Rock The Spectrum Cary has been a critical part of his healing journey; learning to trust and feel safe in a daycare/learning environments again, as well as restoring his confidence in himself and making new friends. So if you’re thinking about playing, caring, or camping here, don’t think about it, just Do It!

The equipment is really cool, of course, but the way we feel welcomed really warms my heart. It's so hard to just go about our day and not feel like everyone's looking at or judging us. Instead there's a building where everyone has been in your shoes. There was a meltdown situation last time I was there, and my son was set off from the noise.

We have been once for open play. We also utilized the Parents Night Out. My son runs in spurts, there wasn't much room for that.\nI do feel that they've made a good use of their space. He kept wanting to run on the mats where the zipline was, so I was getting looks. I still said sorry probably too much. My son seemed to really enjoy the parents night out. I was glad for that option. I would definitely utilize it again. We haven't been back for open play since adding a little one to our family. She's just now crawling. I don't see paying an extra $12 for an infant from birth to 1. I definitely can't bring her stroller in. There's not much space. I don't see paying $12 to carry around my baby to follow-up big brother around. He's not where I can feel comfortably and let him roam. I can't let her crawl around on the floor in there. Other than the slightly limited space and the high infant price (from 1 day old to 364) we really liked it. Customer service was average. They weren't rude, but weren't super friendly either.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fantastic gym & play area! 👍 Very impressed.\nClean, safe, and very well maintained equipment with a variety of play areas.

My four year old autistic son and six year old son with ADHD did their day camp for the last two weeks and have also been going to their weekend parties. They really liked it! This place has been truly a breath of fresh air - a place that is designed to accommodate my kids, releasing me from the usual worries that go with private drop-off programs like whether they will be patient and flexible with my kids and whether I'll get a call asking me to pick them up early because of \"bad behavior\" (which has usually been code for the camp having failed to provide adequate support). The place has amazing gym equipment to give my kids the proprioceptive and vestibular input (aka joy!!) they need. There's also an arts/crafts activity as part of each camp day. Critically, while the kids are given a schedule of activities (gym time, arts/crafts, lunch) and encouraged to follow it, there is plenty of flexibility if, for example, my kid really wants to just do gym equipment for the day. They can allow this because of the extremely high counselor-to-camper ratio.\n\nAn example of how this place made my life and my kids' life easier: one morning my boys decided at the last minute that they wanted to wear their superhero costumes to camp. I was able to give them a quick and easy \"sure, why not?\" And that was that. I wasn't worried that some adult or kid at the camp would hassle them or me over it.\n\nThey also have parties periodically. My kids have done those as well, and really liked them!\n\nThey also have various other things like birthday parties and parents night out (aka you can drop your kids there while you go on a date).\n\nI personally dropped the kids there every day and observed the vibe. It's a happy place. Music softly playing while kids swing, spin, jump and play.\n\nDid my kids need to be redirected sometimes (e.g. reminded of certain necessary rules like waiting for their turn for the zip line, or staying off the zipline runway for safety)? Yes! Did I feel this was always handled with kindness and understanding? Also yes! And that's the key. Jes, who runs it, is herself a parent of a neurodivergent kid, and I felt she really got it.\n\nThe camp is 9am to 1pm. The way that works is that 9am is the earliest you're allowed to arrive, and it's no problem if you show up late. It's not like there's some rigid group circle time activity at 9am that you'll get hassled for interrupting. When life happened, we sometimes showed up at 9:30 or 10 and it was fine. You need to come get your kids by 1pm, i.e. that's when they stop providing camp counselor staffing, but if your kid wants to continue there past 1pm you can pay for Open Play for the afternoon while you hang out there.\n\nFor those who, like us, live far enough away that it's not realistic to do two round trips for drop off and pickup, there are a couple options that worked well. One option, which we ended up doing almost every day, is that we had a sitter pick the kids up at 1pm and take them to a playground or play space for the afternoon (e.g., Downtown Cary Park, Pleasant Park in Apex, Over the Moon, Marbles Museum). I understand that's not an option for everyone. Another option is that sometimes I'd stay in the Cary/Morrisville area for the morning, filling the time on my laptop at a cafe or walking one of the nearby trails. There's also a lot of shopping nearby (e.g. Trader Joe's, Target, Michaels, Home Goods).\n\nI'm posting this because I think this place is really valuable and serves a huge need in the Triangle area for neurodivergent kids, so I want others to be aware of this resource. I also want it to succeed so that it will continue to be there for my own kids! The business just opened and I can tell they are still evaluating whether they can make it work. The more people who go, the better their chances will be! I'm hopeful that they will eventually also open a location over here where we live in Chapel Hill.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Canito Rodriguez\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Children's game room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: FP\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love Kids Gym.

Though he thoroughly enjoys trying out new playgrounds and play places, we've had several occasions where he gets over excited or over simulated and gets loud or a little too wild, thus causing other kids to get upset or other parents to stare and pass judgment. Judgment. I love how at this play place, children are free to play in a non-judgmental space. I also appreciate the fact that a lot of the play activities are based around different movements and fun that support an array of sensory needs. Both of my children, ages 15 months and 4 1/2, loved coming here! Will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veronica\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very nice place!

It was definitely the BEST venue we have ever chosen! We were able to rent the entire space, so it was just our family and friends, which was so nice. It kept the noise (and germ) levels down and everyone had an AMAZING experience! The kids had an absolute BLAST and the parents did too! When I arrived, Jessica (one of the founders) and her team of employees immediately jumped in to help me decorate the party room!!! They untangled balloons (it was windy), put together my cupcake stand, hung our backdrop & other decorations, put tablecloths on the tables, and helped me figure out which tables would work best for gifts, desserts, food, and seating. They put little monster trucks on cupcakes and the cupcakes on the stand. They even took photos of the party room for me once it was decorated. They help supervise the kids and keep them safe (especially on the zip line, rock wall, and giant trampoline), which allows parents to relax a bit instead of having to be on high alert nonstop.\n\nThe entire facility was SPOTLESS (it always is). When I walked in, there was employees all over the place spraying and wiping down counters, equipment, toys, etc. I am an RN. So, I tend to be hyper aware of germs and the importance of proper cleaning between parties is huge for me.\n\nJessica was absolutely WONDERFUL! She asked what kind of music we preferred and what volume level. She (and the rest of her staff) were super friendly and show genuine concern for kids with sensory issues and they also understand that all kids can get overwhelmed due to sensory overload! That is why they have a calming room with sensory friendly lighting, noise canceling head phones, quiet activities, and comfy pillows to sit and relax on. It is so nice for kids (and parents) who need to take breaks from the noise! I cannot say enough good things about We Rock the Spectrum! I take my son and my niece frequently to play and have introduced lots of our friends too. I highly recommend them anytimew, and for birthday parties (both the experience and the value for such an affordable price) they reign supreme!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Theresa H.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just had my 1yo party there,  and i couldn't be happier.

We're thrilled to hear you had a great experience at We Rock the Spectrum. It means the world to us to provide a space where kids can play and enjoy themselves. We can’t wait to welcome you back for more fun!\n\nP.S. We just figured out how to respond to reviews—better late than never, right?\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lana Purvis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amazing Amazing Amazing !!!! I’ve never seen such an incredible place for children\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maha Tariq\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son attended the summer camp and had such a great time! We've also gone back for open play and it's always so fun. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Phenomenal experience, extremely accessible playspace\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Summer Leverette\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We LOVE IT HERE! While the space is small compared to other places, there's lots to get into. My toddler is shy and likes to play alone and there are many corners for her to do just that until she has had time to open up.\nThey even have a calming room, craft area, and a teen room for those who are required to be there but want to get away.  The staff makes it easy to checkin and monitor the floor and tidy up around the kids. The families that come in are polite and friendly, not too invase. A perfect place for a rainy weekend or a day that too hot or cold to play outdoors.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madison Barnes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very quickly became a my kids favorite place. Just an all around great environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I LOVE that such a place exists! My son absolutely loves it and it’s nice having a place to take him when I’m feeling overwhelmed. It also has given me a lot of ideas for toys for him. It’s hard to find what he likes because of his autism. It’s also great for connecting with other autism parents, I wish I could give it more than five stars!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brian Pearl\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Was VERY disappointed to find out that their track out camp is only for kids up to 10yrs old. It’s not mentioned on their website. I called before visiting and wasn’t told. When I visited with my son it wasn’t mentioned. When I called after visiting and talked to one of the owners I still wasn’t told. Taking kids with Autism out in public is VERY stressful for parents. And we live 30 minutes away. I would not have spent the time, money, and anxiety to go had I known.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diane Rizzi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place! Perfect location also! As a nanny I set up play dates with other Nannie’s and moms for the kids and this is perfectly located in between Cary, apex, and Durham. It also has things for the older siblings on their days out of school. The owner and staff are also very friendly. A great place to hangout with the littles.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mikey B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4yr old Absolutely Loves This Place. Would give it 10 Stars if I Could. They have a One Of A Kind Facility Offering a Safe & Fun environment for My Son, who has a speech delay to learn, laugh, & play with other kids.\n\nThank You We Rock The Spectrum!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thais Costa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It’s an awesome place, super clean, safe and the staff is super attentive\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A Non\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super cool spot.

My three were playing and using their imagination nonstop for 2.5 hours which is all that I could ask for on a rainy day like today. Although the building was pretty packed full of kids, it didn’t seem like it was due to the large spaces in each designated area and no shortage of toys at all! Will definitely be coming back when we want to spend some money at a play place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adeeba Jamal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 days ago\nReview: Celebrated our daughter’s 4th birthday party here.

I visited for the first time with my 2 boys and their preschool class and they were entertained for 2 full hours non stop.. they asked when we can come back! Thank you for creating such a cool space for kiddos to play in an open room that is easy to have eyes on them the entire time. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: lindsey michels\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Im writing this on behalf of my friend. We came in today hoping to have a play date but unfortunately my friend had left because of the rude behavior Valeria responded with. All my friend asked was if she could turn the music down and she said she would a little but then turn it back up when the other kids  arrive. I know it sounds so small but my friend is around a lot of loud noises all the time and she was just asking for a small favor it was rudely considered. It was obvious Valeria just didn’t want to deal with her and brushed her off and was short. It’s unexpected to see this behavior at pricey establishment I would expect more respect.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erica Carambot\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We had our son’s 3rd birthday party at Town of Fun, and it was absolutely perfect!

From setup to cleanup, she was incredibly helpful, thoughtful, and accommodating.\nAll the parents were impressed, and most importantly, our little guy had the best time ever.

The space was perfect—big enough for our group of close to 20 kids to run around and play without ever feeling crowded, even with around 45 people (kids and parents) in total.\n\nThe play area was clean, safe, and packed with fun things to do. The kids had a blast, and the setup allowed parents to relax while still keeping an eye on everything.\n\nThe staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, making sure the event ran smoothly from start to finish. It was such a stress-free celebration, and several guests commented on how great the venue was.\n\nHighly recommend Town Of Fun for anyone planning a fun, well-organized birthday party or event for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellen Cassidy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had such a great time at Town of Fun! Everyone absolutely loved it— there’s a wide variety of activities to discover, play with, and learn from. The soft play area for toddlers (under 3) is fantastic, with a contained space featuring foam climbing structures and a fun ball pit.\n\nOne of the highlights was the beautifully crafted, realistic playhouse. It’s thoughtfully designed, spacious enough to fit an adult or two, and really captured the kids’ imaginations—it was a big hit!\n\nThe entire space is clean, beautifully designed, and clearly well thought out. The owner and staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and clearly dedicated to providing a wonderful experience for families. I’d highly recommend it for a fun day out with little ones or as a great venue for a party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abigail Klisures\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had our daughters birthday party here this past weekend and I can't believe how easy it was from start to finish! I was frustrated with the balloon arch we brought and the team completely took over for me and hung up it up. I really appreciated how they kept the party on track by announcing it was time to eat and serving everyone. The play space was perfectly clean and they did an incredible job packing up all our things and cleaning up for us when it was over. Even the older kids at the party had a blast and did not want to leave. I would highly recommend this space for a fun play day or a party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Jackson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Such a fun place! It's clean, there's a wide variety of toys and things to do, and it's easy to see your kiddo from across the room if needed to step away from their side for a second. There is nice soft seating for parents and tables/chairs/benches all around the room. My 3 year old loved it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth Godwin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: This is such a wonderful place to play!

There are so many activities to explore, play with, and learn from. My little one, who is 2 years old, really enjoyed the ball pit and could have spent hours there!\n\nThe space is beautiful, clean, and thoughtfully designed. We also attended a birthday party during our visit, and the setup was fantastic — open, bright, and seamlessly connected to the play area. I really appreciated that the party space wasn’t tucked away in a separate room; it allowed the kids to enjoy both the party and the play zones freely.\n\nThe owners are incredibly nice, welcoming, and clearly passionate about creating a great experience for families. I highly recommend it for a day out with young kids or for hosting a special event. ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nada E\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My 4 year old daughter was obsessed with this place!

The public parks in my area of Cary provide limited play areas for small children.  The Town Of Fun does.  My 3 year old granddaughter had a blast during the  2 hour session.  She interacted with other children which will aid your development.  Sorry I did not find this place earlier.  Great atmosphere and personnel. Highly recommend it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hope Newland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: LOVE THIS indoor play place!*!*!*!*!* Very clean, tons of diverse activities to get into and role play with your kiddos.

She sighed as she walked up, very put out to help us. Rudely asked if we had a reservation and when we said we didn’t she said she already had 30 kids and couldn’t take any more which is fine but how she treated us, wasn’t. If a reservation is needed, it should be clarified online as my daughter left disappointed she couldn’t play. We will not be back as to how we were treated.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamechia Burton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We recently celebrated my daughter’s birthday here, and it was absolutely perfect!

It was extremely clean and the lady at the desk was so friendly. I’ve been to a similar place in Fuquay-Varina but it is 50 minutes away and Town of Fun is so much cleaner and roomier. My granddaughter had a lot of fun and I love how the children use their imagination. We will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rhianon Purro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I didn’t grow up with birthday parties so that was something I wanted to change when I had kids. After visiting Town of Fun the first couple weeks they were open, I was so impressed that I immediately went home and booked online.\n\nTo say it was the easiest and best experience is truly an understatement. I filled out the form and booked my date online (I hate when I can’t book online) and received an email confirming/ asking if I had any questions before I even had my coffee the next morning.\nAll emails that I received there after were just so organized and streamlined.\n\nThe day of the party I was so nervous, especially with a possible snow storm, but when I showed up that afternoon, everything was set up for me which truly allowed me to enjoy the time with my child and all her friends without having to worry about anything. The organization of time, clean up, and everything was truly the best. And even better, my child (who just learned to FaceTime) has been begging me to FaceTime all our family members so she can tell them how awesome her party was.\n\nIf I could give ten stars I would!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Josh and Sandy Hankins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 2 year old loves playing here and we’ve had great experience with their staff. I recently prepaid but then needed a refund due to illness and Isaac was so quick to respond to my email request. The staff is professional and so easy to work with.\n\nThe space is clean, organized, and there’s so many fun things for the kids to do. We love inviting friends here for play dates!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dr. Warren D. Spinner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Excellent place. Kept my 5 year olds well entertained. Warm and friendly staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Barr\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Really cute for up to age 5. The “under three” section should really say for “18 months and under.” It’s clean and bright and airy. Only reason it doesn’t get five stars is it was freezing— even the kids were cold, and the music is super annoying and blaring over the adult sitting area— not even the kid’s area. Wish it was more muted or even kid friendly classical.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ronnie Jardine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My boys loved playtime here....definitely will be back in the near future...highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam Alinaghi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We loved our first visit at town of fun. I have a 2 year old and 5 year old and both of them were entertained the whole time! It is an extremely clean place. Love that they have specific time slots and clean in between. They also had a fun art area that was a nice break from playing. The manager was super friendly and was very present the whole time, answering questions and offering to help!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Rivers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Fun, kid friendly, clean and great for getting energy out! Our 2.5 year old had a blast and enjoyed playing with other kids around her age. Especially love the soft climbing structures for under 3s!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cassandra Allen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I have visited the play space twice now, and truly I am so impressed and love the atmosphere! The CLEANEST indoor play space hands down, and the details are impeccable. The space is so spread out and you never feel on top of each other. The cap on the play time is incredible, and having the space to bring your own food, change your kiddos, make art projects, and play, the owner has thought of everything. She is the most kind person, and you can tell she really cares about her customers! We got blocked in by a huge truck unloading to another business and she let us stay inside and wait for the truck to move so we didn't have to sit in the rain. And the other time my son fell down and she gave him stickers and checked on him to make sure he was okay! We will be back PLENTY! LOVE it!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We had the greatest experience with our 1 year old birthday party at Town of Fun! Valeria was super responsive when I booked and anytime I had questions in between the time I booked and the week of the party. The space was so easy to decorate and the team at Town of Fun pitched in wonderfully for our set-up and breakdown. The party is 2 hours and we had such a great time, I wished we had just a bit more time to eat food/socialize. But I felt like the food/cake time was a little short because 1. One year olds are new eaters and needed a lot of supervision during meals and 2. My family/friends love to talk/socialize while eating. For future parties for my family, I know now to shorten the playtime to allow for more time to eat/socialize with guests🙂.\n\nThe facility is new, clean and is in a prime location (Morrisville/RTP. There’s plenty of parking too! Thank you for hosting our baby’s first birthday party, we will be back again soon to play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kelsey tunstall\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: An awesome place for small children… you can enjoy watching them play without it being overwhelming\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gal Gad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Lopez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My friends and I brought our 3 toddler boys here this morning for the first time and may have loved it as much as they did!\n\nSuch a cute spot, with so much to do without being overwhelming.

The only wish I have is the little toddlers space had a separate taller gate that adults had to open or something to make sure the bigger kids stayed out (which I’m well aware is very difficult!!). Some of the older kids were still coming in and for some of the little kids it got a little scary. But I loved everything about it we’ll hopefully do a membership and classes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica wangqin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: I compared 5 or 6 indoor play centers in the North Carolina area and finally chose TOWN OF FUN. I’m really happy I selected this place for my 4-year-old son’s birthday party.\n\nThe environment here is great and very clean. Since it’s a newly opened play center, all the toys are brand new. The indoor space is large, and even with nearly 40 guests, the room didn’t feel crowded at all. Both adults and children had separate areas to relax and play.\nThe staff was incredibly responsible and attentive. I’m especially grateful to Valeria, who coordinated with me via email during the planning phase. I shared my preferences regarding the party’s timing and decorations, and she arranged everything perfectly. She even reminded me of details I hadn’t thought of, like background music and setup times, and helped me plan accordingly. On the morning of the party, 4 or 5 staff members helped us set up the room quickly. They worked fast and had all the necessary equipment, so we finished decorating in less than an hour, leaving me plenty of time to prepare for other things.\nDuring the entire birthday party, the staff cooperated with all our plans. They helped organize games for the kids, served food, greeted guests, and sorted the presents. We invited 17 families, so there was a lot to handle, but with their assistance, everything went smoothly. I am so thankful for that.\nI also noticed how seriously Town of Fun takes hygiene. After the guests left, I saw the staff immediately begin cleaning the room and toys, even skipping lunch. They thoroughly cleaned the ball pit with a vacuum and paid great attention to detail. I believe this is especially beneficial for young children, as their immune systems aren’t fully developed, making them more susceptible to germs in indoor play areas. Their focus on cleanliness helps protect the kids.\nIt’s very fun! Children aged 1 to 10 can all have a great time here – it’s definitely a paradise for kids.\nI’m so glad my son had an unforgettable birthday party here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruth Aka\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Oh my, what a wonderful place! We drove 30\nMins just for this place and it did not disappoint. So glad I found this place, my daughter enjoyed playing here and the two hours went by fast for her. The place is new and is very clean and organized. We will be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Naveen Chapa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We hosted our birthday party at town of fun and it was a blast. Kids had very good time. This place has lot of pretend and play scenes and will engage kids (2 to 6) the most. They also have secured section for below 2 years to crawl and play. The party space was huge and we could bring our own food. Team was very helpful in setting up our party decor and accommodated our customizations. A microwave oven would have helped but we understood they don’t have full kitchen.\n\nThe large open space makes this venue a must choose for any occasion. You could book the space for as much as time as needed for additional charge. Kids will enjoy the most.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stefanie Menardy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My kids had a great time here! It's like a mini Marbles Museum. There is plenty to explore and the 2 hours goes by quickly. I would definitely do the membership if we lived closer or if they had later hours during the week. I highly recommend checking it out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aishwarya Subramanian\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Thank you so much for your review!

Well organized with lots of play spaces and things to do. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savannah Dillard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We loved this new play space! Everything is very well planned and i so appreciate the parent seating space and organized diaper changing station in the  bathroom. I would love if sanitizing hands was required before playing (lots of play places require this) and if more sanitizer stations were readily available near the kids play space! That’s my only worry with a place like this is the spreading of germs!\n\nIn addition, the price made me sad! I was so hoping this would be a place that we could frequent but $20 for my one child for 2 hours will make it a treat for us but sadly not a thing we can routinely do!! I loved everything this place has to offer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Somu Arun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Took my kids here today and they had a blast! Would be great for birthday parties, highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamie Pollard\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: A really cute and clean place. All of the play areas are really well put together and there is a ton of space for kids to run around. It was very entertaining for my busy two year old.\n\nThe only downside is how expensive it is. It is almost 20.00 for two hours of play. I wasn’t aware they didn’t do drop ins and that the two hour play sessions started at a certain time so I paid for 2 hours of play but only received 1 hour for my son.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Veerappan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Loved this new establishment!!!

Well organized into different spaces, lots of variety, and seems well thought out. My only ask is to add a hand sanitizer station up front and require use to help minimize germs like most other spaces do.\n\nPS- don’t forget socks for everyone. They’re $3 if you forget your own.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shannon B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: My kids has a blast! Especially loved the ball pit!

Beautiful space for parents to sit. Owner was sweet and friendly. A safe soft space with a ball pit for the younger ones and arts and crafts for the 6 year old. You kids can pretend to be a firefighter, doctor, veterinarian, astronaut, artist, mechanic, diner owner or a ball!}",

I enjoyed this and I think my 7 year old would enjoy this place. They need more toys for the young toddlers. My toddler became easily bored within the first 10 minutes of our first visit here. Which is unfortunate since Piney is only 9 minutes from our home. Also adding that’s its $15 and some change for an hour I was expecting a lot more. I think adding more toddler friendly activities/toys could easily fix my review.\n\nAside from this it’s very clean and was a good first experience for me.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Rinderer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: What a wonderful place for children to play and use their imagination.

Every detail was thoughtful, colorful, and perfect for the occasion. The kids had a blast, and the entire event was so well-organized that we could actually relax and enjoy it.\n\nWe initially had some concerns because we invited a big group of friends, and we were worried the space might be too small or that we’d somehow be over capacity — but the space was HUGE! It was more than enough for everyone to play, mingle, and celebrate comfortably. Courtney, the owner, even called me personally before the party to check in, reassure me, and make sure we were confident in moving forward — that level of personal care really meant a lot.\n\nWe chose the Pandarosa package, which included 48 cupcakes, sweet tea, lemonade, chicken trays for the adults (so delicious!), and 7 large pizzas for the kids. There was plenty of food and even some left over — they really thought of everything.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Ede, Railey, and Madison who were absolutely wonderful — so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the entire party. Their energy made the day even more special.\n\nOverall, Piney Town made Zayn’s 3rd birthday unforgettable. Everything was smooth, stress-free, and full of joy. We can’t thank Courtney and her team enough, and we highly recommend Piney Town Play Space to anyone looking for the perfect place to celebrate!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Isaac Miller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Paula Allison\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Fun place for little kids.

They have added to the space and the place always looks and feels clean. It is definitely a great place for the younger kids my 7 year old gets board quickly ( unless he finds a playmate) 3 to 5 year old seem to have the best time. The place is small which is great is only one person is taking 2 kids or if you are meeting up for a play date and the parents can actually talk as your kids are never too far away. Also they sell coffee and snacks if needed! Great local place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerri Starnes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 6 months ago\nReview: We love Piney Play House!

I love them! They definitely deserve a raise! They took care of myself and my family. I wish more places had attendants like these two young ladies. It was a lovely feeling to be tended to in the way they did while I had hosted the party.\n\nDefinitely book your party here or at least enjoy the open play! 10/10 recommend!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly Bird\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: The best place I have hosted a birthday party.

My daughter really enjoys her time there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Josey Perry\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Beautiful place! Our daughter loved the play area. I do wish I had been warned about most of little girls wearing princess dresses. Being our first time I didn't think that was a thing. My daughter felt left out. We saw Belle and she was very snarky towards kids and played favorites with some of the girls. She was very overwhelmed! Would go again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 9 months ago\nReview: I love Piney Town but more importantly, my granddaughter does.   She always enjoys the open play but had her first character experience on Sunday and was ecstatic.  I could not have asked for a more positive experience.   The tickets are limited to the amount sold so it's a small intimate group.  \"Moana\" took time to make sure every child felt special.   They had a group activity, pictures and just a super time.  Thank you Pineytown you are knocking it out of the park.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J P\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: The place seems very clean and the different themed centers are absolutely adorable.  The reason that I’m only giving 4 stars is that there seemed to be a lack of actual toys in each of the centers.  There were probably 20 children there during our visit.  There were only 2 ride on toys, the toys in the themed centers seemed very sparse, and the train table (which was very popular with the little boys) only had 3 magnetic trains.  I’m sure that the reason is to make clean-up more manageable, but helping children learn to share is near impossible with not enough toys to go around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelsey Durham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: This place is so cute!

Cones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Fabulous experience! We attended the sensory friendly event and it was exactly what we have been looking for locally! My children love playing at Piney Town, and at busier times it can get overwhelming for my kids (but great to see a local, family owned business thriving and full of joy!). I highly recommend checking out the sensory friendly playtime for anyone with children who need a calmer environment to explore and play. I am happy to support a business where the owners listen to feedback, ask questions, and work to make their environment enjoyable for all children.\n\nMy family has also attended the daddy/daughter event and a princess event, as well as regular open play sessions and have had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla Gregory\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We always appreciate how clean, organized, and fun this indoor play place is!

Always recommend this to any families with littles.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: We have a membership and go all the time. The staff are so nice and always cleaning/resetting the play areas. The owners are nice too. My son loves going here. It's a great place.

Kids ranged in age from 2 to about 6. The parents were about 80/20% Helicopters/Free Rangers. Don't judge this book by it's cover...there's a great downtown themed setup inside for creative children's play. Coffee snack bar for the Free Rangers, lolz. Group sizes are limited, advanced tickets recommended.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Hochler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: great fun for my 18month girl\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Mellin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you, Brittany!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Candace Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was one of the best indoor playgrounds I've ever seen 👏 Very clean, friendly staff, two bathrooms and high quality toys and playrooms. Wonderful for cute pics of your kid as an added bonus 😆\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dariene Watkins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Piney Town is awesome!  It is a clean, safe place for indoor play.  It is particularly nice for littles to get energy out without constantly having to say, \"No, don't mess with that,\" as we would at home.  There is a separate space for 2 and under to enjoy age-appropriate toys.  The bigger-kid space offers costumes for dress up fun, a stage for performances, a farm, an auto shop, a grocery store, a police station, a house, a construction site, a treehouse, and an ice cream stand.  There is something for everyone!  We have not yet been to any events, as our little is too little to enjoy them and we do not want to take space from people who are able to do so; but they sound like a good time for kids who actually know the characters.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fantastic location for a birthday party. We had my daughter’s 5th *Barbie* party there today and I was very impressed by the facility and the staff. We will definitely party with them again!

Wow!  It's amazing how much more inviting the space is with just a few changes.\n\nThe addition of the treehouse and seating areas made a world of difference.  My 1 year old and 5 year old both had a blast (which is rare with the age difference).  We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Curtis Reinking\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I took my 4 year old daughter on my day off, the staff were available to immediately check us in (we had prepurchased our time), and the staff was on a constant rotation of resetting the toys after the kids had played with them. Everything was clean and in good shape. There was plenty of room for the number of children and my daughter loved all the activities available.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Hightower\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is such a fun indoor play spot for young kids! My toddlers enjoy playing with all of the toys, dressing up, and the big tunnel slide to show how “brave” they are!

We recently went to one of the events that they hosted (the Barbie party) and it was so great!\nThey had Barbie come out and read a book, then had a scavenger hunt, and did a bracelet making activity, then they had a dance party. My daughter's bracelet broke during the dancing and Barbie sat down with her to help her remake her bracelet. It was really special.\nWe had a great time and will absolutely be making this a regular spot in the rotation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olivia Clapp\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We hosted our daughter’s birthday party there and it was amazing.

Piney Town is always clean, has tons to keep kids occupied and their special events are always so much fun! I just went to the Baby Egg Extravaganza and the live bunnies and chicks made my daughter so happy! They also keep the groups small so if your toddler is just walking they won’t be knocked over by kids that are too old for this activity. I will continue to visit Piney Town and look forward to the next special event!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linda Healy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our little 2 year-old grandson absolutely loved playing at Piney Town at the 8:30-10:30 session on Saturday morning.

They offered me a free 1 time pass to this place and therefore I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Its still dusty, the surfaces are sticky, hairs are stuck to lots of the toys, but it's the staff's fault, not the owners. So, here I am, updating my review back to 5 stars. I just don't want to harm this nice family business. It's a great place for little kids to play, amazing idea and a great addition to the area. The staff is extremely friendly, but can't clean well for some reason.\n\nUPD: We used to go there, but not anymore. The place is dirty, dusty and most of the surfaces are sticky and disgusting. The staff members are very friendly, but constantly staring at their phones and don't clean during the day.\n\nThe cutest place for toddlers ever! I wish they had longer hours. The staff is friendly. Fascinating decorations!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adriea Laurore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Went for a character event and had a blast.

I was also happy that it was not overly packed with people and kids, especially on a weekend. Definitely will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Gillespie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: EDITED 2/9/24: I said I would never come back here but I have eaten my words and have changed my review from 1-star to 5-stars. The new owners are amazing and have really turned this place around. They have restructured the play area, now offer snacks and coffee, and provide more supervision during play time. They even offer events each month and have extended their hours to include afternoon play times! Piney Town has gone from being the worst indoor play place around to the best, by far.\n\nI never thought I would be writing this review or have a membership (because we are there at least once per week), but here we are.\n_______________________________________________________________\nTHIS REVIEW WAS FOR THE PLAYHOUSE MUSEUM...BEFORE THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP.\nMy issue is not really with the Playhouse itself but more the culture there. We have been 3 times and the facility itself is great and the staff are always super friendly but, some parents don’t watch their kids AT ALL.\n\nEvery time we have been there has been an issue with at least one kid pushing or shoving or taking toys from other kids (just being kids), but there is no redirection or even acknowledgement from the parent.\n\nUntil today, I just chalked it up to differences in parenting and it wasn’t a deal-breaker for me. As a stay-at-home mom, I totally understand needing a break and wanting to let your kids figure things out socially for themselves. However, today, my child was playing on the fire truck and sitting in the driver seat, when a child literally picked him up out of the seat and threw him out of the truck. I removed the child from the and out my very upset toddler back into the driver seat. I told the kid that he could play there when my kid was done.\n\nThe mother didn’t come over until much later and didn’t even ask me what happened. Instead she asked me “did you just put your hands on my child?” and didn’t even apologize when I told her what happened.\n\nAgain, I know this is not really the fault of The Playhouse Museum, but all the same, I don’t think this place is for us and we will not be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adam Scher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I brought my daughter for the Daddy/Daughter event and it was absolutely amazing. We both had so much fun and the staff was very warm and friendly.

We started coming when they had just opened and have been coming ever since. During the second year of the pandemic they were one of the few play places that were open and were instrumental in providing a since of normalcy for the parents and kids. We also had my daughters 3rd bday here and it was a blast. We rented the whole place out and it easily accommodated all of our guests.To this day whenever I am feeling cooped up in the house I go to Bumble Brews and am able to enjoy a great time with my kids as well as some much needed adult interaction. I've had so many great conversations with other moms here and met a friend who I've now been friends with for almost 3 years. I am so grateful for Bumble Brews and the role it has played in my life as a first time mom and now mom of 2. The owner is also very kind and professional too and a big reason we've continued going all these years. We've been going to Bumble Brews for about 3 going on 4 years now and needless to say it's been a special part of our lives. I'm so thankful to Blair and her husband for providing such a great place for parents and kids in our community.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thando M.S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: very cosy and child friendly. kids love it big and small (7months - 5/6 year olds) . you’re kids have fun playing with all there is while you can have some coffee (anything they offer) and it’s really a great place to have your kids and yourself to experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alisha Neblett Thompson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Very clean, and a great place for kids to play or host a birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tatiana Olaru\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: This place is a total gem for little ones! There’s so much room for open play, which is perfect for burning off all that toddler energy. They’ve even got a little section for crawlers and tummy-time babies, so every age is covered.

We’re hooked!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Trimble\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: I see a lot of reviews on here that just don't coordinate with where I was today.  The toys aren't dirty or broken, the staff is very friendly, the play area is full of alot of great things.  One of the issues people have is their kids don't have imagination.  One issue is, maybe check when the place closes instead of just driving 30 minutes just to find out when they close.\n\nMy experience with Bumble Brews was a great place where my kids had an amazing time, dad(me) had a very nice cup of coffee, and the owner, if he isn't he's still awesome, had a good chance to shoot the breeze.  We are from Wilkesboro, but if we stay in Cary again, would definitely come back again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael Lewis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Bumble Brews was perfect for our son's 3rd birthday party. We had ~14 children and ~20 adults and there was room for more. The kids had a wonderful time, as expected, but the adults also really enjoyed watching their kids play without having to worry about them getting hurt or running too far away. The coffee and snacks there were fantastic. The staff was super helpful and flexible with our party and our group the entire time and made it so much easier than previous parties we have hosted at other sites. All of the feedback from party guests was extremely positive and many and planning to use this location for their next party. Highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelina Ignatova\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miranda Swinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We held my daughter’s 3rd birthday party here and had a wonderful experience with everyone.

We came as a group of children and moms. My friend's child was crying loudly and playing around. Eventually, a stranger's boy started bothering my friend's son, and the mother defended her child. The owner then came over and asked us all to leave because the mother of the boy who was fighting claimed that our children were aggressive. I wasn't refunded for leaving earlier (my son was calmly playing with books). The cameras in the establishment were not working, and no one bothered to resolve the situation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Cantey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and accessible for kids of various ages, but most appropriate for toddlers to pre-kindergarten.

My husband and toddler had enjoyed the location previously, but they were also able to come to our rescue as a birthday party location on short notice. Incredible experience from start to finish - kind and quality service all the way. The idea itself is just wonderful. Kids get the opportunity to play and explore the cute and clean play area while parents can get a break within view and easy reach at the attached cafe - which serves a variety of snacks and beverages. The birthday package is such a great deal - you get the dedicated space for up to 50 people. And the staff (including the lovely owner!) were so great - especially patient with the few rowdy older siblings we had attending the 4 year old focused event. Highly recommend Bumble Brews for events, playdates, or just to get out of the house! Excellent idea, beautifully executed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dafina Dervishi\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It was nice but open play was over crowded.

There's a good variety of pretend play toys, walker toys, mini ball pit, books and slides. Usually toys are strewn everywhere so you have to look for the one your kid likes to play with but there's so much variety that it's not a problem. It's nice that we can bring our adult drinks into the play area. Sometimes it can get very very busy though and really chaotic. The toys are suitable for kids 4-5 years of age. Some of them are a little worn and could use a battery change. Most parents and kids are really friendly and it's easy to make new parent friends there too. We had our birthday party there and it was really great to have the whole place to ourselves. They also gave us one of the party rooms to set up cake/games/decorations. All the kids really enjoyed their time at the party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cynthia L.

Unfortunately, we won’t be going back- good for kids 2 and under.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carli Manjorin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Wow! This place was amazing, I was really impressed. It is truly a hidden gem in Cary! I brought my 16 mo old here and she LOVED it. I also bought an iced mocha and it was one of the best I’ve had (which is saying a lot because I’m actually a teacher and barista part time so I’m picky 😂). The staff were so kind and friendly too. The bathrooms were super clean as was the lobby and play area. I really loved that they had a container to put all that toys that kids had in their mouth to further help keep the place clean and as sanitary as possible! I unfortunately don’t live in Cary anymore but anytime I return to visit my parents, we plan to stop by again! Again, awesome facility, we cannot recommend it enough.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christy Schwartz\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Alot of broken and dirty toys\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kim Ryan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Highly recommend this place for toddlers.

I love it all.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nathan Vey\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely great place to go to let kids hang out and for parents to relatively chill. Great safe toys. Some things could be better like cleaning up snack tables, preventing kids from opening maintenance doors and making sure batteries are working in toys. Also can be at capacity / crowded, with parents and kids who want to get 'in' crowding the lobby where kids would otherwise be snacking. In sum just get there super early ok?\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maggie Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute spot for kids to play and adults to chill!

This is the place to go for a break. Having a play area indoors for your kids while parents can watch from a coffee/beer/wine bar is brilliant. How are there not more of these. Please take my money. Prices are very reasonable. The facilities are very clean. My kids (aged 2 and 4) had a good time. The facility sells snacks for kids at reasonable prices too. Staff were very friendly. Kids could spend several hours here while the parents relax.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Manchester\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is fantastic! If you have kids under the age of 4 or 5 that need to run around and get some energy out, this is the place to go. Super clean and a nice variety of toys and play items. Of all the indoor play places in the area, I feel this is the best one for small walkers, like one year olds, and it can even be enjoyed by smaller babies that are just crawling.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley MacLachlan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love Bumble Brews!

The staff members were friendly and helpful, the space was clean, and the beverages were delicious. It’s not easy to find a place that both adults and kids can equally enjoy, but Bumble Brews meets that criteria. Everybody in attendance had a great time and raved about what a cool place it was.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vicki Rosenow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fantastic place to take your children!

I highly recommend bringing your young toddlers or crawlers here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Soula Sanderford\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: The Bumble Brews owner, whom I've corresponded with via email, and staff, whom we interacted with in person, were all very friendly. The actual inside of the establishment was very bright and clean. The coffee was not good in flavor unfortunately; the specialty coffees, including the dairy free options, tasted like plain unsweetened coffee, which was a disappointment. But there are 2 reasons my son will not be returning to play at Bumble Brews.\nFirst, the toys, on average, were more about imaginative play, such as playing kitchen/chef, rather than STEM play. Our 1.5 year old son was bored well before the 90 minute mark because none of the toys required critical thinking or a challenge. The obstacle/jungle gym equipment were impractical to use because of the mandatory sock policy. I completely understand the reasoning behind requiring socks to maintain cleanliness, but the children have no traction on wooden gym equipment, which becomes hazardous. My son recognized how slippery the wooden gym equipment was and wouldn't scale them. Perhaps adding adhesive traction grips to help with traction would be beneficial?\nAnd my second reason…there was an older child (maybe 7?) who appeared to belong to one of the staff working the cafe as they engaged on a familiar level. To put it plainly, she was a bully to my son and many of the other children trying to play. She had no parent shadowing her and when speaking to other parents who frequent Bumble Brews during our visit, we were informed that she is there often and her unpleasant behavior is the norm. I have issue with this if she truly is the child to one of the staff as it made it difficult for my husband and I to relax and allow our child to roam without concern. This child frequently tried to take toys from other children, including my son, and boss them around in an inappropriate tone. If her parent was shadowing her and trying to correct the behavior, I wouldn't have an issue, but without a parent shadowing her, we worried circumstances could escalate, making it challenging to mediate as I am not her parent and do not want to overstep. So instead, my husband and I had to continuously redirect our son away from wherever this child was playing.\nFor these 2 reasons, our experience was just okay. It is a 30 minute drive to reach this indoor children's play place and the good we experienced in our visit does not justify the drive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: CJ Sabin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Very fun indoor place for young ones to play.

The hours are 8-1 and 4-7 and you play for 1.5 hours. If you come frequently, there is also a monthly option. Parents and caregivers can purchase delicious coffee drinks made with Larry's beans or beer or juices or sparkling water. There are juice box options for the little ones and some snack items. The seating in the front area is also great for snacks and games and then you take off your shoes and play in the open space. There are all kinds of toys, a little kitchen, a slide and other objects to climb and jump. Our 2 year old loves the space and has a big smile on his face every time we approach the door. The owner and staff are extremely welcoming and kind. You can also book parties and events. I would follow them on facebook as well for the most up-to-date closure updates and announcements.

We go quite often and have even had the monthly membership in the past. Sadly my almost 4 year old is outgrowing the facility and gets bored after 30-45 minutes, especially with the younger age range that is generally there during the day. The cost is SUPER affordable and the coffee is always delicious. We haven't attended the events yet since we live 30 minutes away and they're always at night but hope to try in the future.\nMy ONLY issue is that toys are all over. I've tripped and my girl has fallen a few times over toys dropped by the kids and then just left there. Wish it was a little more tidy. Not asking that employees helicopter the place cleaning up after kids....that's just not reasonable😆 but maybe like every hour or so go through and pick up toys kids aren't playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison W.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This was just what Cary needed!

I drove my 1 year old 30 minutes and got turned away the minute we walked in for a private event.  You might want to inform customers when they call instead of wasting our time!  My toddler cried when we walked out because we couldn’t stay.  Please be more courteous and transparent, it’s really not hard.\n\n*also the woman I spoke to on the phone was very short with me.  I did not abruptly end the call, I said thank you and she said you’re welcome and that was it!  She had every opportunity to tell me that there was a private event starting in the next hour.  What really blew my mind is that I wasn’t offered any compensation when I got there and explained how disappointed I was.  I worked in hospitality and customer service for years and I would have 100% offered the customer a gift card in this case scenario.

Constantly having new events and toys!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonnay Wenger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Cutest little play area. Ideally suited for toddlers walking through 4/5 years old. The coffee was delicious and the employees were outstanding. Such a great addition for the community and a great option for parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laralee Lynch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: Nice play space for the littles with some tasty beverage options for the adults.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cassandra Hucke\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is perfect when the weather is not great outside, you are looking to have your baby socialize, and meeting other mommas. There are so many toys, make sure you bring a pair of socks, the drinks are good, and babies who are not mobile are free! Perfect place if you are looking to get out and avoid the weather or find friends.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erika Thurston\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Loves this place, my kid had so much fun there, everyone is super nice, the place is super clean, the chai latte is delicious! Great place for toddlers\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Terrie Best\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: I was here for my grandbabies first birthday party. I know all the children had a great time! This is a very cute little place for toddlers.  I would only say I would have liked to have seen more seating available for adults to be able to sit around the play area to watch the toddlers.I would definetly return.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Thomsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: Our Absolute Favorite Play Place. When the kids are feeling fussy and cooped up, but I don't want to leave the comfort of my own home - this is the ideal place to be. Plus, they offer coffee & tea, wine & beer on tap! Curling up on the couch with a hot chai, watching the kids play in a friendly, safe environment - it's everything I didn't know I wanted when I became a mom.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bob Stafford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: What a phenomenal place for a 1 year old to have the time of her life while parents also can take a break!!\nWe chose to take our daughter to have a play date while my wife and I relaxed in a clean, safe and comfortable atmosphere. We will be regular visitors and are excited to spend more quality time with our daughter!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Emerson-Marks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: This place is awesome! Super friendly employees, delicious drinks, and overall just a great atmosphere! We come often, and had my sons 2nd bday here. The owner is really kind. Just great vibes all around. Perfect for toddlers, especially when you just want to sit and relax, they can just play and you don't have to worry about them running off or anything. If you haven't been here yet, you need to!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Kendziorski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: This is a phenomenal place for parents and children! The play space is open which allows for a view of your child at all times. Nice and cozy lounge feel with some couch seating, tables, and bar area where you can sip a coffee..or beer/wine and unplug while the kiddos play. Blair is an amazing owner, haven't been once where she hasn't been in the building working alongside her employees. Everyone is friendly and personable. Two restrooms with changing tables as well. Forget your kiddos snack? No problem! Nice selection of kid friendly snacks and beverages too. Games, puzzles, books and coloring if the kids just want some downtime. So glad to have found this place. I share it with anyone I know.\n\nStill loving this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Dangerous\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: I'm hesitant to review because while this place is seriously wonderful and deserves all the accolades, it is such a hidden gem that never seems too busy and I'd love to keep it to myself!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Hanson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: The world needs more places like this!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elena Magay\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Bowerman\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A}",

From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by how clean and well-maintained everything was. It's clear that a lot of care goes into keeping the space safe, welcoming, and fun for little ones.\n\nWhat truly makes this place special, though, is Ashley. She is beyond amazing—so engaged and attentive to every child who walks through the doors. My 4.5-year-old and 2-year-old were instantly drawn to her warmth and enthusiasm. Whether she was helping them discover new activities, sparking their imagination, or simply making sure they felt welcome, her energy and dedication were undeniable.\n\nYou can tell this play area is run with love and thoughtfulness. It's organized, flows beautifully, and provides the perfect environment for kids to explore, play, and socialize. If you're looking for a top-notch indoor play space that feels more like a home than a business, this is the place!\n\nHighly recommend—we’ll be coming back again and again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Stromquist\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Absolutely loved this! Took my 4 and 1 year old and we all had a blast - the facility is clean, staff is kind and helpful, the toys and activities are so fantastic and give the kids opportunities to really dig in and PLAY, and they keep the capacity low enough that there were other kids for my littles to play with but none of us felt crowded. We’ll be back for sure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Hoffman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Teresa Lombana\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: My son Santiago attended their summer school program & Halloween activity. The staff, place & activities are amazing! They really go out & beyond to make the experience for the kids unforgettable. We live out in Lancaster & every time we’re able to we make the drive and try to attend their activities. 100% recommended. 😊 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerri Carder\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: I first met Ashley and her husband a few months ago when I took a CPR class, which was hands down the best, most informative CPR class I've ever taken! I knew my children would love it there too, so I dropped them off for a \"sensory science night\" and they had an amazing time! My husband and I enjoyed a quiet dinner alone and my boys didn't want to leave! They're already asking when they can go back :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin Studney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We have always enjoyed occasions to play at this facility.  It is clean, unique, varied, and stimulating without being overstimulating.\n\nMy daughter celebrated her 4th birthday there and we paid extra to have decorations and party favors done to match the theme.  I was blown away by how beautiful and special everything was made.  It was a great time for all.\n\nNothing with kids is cheap these days, but Spirited Sprout provided value for the cost.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lennae Ismari\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We have put our little one in Spirited Sprout Summer Camp for the past three years! It truly is something special.

We’re already looking forward to next year!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Connie Zeng\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our daughter attended her first summer camp at Spirited Sprout and she had a wonderful time together with the crew! The camp theme was “Around the World”, all week long they learned about different countries and their culture, sampled many unique food and created crafts to take home! We all enjoyed it so much and can’t wait to go back for more!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natasha Faber\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Spirited Sprout was the perfect venue for our little girl’s birthday party. Everyone loved the venue - the kids could play around freely while parents had a chance to sit and relax - it was an ideal and safe venue. Thank you to Ashley and Brad for helping us create very special memories with a first birthday party here in the US, it truly meant the world to us. Our girls love Spirited Sprout and we look forward to enjoying many more playtime hours and special events with the kids there 🤗\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellie Thigpen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We spend a day a week at Spirited Sprout!

Love this place!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebekah Dayton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My daughter recently had her birthday party here, and I 10/10 cannot recommend Spirited Sprout enough! There are various party packages to pick from, but the \"Extra Spirited Sprout\" package was worth every penny. It offered the most amount of play time for the largest group of people and Ashley took care of all the decor, place settings, party favors, setup, cleanup, etc. They know their space the best, and having them orchestrate everything was such a gift for a busy mama. They happily accommodated our special request for a party theme for our little as well! The space is so clean, organized and well thought out, and it offers a variety of play activities for children. Every single child of different ages that came to the party had such a fun time. We've also come to Spirited Sprout for a play reservation on a few occasions, which my child has loved as well. Thank you Spirited Sprout for offering such a unique and exciting space for littles to party and play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Atlas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Shout out to Brad! He is so attentive and my kids all love him!\n\nWe are frequent visitors of Spirited Sprouts and it is easily my 1 yr old and 3 yr olds favorite spot! Every inch of the space is well thought out and the owners do a great job of making everyone feel like family. It is always impeccably clean and they limit the number of families allowed at one time so it is never overly crowded. Our 3 year old has also attended their summer camp which we highly recommend. Each day had a different theme with the cutest activities, crafts, etc. He is already asking to go back. We are so grateful for Spirited Sprouts and all that they do to help foster the development of our little ones!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Paige\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I'm so glad we have Spirited Sprout in our community! It's a safe, clean, place to bring my 4 year old and 1 year old when we want to get out of the house. I love that it's small so I can always keep a close eye on my little ones, and I don't have to worry about it being over crowded. The owners are always so nice and involved as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erica Idstein\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Spirited Sprout is amazing! My son absolutely loves it there (started going at age 1) and I feel very safe taking him to play. Small play groups allowed each session so it isn’t overwhelming and everything is always SPOTLESS. The owners are kind and sweet, and we love supporting their small business.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ana Burnside\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We have been visiting Spirited Sprout for over 2.5 years now and it is hands down our favorite place to go! My son just finished a fun little 3 day camp and it was the most amazing experience! This was his first camp and I’m so impressed with how well it was organized! The owner Ashley and her husband Brad went above and beyond. I can’t recommend their camps enough and next summer we will definitely sign up for multiple!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This is a very well thought out play facility for kids.

Booked online before we arrived. It was perfect lots of interactive toys and stations. Safe and clean.  The owner was so nice and engaged with the kids so they would get the most of of the stations. 10/10 we will be back and will probably book a birthday party there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JAG Weston\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had our 2yo birthday party at Spirited Sprout & Ashley does an amazing job with the party package! In the play area- the kids can play til their hearts are content & when it’s time for cake/treats- she’s taken care of every detail! Making it so easy for parents to keep it simple yet adorable! Even the restroom has everything all age kids could need! (Changing table, kids potty seat & step stool) we totally recommend Spirited Sprouts for your next kids party or play day- all the parents agreed!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Peterson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Our children LOVE Spirited Sprout! I feel safe leaving my girls with Ashley and her team. Ashely is well educated and understands sensory processing disorder. My daughter has sensory issues and when she comes home from sprouts afternoon out, she is regulated and happy. If you’re a parent of a child with SPD or autism, you know how amazing it is to drop off your kids ( without crying or fear) and know they will benefit from more than just play and return home happy!!!!. I am so grateful for Ashley and her family. They put so much love into what they do and it shows. Thank you for everything!\nSteph and Luke Peterson\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Play Learn Grow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: As a former educator and now a mom to two littles, I cannot recommend Spirited Sprout, LLC enough for ALL children to enjoy a loving, clean, and well thought out sensory playground. Spirited Sprout has become a special part of our family as they have welcomed us with open arms, taught our daughter new skills, and has provided a place for our family to enjoy time outside of the home meeting other local families.

There is literally a space created  for all ages so my 6 month old twins could safely play and my 5 year old loved it! We can’t wait to come back for a play date. Ms. Ashley took care of every detail right down to the decorations and gift bags. I just brought our food and cake. She even took pics for us during the party and helped with our babies.  I’m so glad Waxhaw has an indoor play venue and the fact that it’s designed to help with development makes it that more special. Thank you Ms. Ashley!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan F\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Wonderful sensory playground!

So many play places have TVs going, music blaring, lights flashing... and for my kid this is way way way overstimulating.  Spirit Sprout is delightfully peaceful and quiet, neat as a pin and a relaxing atmosphere for kids and parents alike.  In fact, going to Spirited Sprout has become my daughter's choice as her reward for her Good Behavior Chart.  We always look forward to coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Weatherford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: We had such a great time at Spirited Sprout.

From start to finish, every detail was handled with care and professionalism, allowing us to truly enjoy the day without a single worry. The pricing was more than fair, but what truly stood out was the quality, attention to detail, and genuine commitment to bringing our daughter’s dream of a Princess Unicorn party to life. With 27 kids and parents in attendance, the food was a hit, the goodie bags were perfect, and the entire experience far exceeded our expectations.

We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i’m assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it’s too hot outside.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Micah Wolfe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We absolutely love this playground! Our kids loved it even more! (2 1/2 years old and 14 months old) They had a blast and did not want to leave! I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn’t even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend!

It is evident that Jason is a compassionate and truly caring individual who prioritizes the happiness and well-being of every child that enters the facility.\n\nOne aspect that immediately impressed me is the cleanliness of the place. The facility is always immaculate, and it's clear that great care is taken to maintain a safe and hygienic environment. The bathrooms are consistently clean, which is a big plus for parents like myself who value cleanliness and hygiene.\n\nI particularly appreciate the mandatory sock policy at We Rock The Spectrum. It not only promotes sanitation but also ensures the safety of the children. By requiring socks, the facility minimizes the risk of slips and falls, creating a secure environment for kids to play and explore.\n\nWe Rock The Spectrum in Kernersville is undoubtedly the perfect place for children to release their energy in a safe and controlled environment. Jason's commitment to providing a space for kids to have fun and get their wiggles out is truly commendable. His dedication to ensuring the happiness and well-being of every child is evident in the positive atmosphere and joyful experiences we've always had.\n\nIf you're a parent searching for a place where your kids can play safely and have a blast, I highly recommend We Rock The Spectrum in Kernersville. Jason's compassion, cleanliness standards, and emphasis on creating a fun and secure environment make it an exceptional choice. Your children will have a fantastic time while you enjoy peace of mind knowing they're in the best hands.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Felicia Booker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Wonderful place for children to play and to have a birthday party 🎉 Very safe. Plenty of parking. However, definitely be careful when leaving as the trees to the left will block your view. …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ely Vega\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The staff is super loving and nice, they have snacks and everything a child could need, my family loves the place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Wronoski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love it here, I bring my toddler on rainy or cold days when we need something fun to do.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yolanda Carpio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brought my 2 year old grandson to open play time and he loved it. The only bad part was that he didn’t want to leave and cried all the way home. I think we found his new favorite playground!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Hanover\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had my daughters 4th birthday party here. Everything was absolutely wonderful! Kids had a blast! Thank you for everything!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Misty Kimel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is amazing! I went to a We Rock the Spectrum near Raleigh for a birthday party, and I knew I wanted to have one at the Triad location for my son. I took my son to play to check it out and then quickly scheduled the birthday party afterwards. I HIGHLY recommend hosting a party here! It was so easy and everyone had so much fun! The owner is wonderful as well!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Casey Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Jay is an Incredible Gift to the community; he should be protected at all costs. I brought both of my kids there on several different occasions, and every time, he has met them with warmth, engaged with them, and created an environment that feels safe, sturdy, and connected. The atmosphere is always clean and well taken care of, and it feels like a short vacation where you can let the outside world escape and enjoy time with your kids. My daughter explicitly likes the zipline, but my son loves the toy car so much that we went out and bought him one for Christmas\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jess Skinner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: THANK YOU for the review!  Hope to see you soon!  Enjoy the Holidays.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatrice Kwok\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2 year old and I visited this little gem today and we had a blast! The sensory equipment was fun and safe. They have something for all age groups. There wasn't a huge crowd which I appreciated because my LO is slow to warm up and gets overwhelmed easily by a lot of people. Mr. J is kind, personable, and great with children! For 2 hours of play, the 3 class pass ($30) makes it affordable for our family. We live in NW GSO but it was worth the drive! My LO is now sound asleep and I am one happy Mama. 😊 I highly recommend visiting and supporting this local business!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jason Nicholson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place to play for your young kids. Winter, rain, playing outside is a no go. As well corralling twin two year old boys by yourself is difficult. Here, it's easy to corral them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linh Dieu\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: THANK YOU!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alisa Jamerson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My teenage son with nonverbal ASD got a gift card here, so we visited. He loved it! When we visited on a Sunday around noon, the place was quiet and a few families were visiting with their children. I love that my son was able to run, jump, swing, and bounce, and be himself. The prices to visit are very reasonable. I will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda McWhirter\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: LOVED our experience at We Rock The Spectrum! A MUCH needed space for kiddos like mine!

We have all our kids birthday parties there. They make it very easy on the parents, keeping track of the time, running the show and they clean up everything too which is so nice. Recently we did a private play date, it was a great time. Basically you rent out the indoor play space so it is only you and who you invite.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marilyn Beaver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We’ve visited WRTS on many occasions and for different reasons - birthday parties, summer camp, or just to play. It truly is a place for all ages and abilities. My daughter uses a walker and needs assistance getting around. Usually she tires or gets bored within 30 minutes when we visit play areas. At WRTS, she’s been entertained for hours! And because of the range of play equipment and activities, my younger son can climb, run, and swing as much as he wants! Jay and Jenny are wonderful and a great resource to the special needs community. You can tell this is an endeavor that is close to their hearts.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mike Amos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My son loves going there. Lots of activities and great staff. He is always excited to go.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Adams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We loved our time here today!  There's a gated little area for smaller kids which was perfect for my 10 month old but he also loved exploring the calming room and the swing area too.  So many fun toys like vacuums and kitchen, laundry, pizza oven, etc.  My son loved the toy cupcakes!  Fun zip line for kids that are a bit older, plenty to climb in and on and a nice enclosed trampoline as well.  Love that they offer something for everyone, whether on the spectrum or not.  Owner was friendly and engaged with everyone to make sure they were having a good time. We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S Gieseking\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: There are so many fun things to do here for children of all ages and abilities. My 7-year-old and 2 yr old had an absolute blast! They have a zip line that both of my kids absolutely loved! There is even a little play pizza kitchen, dolls, washer/dryer, and whole little house area set up! There is a calming area that is in a private room, away from all of the busier toys, that is perfect for children who need a quieter and calming space. This was the perfect place for a birthday party! There is a party room you can decorate and bring your own cake and food. You get to come 15 minutes before the party starts to set up. Socks are required for all, no shoes or bare feet, but you can wear your own, or you can buy a pair for $2.\nIt's most definitely worth the drive from Winston or Greensboro for such an amazing indoor space that is sure to be a fun filled day for all children!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Craycraft\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank you so much for the review. \nSee you soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Victaria Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank you so much...hope everyone had a great time.

Jay and his family are so sweet and very considerate of everyone's needs. You can tell they love people and made a point to spark conversation with many of my guests. The place was super clean and the bathrooms were very nice and up to date ( that is a plus in our family). I forgot a few things like napkins 🤦‍♀️ and they gave me a huge stack to use. I look forward to coming back for playdates with my friends. Thank you for a special day!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madeline Nelson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I took the child that I nanny this week and she absolutely loved it.

Don't forget your socks. ❤️ Thanks for an awesome visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katykins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We visited for the first time today and my 3.5 year old and 9 month old just loved it. It’s hard to find a place that both of them can find something to enjoy and play with. There was a great little area where my 9month old just sat and played with toys for a long time. They had some awesome swings for kiddos his age, his favorite was the bulldozer swing. My big guy just couldn’t get enough of the trampoline and loved playing with the little pizza oven and cash register. Such a great space and so clean. The owners were so interactive with the kids! We  had a blast and will be back soon. Thanks so much for creating such a fun and safe environment for kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jared stone\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is amazing!

Jenny and Jay are outstanding individuals who are changing lives in this community. This gym is filled with smiles, love,  laughter, support, inclusion, and inspires confidence in kids. My son with Sensory Processing Disorder absolutely thrives here.  Swings, a zip-line, trampoline, crash pads, calm room,  toddler area-- it's perfect! My 12 month old also loves the toddler area!  We had a birthday party here and all of the kids said it was the \"best party ever!\". We're also in Summer Camp and it has been such a positive experience. Camp has helped my son grow so much and the amazing camp staff has gone above and beyond.  This gym has changed our lives for the better,  and we're so thankful.  Highly recommend for ALL kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austin Bisbee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank You for your review.  Love having you guys at the Gym.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nannette Gulledge\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: This is an amazing indoor facility for all kids but especially those with any sensory disorder.  There are several types of swings, a trampoline, zip line, slides and squishy (pillow) walk area.   One wall has mirrors so kids can watch themselves and another has a busy board.  There's an area with mega blocks and sliding beads and other sensory toys.  There's also a road rug and cars, mini kitchen, pizza oven,  washer/dryer, shopping cart, and so on.   Such a great judgement free place for call kids where they can be kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James Melton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My son Brody and I really enjoyed our first visit today! I was looking around for a place to take him where he would have plenty of space to crawl around and play. This place is very safe and clean. The owner Jason is a super nice guy and was very welcoming. We are looking forward to more visits in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abi M she-her\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My 3yr olds favorite place!

They have created such a welcoming environment for ALL kids. They are very interactive with customers and love to connect with people.\n\nThe gym itself has a variety of sensory play equipment which can be enjoyed by kids of all capabilities and ages.   My daughter has non-speaking autism and this gym has been a safe space for her to play and interact with other kids.\n\nWe couldn’t be happier with our experience at We Rock The Spectrum Triad.  Our community is very fortunate to have a gym that caters to kids on the spectrum.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Neale\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Jason & Jen were so welcoming! I took my 2.5 year old son for a morning session. There is a safe play space for babies and an area with toddler toys in addition to all of the swinging, climbing, and jumping equipment. The facility also has separate spaces for parties and/or classes.\n\nMy son takes a bit to warm up to new experiences but by the end of our visit he was loving the trampoline and twirling swing. We look forward to returning during our summer visit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: mark jeacoma\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Place was a great safe area for the kids.

Have also done a birthday party here and it was well worth the money. It's alway super clean and smells great and there is a great variety of inflatables for the kids to play on. Can't wait to continue to make lots of memories with my kids here!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Watkins\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: DO NOT GO HERE!!! My friends girl and my girl were being scared by a little boy, we told them to ask him to stop. He didn’t listen so my friend and I asked him to stop and he still didn’t stop and then he started pushing and corning them with his arms on either side of them so they couldn’t get away! We told him that was not ok and then confronted his parents. He still pursued them and so we told his parents again. Now, non of this so far is the business fault but then the owner steps in while we were talking with his parents and says we should’ve come to her and not “ yelled at her customers, that this little boy comes all the time and is just fine.” My friend says” but he is pushing our girls” and the owner just argues back and it it obvious that she is upset and that this little boy is being backed up and will not stop. so we start to leave and the owner follows us out the door, still yelling, telling us not to come back. This is not the kind of place you want to bring your kids, if this is just one instance of how the owner of the business acts! That is not ok!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JENNIFER LIPSEY\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: Such a fun place. We  brought our boys here for an hour to burn off some energy!

After visiting Playland, it’s clear what a clean,  safe kids’ space is supposed to look like.\n\nI worked at Just Play for about a year, and I would not recommend it — especially to parents. The toddler area in particular is filthy. There’s dust built up under the benches — right where babies crawl and play. Snacks like Goldfish or Cheerios are always left on the ground, which is a choking hazard and completely unsanitary. Inside and under the main play structure, there are piles, PILES of dust that have clearly been there for months, if not longer.\n\nAll of this is expected to be cleaned by the staff, who are paid just $12 to $15 an hour and mostly under 18. The owner, Beth, refuses to hire professional cleaners and instead gives us cheap, ineffective cleaning tools to do the work ourselves. No matter how hard we tried, it was never enough to please her. The owner is out of touch and inconsiderate. She treated us like we were disposable and expected us to clean up years of built-up filth like it was just part of our job — I realized that work shouldn’t be this dreading as a 18 year-old and left.\n\nIf you’re a parent reading this, I highly recommend going to Playland instead. It’s spotless, smells clean, and everything is bright white — so you can see the difference. Your child deserves better, and so does the staff expected to care for them. Give your money to businesses that deserve it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Scott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 days ago\nReview: This place was great! Fairly clean,  and my kids enjoyed it. Wish there was more play area! Other than that great experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karlee Lawless\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 4 days ago\nReview: There was a high pitched noise the whole time we were there. Kind of like the sound that a lot of older people can’t hear that are put outside buildings to prevent people from loitering.\nWe must wear socks but the socks are black by the end of the two hours so the place is dirty. They were so nice to give us a pair of socks for each child but it was right before we were about to leave. :(\nThey put in massage chairs, claw machines and a few games you have to pay for. If I wanted to do that we would have gone to chuckie cheese.\nAll in all the kids had a blast but mama didn’t.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natsuki\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: Thank you for the review!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Monge\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Just Play offers an exceptional experience, with staff who are like a second family to my children. They consistently provide a warm and nurturing environment, ensuring every child feels safe and supported. The team's enthusiasm is contagious, as they actively participate in games and activities. The General Manager and lead staff member are standouts, showcasing remarkable hospitality and kindness. The overall atmosphere is electric and unparalleled.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katrina Dunlap\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We had a fantastic experience at **Just Play Charlotte** today! I visited with my three children, two of whom are on the autism spectrum, and I was truly impressed by how welcoming and accommodating the staff were. The general manager, **Antonio**, went above and beyond to make sure our visit was smooth and enjoyable. He was incredibly friendly, patient, and helpful—he truly made us feel at ease.\n\nThe facility itself is clean, safe, and full of fun, sensory-friendly activities that kept all three of my kids engaged. It's not always easy to find places where children with diverse needs can feel comfortable and included, but Just Play delivered in every way. Thank you, Antonio and team, for creating such a supportive and joyful environment. We’ll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tori Patterson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This place is amazing for kids! It’s always clean and inviting. The employees are always nice and inviting!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kailani Genaro\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: This place did not feel clean and isn’t really toddler friendly. All there is in the toddler area is dirty stacking blocks that the older children step all over and inflatable balls. It is not monitored. My 1 year old was pushed because older kids were in and out of the area and staff didn’t address it at all.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carson Douglas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Fun place to have a kid's birthday party!

There also is an area just for the 3 and under young ones, who will enjoy all the same equipment, just pint- sized and perfect for little hands and legs.\nThere is a counter where pizza/ chips/ and all sorts of candy treats are available...w/ different drinks too. And there is a party area...to have a whale of a good time and invite your child's friends too. All in all, JUST PLAY is a good value at 13.00 for 2 hours of super charged fun!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Jackson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Just play started out great. In the last few months I've had numerous issues with there apps not awarding points. I contacted support on each one and was never given points owed. Obviously it's not much probably adds up to a few dollars but I worked days to reach those goals and now I just can't trust just play. I'm definitely telling anyone it's like a carnival buildup game it's starts great and ends with you feeling ripped off. Absolutely garbage.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dandrenna Shellay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Kymani my host!! Zion, and Antonio was very pleasant!!

It is very beautiful establishment, very clean, with many things to do!! The staff is beyond helpful and kind, they are even so fantastic and lovely when it comes to the kids, my baby brother i brought here keeps talking about how “nice” they were! The GM here, Antonio was so darling to talk to, very charismatic and helped me with the issue i had with the machines! They refunded me for any issue I had at all, and they so didn’t have to! Jessica was also a fabulous help, she refunded me the additional person I paid here because I did not know adults were free! She helped us with sizing of our socks, and with concessions! I will 10/10 recommend this place to anyone with children, it’s very inexpensive for everything it offers. I will be back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: x.alasia\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Booked a party package for $600+ and called to confirm, but nobody ever answerer. I have called over 6 times and I haven't gotten an answer yet. I am at the point where I am just going to get a refund and book somewhere else.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brian Steedley\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the review! What can we do to make it a 5 star experience next time?\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leanne\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We took our toddler son to play here, and discovered that the staff don’t moderate access to the toddler area whatsoever. By the time we left, there were at least 5-6 kids in the toddler area who were well above toddler age (probably 7+ years old?) and throwing the foam blocks around and yelling. It's also extremely loud in here--they don’t seem to have any sound dampening, and since the walls are concretes and the ceiling is high, I had a headache after less than 2 hours between the loud music and all the screaming children.\n\nThey need more loose parts for the older children to play with, as the toddler area looked to be the only area that had blocks or balls. It seems like a lot of things are due for replacement/maintenance as well.\n\nI would consider coming back when my son is older, but I have to say that there are nicer play areas in Charlotte that are better maintained and have more things for kids to do. If you have a kiddo who loves obstacle courses and climbing, this place has a decent selection for that. I don’t recommend it for younger children though.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly Gearin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Friendly staff. Clean inside.

What can we do to make it better?\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Micah R\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I was there the other day and a very rude manger was there. A female employee was told to go clean the men’s restroom while it was occupied. She explained that she was uncomfortable doing so and the manger proceeded to yell at her. He only stopped yelling when he saw that another customer was recording. The stairs to the place structure were also wet when I was there. So my kids couldn’t play. The  staff was very nice but that manger should be fired he was very for how unprofessional, he was being.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Altum\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: This place has gone to hell. We used to bring my oldest all the time, but we will not be coming back again. Everything is falling apart, multiple safety hazards, they have 2 people working the entire place on a very busy day, one of which didn't even look like they were working. I tried to order a coffee, which was on the menu, to be told that \"to be honest, neither of us know how to use that machine\". I don't know if they just didn't want to do it, or if they were training on it, but regardless, it was upsetting. My son had fun, but I feel like nothing ever gets cleaned and there are multiple safety issues\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rish\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: TERRIBLE PLACE!!! This past weekend I was so excited to celebrate my daughter’s birthday, after purchasing from (Groupon) a birthday package. After calling and confirming the date that I needed, I was told that it was booked. Immediately I went to cancel the party package because of course it wasn’t needed at that point, and proceeded with the refund process. However, you can’t get in contact with anyone from Groupon!!! I tried calling Just Play to see if they could contact anyone to help with the process and I was told there is nothing that could be done on their end because it’s a third party, even though they are doing contracts with them to promote the deals!! I will be taking legal action, because there is no way that either company has rights to my money!!! DISGUSTING!!! Don’t waste your time or money with these FRAUDS!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Mongillo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff was very kind and helpful.

Drove about 50 minutes from Newton. Absolutely fantastic experience. Some reviews calling this place dirty? Absolutely not !!!!\nVery clean, well organized, and supervised. Staff was very nice. Nobody’s kids were bullying others. (That’s a parenting issue by the way).\nGreat place. Reasonably priced. Definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hector Jrg\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Too good to be true. The workers at this indoor playground are the ones who make/keep the place feel  joyful, social and welcoming. However the owner Beth hutton would make it extremely difficult on her workers to keep it that way when she would make astonishing requests to her workers such as using a hand held vacuum and vacuuming the wall trim or using oxiclean foam on floors tiles and scrubbing till lighter color. Which could be best for the environment/guest but there’s a lack of compassion for the workers. You didn’t get professional/experienced  cleaners let alone, provide your staff with the proper equipment to complete the tasks you ask of them. Tiles on floor get socks moist/stained, unstable furniture, dust all in the play area fencing. A remodel would be a better option rather then making workers deep clean/polish everyday. Overall it’s just a gentrified park reselling dollar tree snacks. Recommend going to freedom park\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hailey Morris\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This shopping center has a big homeless problem and they’ve begun parking outside of this Just Play location with shopping carts and pacing in front of the entrance. One homeless person perched himself on the window the last time we went and was talking to himself while pointing at the kids playing inside.\nWe like coming here, but it feels less and less safe every time we visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristina Svirina\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: so dirty, it's so dirty there that my socks and my child's socks had to be thrown away, they wouldn't wash off. as well as the child's beige pants, the knees on the pants were so dirty. I don't understand how this place works, why haven't they closed them down? They don't clean there at all and don't wipe down the play surfaces. I personally am disgusted to take my child to this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brianna Lemire\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Fun and clean facility!

We've been here quite a few times and we're always so impressed with the customer service. In particular, there are 2 gentlemen who are usually working and they are both AMAZING!! I don't know their names, but one of them has tattoo sleeves and the other one has long dreadlocks. They greet the kids and parents with the same warm smiles and enthusiasm every single time. They also walk around pretty frequently to make sure everyone is being safe, to clean up the seating areas, and they carry themselves so professionally. Just Play has consistently been a great place to bring our kids, so thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Faith French\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 11 months ago\nReview: It is a great place to take the kids.

Lots of fun, friendly people working, cool playground for the kids.\n**Edited: this playground was super clean, that's why my son could lick handrails while playing.

I played this for a very long time and still playing it. Thanks Just Play🥰\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Hlifka\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is amazing and the kids love it.  BUT seriously, $3.25 for a water.  I can totally afford it, but why should I pay that much for water.  This is ridiculous and I'm not sure if I should blame the owner or our current President for paying this much for water.  1 star until that price drops, sad but true.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Drew West\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the five star review, Drew!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Press\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We just had our son’s 5th birthday party here and the level of attention the staff provided outweighs any other birthday venue we’ve used in the past.

Thank you for providing us with this great experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James Haston\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We (me and my 2 year old daughter) had a great time here on a Sunday afternoon, it was a little crowded, and hectic. But what do you expect in a room full of kids. You just have to stay close by to your child. Or at least I did because anything can happen. They had food, drinks, & snacks (bags of chips, pizza, chicken nuggets, pretzels, soda, & candy). It was a great time for us. My 2 year old had an absolute blast. And I loved that there was a section for my toddler to play in and not get trampled by all the other sugar rushed youngins. Everything seems well maintained & clean for the most part. The employees were nice and had smiles on their faces. Clean bathrooms and padded floors. Good prices & monthly memberships. This is not a place for the parent to come relax. This is a place for the children to come have fun. And that's exactly what happened. If your a parent and care about your child. You need to be with them and watch them to keep them safe. Its not the staffs job to watch your child for you. It's the parents job. I've seen other posts about this place where a child was hurting another child, or pushed them or something. (Kids will be kids)  That's why you need to be with your child at all times! And the fault lies not with the venue, but with the parent of the mean child. If this occurs. I won't be dealing with the venue. I'll be dealing with that child and their parents myself. That's what anyone should do in that situation. With that being said. It would be cool to have attentive staff. But I understand places get crowded. And there might not be enough staff available. Long story short. We had fun. And we will return whenever we have the time. 😁\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: L.

Aged 11,7,4,2, and there was something for each one to do. The toddler area was great with the gate, so i didn't have to chase the teo year old across the place, lol. My kids only wished they had a ball pit, but they still had a ball.  We paid for two hours for our four kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawn M.\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Kids had a great time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jay McDaniels\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Some older kids were running and playing in their shoes in the toddler area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marlon\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impression was this place is crowded but then it was still cold outside so perfect for the kids to play inside, there were lots of fun stuff to keep them occupied for a few hours (2 hrs) tickets. Place was generally clean including restrooms, only issue I had was that the flooring transitions are not marked or colored (highlighted) the kids seem to have a good fun time here. There is also a  snack counter and refreshments on sale. Pack your own little bags and don’t forget your socks it’s $3.50 per sock. There were adequate seating and chairs. Nice play for the kiddos to hang out but use more fun activities.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Daly\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son and I really enjoyed this place. He’s only 2, and even at his young age the toddler section was very enjoyable for him; he must’ve gone down that slide quite seriously thirty or forty times! He loved playing with the foam blocks, and going to the higher areas of the structure as well.\n\nThey had clean facilities (he needed a diaper change) and had dedicated diaper disposal so it didn’t stick up the room. The whole place was actually surprisingly clean and seemed to me to be very well maintained.\n\nIt’s not expensive, but if you go more than once a month the yearly membership is a great option, and we might have to look into it. Workers and all the other parents and kids present were friendly and it seemed like a safe environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla87\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Kids love it!!!

The party attendant appeared to be inexperienced and struggled with basic responsibilities:\n\n1. I was informed I need to purchase a $5 pitcher of water, despite the package including two pitchers.\n\n2. After clarifying, the attendant brought the water but forgot cups, plates, and utensils. I had to request these separately, specifying quantities.\n\n3. Unfortunately, I found myself unexpectedly managing party supplies instead of enjoying the celebration, contrary to our expectations that the attendant would handle such tasks.\n\n4. When it came time to serve pizza, the attendant simply left plates and pizza boxes without offering assistance. When I inquired about serving hungry kids, her response suggested surprise at my request.\n\n5. There was no help in setting up the table for cake cutting, and I ended up serving the cake without assistance. (There is no private room . It is just a private open spot , which is okay)\n\n6. The attendant was often at the counter helping other customers rather than focusing on our party needs.\n\n7. Despite requesting a party attendant, I was met with confusion. The attendant insisted she was there to help, but her actions suggested otherwise.\n\n8. The pizza size was inadequate for five kids, leaving everyone unsatisfied.\n\nDespite these challenges, the saving grace was the manager's responsiveness. She patiently listened to my feedback during checkout and offered compensations such as 2-hour free play coupons and a discount on additional pizza. While the manager's actions were commendable, the overall experience fell short of expectations.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Steven Schwark\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the review, Steven!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the review, RG!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oluchi “Lady O” Thomas\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I recently celebrated my daughter's 3rd birthday at Just Play and it was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a party venue (which I guess isn't saying that much since she is only 3 lol but hear me out...)\n\nI was assigned a party planner but then another young man insisted that he wanted to be the host - since he was so anxious I agreed. Turns out he was very inexperienced - long story short the pizzas were brought out too early (some of my guests hadn't even arrived yet) I had to fight for a fresh order so the kids wouldn't be eating cold food. I had to fight for extra plates, forks and napkins and when they finally did arrive they didn't even match my color scheme. I had to ask several times for them to make an announcement for my guests to come to the area for the party, I had to literally go to Big Lots next door to purchase my own hand sanitizer (which delayed everyone eating). I had to serve the pizza myself - using forks because they couldn't be bothered to assist. And to make matters worst my \"party host\" couldn't find a lighter. He said I had to get everyone on my own to sing happy birthday and cut the cake and I had to ask all of the dads if they had matches. My sweet baby loves to pretend and \"blow out\" candles but it almost didn't happen. Luckily my original planner was able to find a lighter for me.\n\nThe point of having a party at a venue like this is so that the parents could relax - I couldn't do that. I had my own plates, had to buy my own hand sanitizer, had to serve the food and beg someone for a lighter. For all of that I could just have a party at home. Will never host a party here again. My friends were the ones helping me clean up at the end!\n\nThe manager tried to make things right (charged for a party of 10 instead of 15) so I appreciate her effort but I am still so upset by how much I had to work for as much as I paid to have my \"party host\" do his job.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawn Akuforngwe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the review, Shawn!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Batlle\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The set up is nice, but there’s a severe lack of sanitation here.

Don't get trapped in the monthly subscription. If you try to take your child to play on the weekend (when most parents get the chance because they work during the week) 9 times out of 10 when you get there and walk in and your child sees all the other children playing they will tell you that you and your child CANT come in because they are filled to capacity and they have also have birthday parties scheduled ALL DAY so there's not going to be any time available for your child to come play. When you ask to cancel your subscription because the last 4 times you've tried to come you've been turned away they will tell you that there's a 1-800 number you have to call to cancel your subscription and they conveniently DO NOT have that number for you EVER!!! So I go online to see if I can find the number and all I can find is something telling me I can cancel my subscription if I pay for the following 2 months right now but that's it there's no option to do that and there's definitely not a phone number anywhere to cancel anything. If you have the convenience of going during the early day on a week day you might enjoy this place and be lucky enough to actually go INSIDE and play but if your free time is on the weekends then don't bother. Save your time and money.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lipika Mohapatra\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the review, Lipika!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ishan Brahmbhatt\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the review, Ishan!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sherry Sechrist\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the great review!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Pfeiffer\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you for the good review!

I bring my granddaughter quite often and these are all new faces and not d friendly at all . I saw Emily the full 2 hours sweeping and wiping down tables . Hopefully they will do better next time or I’ll ensure my granddaughter gets food and drink beforehand, the woman on the photo is the manager in black who was at the register and when I walked up after she was finished with the customer walked away with 2 others, outside of the staff’s unprofessionalism my granddaughter had a  great time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Hartman\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Not the best place for kids under 3 as there are a lot of older kids and they rarely stay out of the little kids area. Also most of the play area was built using darker colors so its hard to spot your kid in there sometimes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Geoffrey Streater\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is mainly for older kids. Also I wouldn’t come here as the employees don’t monitor the kids like they do at skyzone or other play centers. A little kid was hitting and shoving other kids for 45min and the staff didn’t say anything until the kid pushed my 2 yr old down the stairs. They didn’t even acknowledge it until we said something. They offered to give us a refund but NEVER got it. If u go here PLEASE make sure u can follow your kid inside all of the play houses if they are younger.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mhd Hafez\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The place is decent and clean, the variety is not that much, when it's get crowded the kids may get bored.

This is not really the place for 4 and under.  The toddler area is pretty high and has large blocks to build but are heavy enough to hurt a small child.  It’s very dark up in the play area.  Lots of kids crying trying to get out.  Staff all chatting up front not sure of their role but manning some of the areas for safety would be one choice.  Bathrooms need a good clean !!! Also said no outside food or drink as they have a ‘cafe’ but only sells nachos and junky snacks!!!! Won’t be back !!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I loved this place!!! We took two 5 year olds, a 4 year old and a 3 year old. Everyone had a blast, including the adults! You can play with the kids!! I found it somewhat difficult to move my big butt through some of the spaces but it was a absolute blast! One of the employees told me “looks like you’re having more fun than the kids!” Haha! I made some new friends here with some parents and kids. The 4 year old made herself a couple new friends. All the kids and adults got along really well. It did seem a little chaotic with everyone running around but I did see employees supervising things.. from what I saw.. they did a really good job! Everything was clean and well maintained! Will definitely return! I would highly recommend Just Play in Charlotte!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B Fra\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great place for little kids to place out of the summer heat.

I brought my grandson in today. He was excited about everything. Until he wasn't. Not the fault of the other kid  accidents happen. They have this wrecking ball you can swing on. We were getting ready to go in the ball pit they have. The opening to the ball pit is way to close to where the kids can swing. So my 19 month old grandson got hit in the head, by this kid swinging. Plus the kid didn't even say sorry. Parents r supposed to be watching their kids. Like I said it was an accident. But not teaching the kids to say sorry, and not watching your kid as well. But we won't be back for a while unless theyu have age group for kids set up. The owner gave me an ice pack that wasn't even cold. I shared with her what happen and she just kinda said \"O\". Just thought it could be handled better. But again cool place. Just not for the young ones. If you want to run go to the rec centers or to the parks.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James hurley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great people 👍 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivy Nguyen Trenor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciarra\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It was just the two of us, Koko and me, me and Koko. There was so much to do in there. Imagination haven indeed. I'm glad we came. We really enjoyed ourselves. And the host was so pleasant, he allowed us to stay a little longer and play while he was setting up for a party. So nice.

Clean and fun.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelsi Grant\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I love the intentionality behind their play areas here! The imaginative play opportunities are endless and there are so many different options for different interests! I also like how some areas encourage independent play for the littles while others are setup for parents to join in on the fun and really play with the kids! The whole space is clean, well kept, and feels open even though each play area feels like it is it's own space. So well managed! My 5 and 3 year old love it here and ask to go to open play weekly, lol!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick Richardson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Absolutely fantastic place for parties.

This play place is mostly geared toward the younger set. Probably under age 10 but it depends on how much your kid enjoys imaginary play. My four and six year olds absolutely adore it. The play areas change around periodically but there’s usually a vet center, play kitchen/grocery store, a magic spell booth, puppet show, and a few small games (skee ball, fooseball, basketball) in the back plus a foam pit, small ball pit, trampoline, and a variety of ninja foam blocks to jump and a roller slide and mountain to climb. Also the front area has one of those interactive coloring areas that animates your drawing on a big projector screen. Plus some tables full of building toys. There are plenty of places to sit and chat with other parents while staying within range of your kids. I’m always impressed with how clean they’re able to keep it and how chill the vibe usually is. At our last visit they added a new room full of airtoobz machines which kept my four year old busy for most of the play session. They also added a “snowball fight” area where you could pelt each other with tiny fluffy balls. I ended up in there with both my kids and nephew having the best time. It’s a really great place to go let your kids have a fun without being overstimulated and blasted in the face with screens and lights and ending the day in a meltdown. It gives wholesome playdate vibes and I just adore it. It’s really what the children’s museum in Portsmouth wishes it could be. If you’re a family with a quiet calm child it’s amazing. If you’re a family with a wild animal child climbing the walls and trying to parkour off every surface in your home it’s amazing. Bring em both. They’re gonna love it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jill Queen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: What a great place for kids to stay fully engaged for the two hour open play. They had foosball, skeeball, basketball and ice hockey in the back, great for those a little older. The variety of physical play (foam pit, ninja jumping), imaginary play (pet shop, wizardry, pirates), and interactive floor and wall space was great. We found it very clean too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We loved our time at the Play Spot! We went during Open Play. There was so much to do. My 4 year daughter loved the ball pit and the puppet show area.

Lots of fun for kids of all ages & the adults can join in too. Whether it’s an open play session, private event or birthday party, this place offers a great experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kadesha Fox\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: 10/10 recommend! Great play place for all ages, including adults. Great customer service & the kids always have fun (they love the gifts they get when leaving). The Open Play sessions are held at convenient times. The birthday party set up and experience is seamless and we will be having our twins next birthday here & can’t wait for all their friends to try it out. The Ninja Warrior class is for ages 6-10, which our kids can’t attend yet but look forward to signing them up for it. The private rentals are great for daycares, summer camps & school with a reasonable price. The one year anniversary party is coming up next week & my kids are excited to try out the new inflatable balloon bubble house. There is even a black Friday sale of punch cards giving 50% off open play admission, which we will be taking advantage of. Overall, this is a great place to take kids of all ages to have fun & run out some energy. Give it a try, you won’t regret it! :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Cadenhead\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The Play Spot is phenomenal. I have taken all three of my kids there and have even gone back with nieces and cousins. This place came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others. The activities are versatile and suit all ages. The adults even have fun. The reason I have rated The Play Spot 5 stars is because it is unique, CLEAN, and they always have something new to play with.  If you're looking to have fun with the whole family, this is the spot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: marissa roebuck\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We love The Play Spot!

The whole family can enjoy it and there really isn’t another place like it in Hampton roads. It’s like a mini version of the children’s museum in Portsmouth. We also hosted our daughter’s 7th birthday party here and it is very reasonably priced. Booking the party was easy and set up was a breeze. Everyone we invited had a great time. The only thing I would change is more time slots! We love it here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather Sarnavskiy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So much fun stuff!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sammy Dobschuetz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a great time at The Play Spot. We had our daughter's birthday party that had a wide range of ages. The Play Spot was able to keep all kids and adults engaged. The policy that has parents stay was strange to begin with, but I think the parents had more fun than the kids. Amber, our host, was so helpful and made all the families feel very welcomed. The birthday set up was great as we were the only ones there. We did not have to worry about other guests infringing on our fun. We highly recommend The Play Spot for parties and for even a play spot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Washington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: What a cute little spot with so much to discover! My eight and two year old were equally entertained the entire 2 hours. Also, management was really accommodating with me having to reschedule. Very clean and enjoyable for all ages. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anthony Phipps\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We've brought our special needs daughter here multiple times and she has always had a blast. The toys are good quality and well taken care of. The attractions change regularly it seems so it doesn't get stale for the kiddos. The staff is always polite. Great place for a quick family outing with the young ones.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katia Means\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for kids and parents to play together!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We booked for my son’s 5th birthday party and the kids had a BLAST.  Amber was our party host and she did a great job providing our party schedule and straightening up as the kids played. We brought our own food and decorations. Highly recommend for ages 12 and under. Even my teenagers that were there had fun playing. Lots of make believe, games, and things to climb on. This place could accommodate around 15 kids for the party and it was way better than previous parties at large play places because it was more than just a play ground (in my opinion).\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: fallon Harrison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Awesome spot, very clean.

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times.

We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way.

Reservation was super easy online and the staff was so helpful to ensure everything went smoothly. The extra hands with setup/cleanup was a godsend. Everyone had a blast and we are already planning  for another birthday in Sprouts next year!  HUGE SHOUT OUT to Jada and Garryin at Sprouts for making this birthday a fantastic experience for all!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kennie Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Amazing place. Full of sensory items, learning tools and safe equipment to burn energy and keep the mind stimulated. Loved the swinging apparatuses that even helped to calm my 3 and 5 year old admist all of the fun. Highly recommend and hope we get one in DFW!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Glynis Litwin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The playground is fun and the workers look like they enjoy their job. My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

I guarantee they will love it especially now because it’s so hot outside. Sprouts is a great alternative to a traditional playground and they accommodate all ages up to 6 years old. Go check them out they’re great!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Young\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jade M Pettit\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cute and low stress place to bring your kiddos!!

Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back.

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! Wonderful atmosphere and great sensory toys and activities for kids! The staff had amazing energy and did several organized dances for the kids (baby Shark, Gracie’s Corner) and played lots of great music for them!

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff is very nice, layout is wonderful and super clean.

They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Eubanks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great space!

My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience!

My daughter has had so much fun here over the years.  However, never buy gift cards online.  It has been almost two weeks since I ordered them.  After a lot of back and forth about them because the online ordering system was terrible and only the owner knows how to issue them despite the employee I spoke to having had worked at the gym for at least five years I expected to receive my digital gift certificates within a few days. Not has now been almost two weeks and my last follow up email was met with the response of, „what gift certificates.“ I so frustrated because there goes $45 down the drain and one of the families it was intended for are stuck in a hotel with two toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shannon Kasmierski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Quiet, nice place for a toddler\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: adrian williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Langlois\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I take my daughter a couple times a month to play and interact. It's only $15 for her to play with all their toys and indoor playground equipment all day as long as she wants. I asked about the daycare they offer and after a lot of thought I decided I'd give it a try. The day I went in for drop off, Z was working. She gave me so much assurance, and texted me updates throughout the 2 hours my daughter was there. Z knew I was nervous and went above and beyond to give me comfort and assurance. She treated my baby (17 months) like she's known her her whole life. I was pleasantly surprised when i got back to my daughter refusing to leave, which she's never done before. I can see that my daughter had fun and that Z doesn't do just the bare minimum. Later that evening she even texted me saying that my daughter made her day, which was another thoughtful surprise. Would 100% recommend. I have no experience with the other workers other than the regular play days, which has also been a nice experience.. But I would feel very comfortable and confident trusting Z with my daughter. The 2 hours she spent with her made a positive impact. Very glad I went in on the day I did.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rob and Fara Oakley\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I wanted to share my recent experience regarding our reservation for my son's birthday. While the lady who assisted us initially was friendly and accommodating, the follow-up call for confirmation was quite unpleasant. This caller claimed to be the one who helped with our reservation, which was not the case.\n\nThe original representative said it would be ok to arrive 10 minutes early for setup, despite the contract stating setup time was included. I've had friends celebrate at this venue, and they've been allowed those few extra minutes without extra charges. This isn't our first birthday party, and we've never encountered issues with early setups before. I am not saying 20-30 minutes prior; I am talking 10 minutes prior.\n\nI understand that rules exist for a reason, but a little kindness can really enhance the customer experience. I suggest the management consider adjusting the scheduling to allow parents a few extra minutes for setup before guests arrive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taneisha Willis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Really great place.

I recently had my kid's joint bday party there Saturday 8/17. Positives- The employee that day (I forgot her name) was extremely helpful and kind. She was always checking in to see if we were ok and needed anything. I greatly appreciated that. Tons of activities for kids to do and they had SO MUCH FUN! The party room is nice but would not realistically seat 30 people at one time. It was a little crowded inside the party room.\n\nNegatives- The entire facility on the weekends is reserved for private parties only from 9-2. There is a set amount you pay for a certain amount of hours and then $50 for each additional 30 mins. This does NOT include set up or breakdown time. I booked the space for 10am-1:30pm. Therefore, no one could have a party before or after me. The party was 11am-1pm. In my opinion, set up time and breakdown should be included. I should not have to pay an additional $100 to get there at 9am to set up when I have already reserved the space for the party. Trying to rush and set up in 1 hour was extremely stressful and a buzz kill. Additionally, the AC was not on when we arrived at 10 so we were sweating carrying in boxes, setting up, etc. For this reason of no set up time included, I do not think I will be having another party there. I really hope the owner considers adding in free set up time. I have heard in the mom's Facebook groups that many are deciding against having their party there because they think that is unfair.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tyocea Oneal\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I recently had a birthday party for my son at bravery I will say as far as in free play and a great place for little people to go it's amazing however the price for the birthday parties and the time slots allotted are ridiculous 300 almost $400 for 2 hour is ridiculous not to mention if you want extra time it's $80 extra even though she offered to give me 30 minutes for 50 dollars extra it was still too much for only 2 hours and the 2 hours included set up and breakdown so ask my guess for showing up I had to set up and if I wanted 15 minutes before to set up I had to pay an additional fee for that as well if you just want your kids to go and play it's cool it's an awesome place but I would never have a birthday party there ever again it is entirely too expensive and not worth it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaclyn Payne\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 year old had a great time.

It was hard finding a safe space for my sister and I am beyond blessed to have found this place. 🤗 💕\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brenda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very nice space with lots of options for the kids to play safely.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We really enjoyed it, great for our 3 year old\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Holthusen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: $15 for unlimited play. Military discount available. Lots of fun stuff for the kids to do. Multiple different types of rooms. A great place to bring a shy kid to build their courage.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Octavia Brown\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This is hands-down, the best place to take your kids. The staff is absolutely amazing. I had both of my kids birthdays there and the staff was so helpful with everything. They made the experience so stressless for me. If you have kids under 10 this is the place to be.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicholas Owens\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Amazing kids play area!

I definitely recommend frequent cleaning throughout the day because the playing space gets dirty even though we’re not allowed to wear the shoes inside.\nI’ll continue to take my son there and hope to see some updates 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Wendy A\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: I have been going for about 3 years and never a disappointment.

The kids (all aged 1-8) really enjoyed themselves and the party room was the perfect size. I didn’t get names, but the woman and man that worked this morning were so kind and accommodating. Whoever I spoke to on the phone to originally reserve was very kind and professional as well.

The lady at the desk had a nasty attitude from the time we walked in, till the time we left. The foam ball pit had other people's hair stuck on it.

They advertise saying that kids 12 months or younger is free (even says it on the board inside) with a older sibling but the woman at the counter says that it's 11 months not 12. So false advertisement!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elvira Pacheco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My son who is now 5 has been coming here since he was 6 months old.  Not only is the owner and amazing influence and wonderful with children , the staff is always vigilant and professional.   Your littles will not want to leave when it’s time to go so prepare for a fit when it’s time to go.  The prices for snacks and play is very reasonable.   They do celebrate holidays and do pics with Santa as well as story time, summer camp, Hola Friends, activities and so much more. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone that needs a break to lounge while their children play.  You can see your children play while sitting down and relaxing.  Worth a visit !!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Richard Sigouin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My grandson loves going to Bravery Gym and we like taking him there because it's easy to supervise and watch without having to chase him through a large building.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ze'ev Beleck\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: Found this place by accident on our away back from Florida. Looked online for a place the kids could enjoy, and found the perfect location! The staff is friendly and welcoming, and the activities are wonderful for children! There's a sensory room, a quiet reading room, a dance pad, jungle gym, and more.\nWill be back on our next vacation!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marsha Carson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Looks as if it’s filled with hand me down toys and a bit run down. Most definitely for children 5 and under in my opinion. Happy hour is $6 and you can’t beat that if your looking for something to do. Wish it had massage chairs for parents and more of a snack and drink selection. There’s definitely potential.\n\nMusic should be for children and not love songs\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Lespreance\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My family LOVES this place!! My son is 3 and has sensory issues with his feet and my daughter is 1 with very little socialization outside of my house.

If you’ve got little ones under 6 with too much energy, this place is great for them to socialize and play their hearts out.

So much to do and play with! $12 a child for all day, you can leave and come back. The lady behind the desk went out of her way to make sure a child was okay when he fell. Has a calming sensory room and clean bathrooms. I will definitely be going back again and again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jay Carter\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: The price combined with all the restrictions and employee attitudes is ridiculous. My niece’s party was this past Sunday 03/06/2022, my sister in law and a friend did a combined party. This was both of their daughter’s first birthday. They originally booked the space for 2 hours from 11:30 - 1:30pm. My sister-in-law was told that the set up and clean up time were included in the 2 hour booking time. The two hour time slot before theirs was not booked, despite this an additional 30 minutes was booked for $50 to ensure there was enough time to set up. Even though she paid for the additional 30 minutes she was unable to bring more than two people with her to set up because they did not want the equipment used. Why did that matter if she paid for the time slot. My sister-in-law got to the place at 10:30 to try to blow up some of the balloons in her car. An employee then came out to the parking lot informing my sister-in-law that she was not able to enter the building until 11 am even though no one else had rented the area before her. The employee explained this by stating that she was sweeping the area. My sister-in-law saw her grab a broom and pretend to sweep for 30 minutes. Overall, the party costed around $400 for 2 and 1/2 hours. 30 of those minutes were used to decorate the area. While the party was fairly enjoyable the stress of the strict time limits made it difficult for my sister-in-law to fully enjoy the party. I understand that the parties are booked for a specific amount of time for a reason. What I don’t understand is why an additional $50 had to be paid for 30 minutes when there was no party booked in the slot before. If you pay for the time I also don’t understand why there is a limitation on the amount of people you can bring with you. Overall, this place is way overpriced for all of the rules and restrictions that were given to my sister-in-law. We will never book this space again for any reason. Overpriced and underwhelming with rude employees.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Genice Richardson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Great place. My toddler loved it.

There are a lot of things for the kids to do there.  Jungle gym, swing, sensory room, and movie room.  It is a woman/veteran owned business.  This facility has two uses. The first is drop in childcare and you can also bring your child to play as you sit and watch.\n\nThe staff are super friendly, and the whole place is clean.\n\nMy son was there once with no other children and Mrs Marcella did science experiments with him and kept him busy the whole time.\n\nThe only bad thing about this place is there are no other locations.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelia Wilkins\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: Thank you for your review!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lakeshea Holmes\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: Thank you for your review!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alyssa Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: This place is amazing, my kids adore it.

Great place for toddlers\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Tryme\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: I honestly think for Toddlers, this place maybe a little bit better suited for them than Chuck-e-Cheese. Little ones have a ton of space to move around and play.  I spent almost two hours in this gym, and my daughter had to be convinced she was tired and hungry in order to leave. Long story short, I was the one burned out lol. But She slept liked a log when it was time for bed time.I highly recommend this place for little ones to get exercise and play, especially on a rainy day.  Plus they get to interact with other children, which is a good thing for children who are the only child. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Wells\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: Me and my daughter love this place! She has so much fun here.

Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny..

It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue \"Elsa\" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlyn Brown\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We had so much fun!

Very reasonably priced especially for a membership which we definitely get our use out of. Perfect for rainy days or to take a break from the summer heat! The play environment is always clean, well thought out, and inviting. The owners are so kind & plan fun events like story time/crafts and pizza play nights. I love how there are tables to sit and eat a snack or watch children play. Perfect place to meet up for a play date. 10/10 would recommend😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janelle James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My family had the best experience at this indoor play place. The owners were so friendly and down to earth. They are great people and very personable. The environment is targeted to younger kiddos. Our three and six year old kiddos had a blast. They played non stop the full two hour session. We were just stopping in the area for a short while during our travels but if we lived here then we would definitely get a membership here. Thank you so much little bee indoor playground! We had a fantastic time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: H T\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This playroom was perfect for my 2 year old! He spent the full 2 hours playing & having so much fun. The room is very clean & had many toys for all ages!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Ellwood\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son (newly 1 year old) had a BLAST at little bee! It was very sensory friendly and so many different areas/things to play with. The snack bar has a great selection and even a free coffee bar for the parents.\nThe lobby/lounge area is the perfect place for mom friends to meet up! You can tell much thought was put into this process... from the nursing room, to having high chairs for the littles. THANK YOU for bringing something like this to New Bern!🥰\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baily Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A}",

The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Solberg\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old! My husband and I love it because we can sit and watch her without running all over the place. We also don’t have to worry about any injuries because everything is soft and padded. Definitely has become a regular spot for us :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Harris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Okay, I showed up skeptical not knowing what to expect and left with a monthly pass! My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

Safety concern there, but generally kids are smart enough to avoid it or just get bad vibes.\nOh and their arcade is whack, but you really ain't going there to play with the arcade so no deductions there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: If you’re curious about having a birthday party here, here are the things you need to know. It’s lengthy.. sorry 🙃\n\nTime: We had a birthday party for our son and let me tell you the time frame they give you for the room is NOT worth it. They don’t serve the pizza until after 30 minutes so you have 45 minutes to get through the pizza, sing hbday, do the cake, & presents, get every body out of the room and get everything packed up and get out of the room yourself. Play time is until they close so that’s beneficial but you did pay for everyone already so it’s actually expected.\n\nFood: pizza is from papa John’s and is very good!\n\nFees: if you get sick or have an emergency and need to reschedule, they fee you $50. Children get sick all the time so you would think they would be understanding being a kids place but they very much not understanding and do not care at all.\nThere is also a $75 fee if you go over the party room time for every 5 minutes over. We were all stressing trying to get through everything to be able to get out in time especially since they don’t let you in early to decorate or set up the food and cake, ect and don’t serve you immediately either so  you wait 30 minutes before you get the pizzas to eat so you really only have 45 minutes total for everything.\n\nThings included: they say decorations and plates and napkins are included. We received table clothes, a happy birthday sign, and only 10 plates and napkins. The juice boxes are the capri suns and they only give you 10. The reservation is for 10 kids and 15 adults so you’d think they’d give you more options or atleast waters for everyone. Good thing there’s a grocery store near by or the adults will starve and not have anything to drink or eat on because just like us, you will need it to go buy yourself more plates, napkins, cups & drinks.\n\nViruses/sicknesses: be prepared to get sick if coming. We managed to get the flu the week of our son’s birthday and had to reschedule. When we reached out to the owners to let them know we were all sick, the options the owners gave us were…\nOption 1: keep the date because they said “we’re going to lose your $300 this weekend if you don’t show up”  Yet, they knew we were all sick with the flu… and still wanted us to come in so they would “lose” out on our money.. I find it very irresponsible of these owners to sit there and say that to a parent.\nOption 2: pay additional fees ontop of our $300 we spent for 1 hour rental of a room. Which really is 45 minutes when you actually get to start eating.\n\nAs a parent, we obviously rescheduled and ate the cost because we in no way would want to get the other kids sick and we obviously didn’t feel well ourselves but to know the owners are willing to send people there knowingly with the flu not caring that it will get all the other kids sick is disgusting.  We usually come every month with friends and family but I think this will be our last time knowing now what we do. They’re so desperate for an extra $50 they lost a lot more from us in the long term.  We know kids get sick and we try to have fun and be safe but now knowing you’re intentionally letting people come in sick because you allow people to keep their reservations when they tell you they’re sick instead of simply rescheduling them to keep everyone safe without fees attached is bad business and it’s gross.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tina Remington\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Had my grandsons birthday there. They had 2 very young employees running the place.\nNOBODY helped us prepare anything in the party room. Nobody checked on us. We cleaned the room. Took 15 minutes to get a few slushies.

The kids love safari nation, and it's a very safe, clean play experience for them.\nThe birthday packages are very expensive and stressful though.  They don't allow you into your party room until 10 mins before the party, which makes it hard to set up, supervise and greet the guests as they arrive.\nThank goodness our pizza arrived on time (we've been to other parties where the pizza is very late), but it still left us rushing through pizza, birthday song, cake, and presents.  You must vacate the room at the end of your time or you will be charged an extra $75.  It was pretty stressful to get everything out in time and I couldn't help but think it stressed the kids too.\nAlso, they really need things for the adults to do!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zachary Whitaker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Farid HACHANI\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joanna Granado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Hosted my daughter’s birthday here on a weekday.

The date the pass is purchased the pass expires 30 days from that date whether it is used or not. My son’s Grandfather purchased a monthly pass for him and wasn’t told that the monthly pass had an expiration date on it before even being used one time. The pass was purchased on 3/30/24. I wasn’t able to take my son until 4/27/24, so my son lost 27 days from his birthday gift. The worker told me that my son’s pass would expire on 4/29/24 and if I wanted to purchase another month I could do so. So my son receives a monthly pass for a birthday present and he can only use it for 3 days now because we weren’t told it needed to be used immediately!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reg Rogers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for my eldest daughter to manage.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: TGLKRL\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Not a great place for toddlers because too many bigger kids are running wild and screaming.

The volcano makes so much LOUD, unnecessary noise and it goes off constantly so there is no rest from it while watching your kids play. Also the men’s restroom needed toilet paper while we were there. A friend ended up having to use paper towels to wipe with while there. Not pleasant! Other than these things, the kids had a blast so that’s a plus.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawn Carson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids love going here but this past time the so called adults were acting like children.

Well i guess they will feel better when their child is grown up and they are looking down a barrow of a gun because no one can tell there child anything. Dont get me wrong if it was done in a bad way i would have agreed with him but it wasnt.

We arrived right when they opened and little did we know that the place would soon be taken over by lots of older kids from the Y. All the commotion from all those kids did overwhelm my son at times, but we still managed to have fun. I appreciated how large their 4 and younger section was and there were 2 slide options. I wish there was staff regulating that area a little more as some of the older kids did attempt to play in the area. With the larger playground, there was a good variety of slides and activities. However, there are some areas that need to be fixed as you could see things were falling apart after lots of wear and tear. There is a section where you can shoot soft balls and my son was scared of that noise and it was going off often. I appreciated that you could bring outside food, but not sure why you cannot bring outside drinks. Overall, it can be a hit or miss on how busy it is so you just take that risk when you go. Also it truly depends on your child if they will like that type of environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tracy Freeman\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place was just \"NASTY\"...Trash in the floor,the tables had trash left on them, drink spilled on the tables ... Was there for over 2 hours never saw  anybody cleaning...The only cleaning done was by family members cleaning the party room after we were done..This place was ran by kids no adult management.....\"Very Over Priced\" for this kind of Environment... Would not recommend to anyone...\n\nNot enough time to have a half way  party ....the pizza's were late....The staff are just young kids running the place ...No kind of adult management...VERY OVER PRICED FOR THIS ENVIRONMENT!!!

They usually avoid opening the zip line. When they do, it seems like the employees are arguing over who's turn it is or isn't to operate it. There's one girl (I should have got her name - not the one always in the hat) that always goes above and beyond to be sweet to the kids when she operates the zipline. If the girl in the hat and the man are there, they don't bother opening it. Instead, they pretend to sweep at the start of every hour. If by the off chance they do open it, it's at 15-20 minutes after and keep it open for 10 or 15 minutes only.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha White\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Today was my sons 4th birthday party, and I will never use safari nation again. I called and asked about my reservation and they confirmed that they had the color green wrote down and that I could only have 10 minutes to decorate with my stuff. I also asked when they ordered their pizzas so I could make sure mine was ready at the same time. They told me they would be ready at 2:15, I got there and they literally made me wait till right at 10 minutes to get in the room (I saw other families that got in while the members were cleaning from prior parties) then i get in the room and they didn’t have any of the green things out. So the 10 minutes I did have pushed me further back, and had my guest watch me set everything up. I was given the room with no instructions. They didn’t give me the juice boxes till 20 minutes before my party was over and the pizza got there with 30 minutes left in the room. You only get one hour in the room. I’m thankful I had juice and pizza for the kids or we would have literally been sitting there till half way when the room time  was over. My child’s name wasn’t wrote on the door for my guests to even know where to go. There was signs on the table telling me to tip my party attended but I had no attended the whole time- I was even told that an attendant came with my package- I had no one helping the whole time. When I asked about it, they said I had to request one and that no one would really be in there much anyways. The staff were very rude and acted like we were a bother. When you spend almost 400 dollars, I expect so much more. I have had several parties at other facilities, and will definitely use those. It was embarrassing to me, and even some of the people at the party that are members of safari nation. We will not be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Butterfield\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Toni Whittaker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for a birthday!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Nice place.

The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old!

My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.\nThey have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Lafountain\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: While visiting from out of town we needed a place to play while it rained. Funky Frogs was the place that delivered. Would highly suggest to anyone looking for an indoor play place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley McKinney\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.  Always clean, always friendly, and always a ton to do.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cesar Hembree\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Great place for my 3 year old. Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Briana Willett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jevon Brun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My sons love Funky Frogz!

Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.\nThe space is clean and it’s got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.\nSo thankful we found this place.\nWe will be back 💙\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie marie\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

Was looking for something indoors to do since it was so hot today. They both had so much fun and did not want to leave. Their favorite thing was the dinosaur room and the playground. Atmosphere was relaxing was not crowded today. I like that i can bring my own food for them they do have a cafe there as well. 10/10 recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica McLeod\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hands down the best spot for indoor play that I have been to for my 2 year old and 6 year old.

Do you have babies and/or toddlers and need somewhere indoors, out of the elements for them to play? And you’d love to sit and drink coffee while they play? This is place for you! You can get snacks here or you can bring your own as long as they are no nut products. The bathrooms even have diapers and a Change of clothes if needed! We’re so excited about it. You sign your waiver, take off your shoes, and play. Adding it to my schedule of events for the month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Tolliver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super fun! Great relaxing place to let your kid(s) run around without having to tell them no every 5 min. It’s a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.\n\nSaturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.\n\nI wish there were more gates around doors here though, I’ve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darien Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebastian M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners, the play sets, the crowd, the snack options are really nice and all for a reasonable price.\nI will definitley recomend and come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morar Daniela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Lovely, amazing, super clean place with helpful staff and reasonable prices.\nI’ll be looking to get some sort of membership, my 4yo loves it! 🩵🩵🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impressions are that this place is good fun for the littles.

As well as seeing and watching other kids doing what they were doing too.\n\nWe might be visiting more often :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicki Kennington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was my first time visiting here. I love the variety of toys and playhouses they have. My 11 mo granddaughter had a great time playing and exploring. I will definitely bring her back.\nMy only criticism is that the music is a bit louder than it needs to be. The volume mixed with kids playing and yelling is a bit much. Also, maybe play children’s songs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jinnow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Ryan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Delmazeo Sanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ari S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place for my toddler! Hands down the best find we have found for him to come play at. We make a 45 mins drive to come here because of how great it is. Staff is very nice, place is kept clean and organized. Other kids and parents have always been polite too and the play areas have stuff for all different ages to enjoy including for the parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liana Regan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son (3.5) has a blast here!   They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place! Happened upon it on a rainy day and it's perfect for my 1 year old!  Thanks to the Floridan family for making sanford your home! We will be back!!\n\nWe come here primarily because it is a Christian-based, young child friendly space with relaxed atmosphere. We appreciate this safe-space for our family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Claus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I come here with my kids all the time. It's big and has plenty of stuff for kids to do, and situated between a coffee place and food store - so it's easy to grab a snack or drink!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Cameron (Kim)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My child loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Beam\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.\n\nWe arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it!

Nice relaxing environment. I love that there is a separate little dining area. We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business.

The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

The drinks…as always were amazing. But I can not brag enough about the staff and how thoughtful and considerate they were throughout the entire party.

It’s great to have your kid run around while you enjoy their delicious coffee. They also offer great panini sandwiches that my daughter loves. It doesn’t get overwhelming but your kid gets everything of each - exercise, sensory and social skills. They do storytelling and other activities as well that are super fun. We’re also planning to rent them for bday parties in future :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Team Riano\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This place and the owner and  staff are amazing!\n\nBeautiful venue with great play areas for babies and toddlers.

My son just turned 3 and it was the most stress free party we’ve had. The venue is set up in such a way that kids are supervised no matter where you are, so you can actually talk to other adults while the kids play freely. I was able to drop stuff off ahead of time and they set it up for us! And then they do the clean up after 🤯 truly, stress free and my son had the best day. He woke up the next day and went straight to his closet to get dressed and said he wanted to go back with all his friends and do it again 🥹 Thank you Funtown Cafe!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K Henry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We had so much fun visiting Funtown Play Cafe!

Kate was extremely communicative and available from the moment we booked the party. We purchased the ultimate package so they set up all the decor, tables, food, etc…based on what theme and colors I requested and it looked absolutely a perfect and exactly what I wanted! The kids had an amazing time and the parents loved it as well because they could enjoy beverages and food while watching their little ones play. Overall it was a fabulous party and wonderful experience. I didn’t feel stressed at all knowing that Kate was taking care of all of the preparations and food and was able to enjoy the party as well. Would absolutely have another party here in the future!!

The muffin tins are GENIUS! my kids absolutely loved being able to choose exactly what they wanted so nothing went to waste. I can't wait to try more paninis, but I really enjoyed the Caprese one and appreciated the mixed green salad it came with.  The play area was very clean and not too wild and over stimulating. We went during their busiest time of the week but it wasn't too wild at all.  Perfect place for parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Anderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a blast at Funtown play cafe today!

This is perfect for kiddos 2-5 and while they play you can get a coffee, chai latte, or other drink of your choice. The boys loved the snack trays (seriously, so creative how they serve these!) and we will definitely be back! If you can time your visit to lunch/after lunch, you will likely have a smaller crowd.}",

The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting — sewer water was overflowing and actually leaking into the play area, which is a major health concern. Had we not already paid to play, I would have walked out. The entire facility felt unclean and poorly maintained. I paid $24 expecting a fun, safe environment for my kids, but it felt like a complete waste of money. We left within 20 minutes of our play time and we won’t be coming back. Megaplay seriously needs to address these issues.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Richard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: At 12:15 we are told that we can't enter with our 3 year old because \"the current playtime is about to end and the next one doesn't start until 12:45\". There ONE child currently in there playing. ONE! There are two parents with him. So, there are literally twice as many parents, including the staff, three times as many adults as children here. Still, our child can't come in, and we can't wait inside either for some odd reason. \"You have to come back at 12:45\" we are told. I point out the ONE child thing. Nope, come back at 12:45. I'm informed these rules \"are strictly enforced and have been since covid\". So, I asked \"why have we not been turned away and told to come back at a designated time the last THREE times are three year old randomly decided she wanted to go there\"? With a straight face, the girl behind the counter tells me, \"well, it depends on who the staff members are that are that are working that day as to if the 'rules are enforced'\". Have you ever tried to explain to a three year old, who's now throwing a fit because she can't play, that she has to go somewhere else and can't play because the wrong staff member is working that day? One last try. \"Ma'am, there's one other kid in here, she's all excited to play, no one has ever mentioned this to us before\".  Nope, come back at 12:45. ONE kid! I have no problems with there being rules. I do have a problem that only ONE staff member chooses to enforce them or even make them known. I do have a problem that we were allowed to pay and play three previous times and out of the 5 maybe 6 other staff members we've met, none of them ever mentioned these \"strictly enforced\" rules.\nTLDR;\n1)Whether or not your child can play without an appointment in a building with ONE other child, COMPLETELY depends on which staff members are working that day.\n2)We did NOT return at 12:45\n3)You are not allowed to use the restroom to change a toddlers diaper unless you pay. You can't pay until 12:45.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Craig Vincent\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It's a fun enough place for what it is.\n\nGreat way to spend 90mins and let your kids tire themselves out while having fun.\n\nThe kids play area is engaging for toddlers and there are two pretty cool bounce houses\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It was pretty cheap, nice to play to go on a rainy day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey Vincent\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This was B U L L S H I T\nBULLSHIT.

I booked the party room for my daughter’s birthday party and when we arrived…. It was a TOTALLY different theme. All of the guests were in mini mouse attire and the room was decorated with Moana. I was so embarrassed. The staff went to the back and found 1 pack of mini mouse plates and 2 pack of napkins and offered to “decorate” with those items. They offered to refund me the $30 for decorations and a refund for the 3 EXTRA PIZZAS(that i did not order) to my reservation. Nothing could replace the special day that we were all looking forward to. Also the employees rushed us out of the party room smh.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hello Shneighther\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My baby sister turned 4 today and we decided to take her to play.  she's afraid of the high slides so she wanted to stay and play where the 3 year old play one of the works came up to us and told us that the manager Katy told us she couldn't play there and that if we didn't leave she would call the cops on us. I thought it was very disrespectful and stupid how she said she would call the cops on us because our kid didn't want to play in the big slides.

I took my daughter to megaplay early January around 11:30  when I was told from an employee to come back\nIn 15 minutes as there where three parties going on. My daughter and I then proceeded to wait the 15 minutes which it is now 11:45, come back as to where I was greeted by another employee who stated they have reached the maximum capacity and I could not check my daughter in to play until 5pm at night which was an enormous inconvenience for myself and my 5 year old daughter who was in tears leaving as I had to explain to her that she could not play. I cannot understand how this kind of business can accept employees that toy with children’s emotions like that. And I will post this review on every social media platform so they know the kind of standard that is being held at the Megaplay Jacksonville, North Carolina location. What a disgrace. Zero stars if I could.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Lawrence\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: 3 stars due to cost and needed maintenance and upkeep.\n\nMy daughter (3 years old) absolutely loves Megaplay. She has more fun here than she does at Zing Zumm and Altitute, both of which we have memberships for.\n\nThat said, I think Megaplay is prohibitively expensive as a place to take my daughter. Zing is $100 for an entire year, and for her and I to jump at Altitude 7 days a week for 2 hours at a time it's $40 a month. At Mega, there is no monthly option, so taking her just 3 times a month is as expensive as Altitude unlimited visits.\n\nCan we get a membership option like everywhere else?\n\nAs for maintenance, the junglejims have many spots missing padding, covered in duct tape, equipment removed likely due to damage. The bounce houses have airleaks and tape all over.\n\nI'm not posting this to bash, we really love it and would really love if we could go more often and see some much needed repairs. Thank you and please think about it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Eric Smith\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Well after booking we didn't get to go because it was closed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lakysha Neal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I bring my girls every weekend and they love it and have so much fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: megan bryan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Came for a birthday party and it was a fun clean environment.

I took my kids here because it’s always a great time and my youngest is almost 3 years old. He was in the big jungle gym and I was with him. Well another kid bulldozed into him (not so mad about that bc kids will be kids) what I was and am furious about is the fact that he almost fell from almost the ceiling height to the ground level on the ground. If I wasn’t there he would’ve 100% fell to the ground from up there.\nPictured below is the netting he was gripping onto before the incident happened. When he fell from another kid running into him he was completely under the netting except for his head, I pulled him up immediately and I checked to see if I was being dramatic or not and I was in fact not being dramatic. The net was completely open and any child would have fallen to the ground especially smaller children. This is not safe and should be better handled. Fix this so it doesn’t happen again or worse.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evangeline Jones\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: On 11/15/2024 at approximately 10:02AM My son & I visited Mega play's Center. I am writing this review to raise awareness about discrimination faced by children with developmental delays during playtime. Office Manager of Megaplay left her office door open leaving a safety hazard to all children in this establishment my son entered her office to play on her play rug and we were verbally attacked by this Manager screaming for us to \"get out of her office\". I immediately attempted to explain my son is Autistic and this door should be closed. We were kicked out and I asked for a refund before I would leave. The Manager did grant this refund while speaking in a tone and demeanor not professional or fit for any type of leadership. As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which ensures disabled children have equal access to play and recreational activities my sons experience suggests that such principles were not upheld.  On behalf of my son, I would like to emphasize the need for this environment to become more nurturing and increase the ability for children to be able to thrive here. I am disappointed in my experience both women in this business lacked professionalism. maturity, and the ability to run an establishment properly by using conflict resolution this is a vulnerable child. You kicked him out because he entered your office and then screamed at a parent? I'm mortified...I ask anyone in this community don't allow your children to be treated like this. This business is unsafe, and follow-up will be taken to determine ratio per employees, cleanliness, and overall ability to operate properly. Staff training and creating a more inclusive environment should be required for this establishment to continue to operate.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Ferguson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The set play times make no sense since it is never busy. You cant get your full hour and a half unless you get there at the right time. It’s way too expensive to not get the full time. Also had an older sibling go into the toddler area to help my toddler get off something and she was told to get out she wasn't playing in the area just helping her sibling quickly so i don't understand that either. They’re loosing money with the set play times I saw plenty of people come in and then leave because they’re told the next play time starts in 45 minutes or whatever. Dont waste your money just go to altitude\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Tinsley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: 2 stars.

I am someone who really struggle with perfectionism and people pleasing. Thanks to this, party planning means a lot of stress for me. The folks at Megaplay were so kind and accommodating from the first moment I called. They had no problem answering every question I had before booking the room. They also explained clearly the fees and accommodations. In addition, they never made me feel uncomfortable or like an inconvenience for needing more clarification or for asking a second or third time. They also confirmed my time slot and accommodations twice before the date of the party. They made it clear they would do all the decorating all I had to do was drop off my supplies, and there was even an option to have them go buy the supplies for you (for an additional charge.)\n\nAll of that is great alone, but the staff really went above and beyond to support me. My daughter woke up sick the day of her party and I frantically called crying and defeated that everything was ruined. Not only did Megaplay have no problem rescheduling me, but the staff went out of there way to offer me reassurance and support that everything would be okay. Not as a customer, but as a stressed out mom thinking way too hard about a pokemon party. The reschedule affected the guest turnout pretty badly and I was fretting around in circles most of the party. Josh and Joyanna were right there for me the entire time. They checked with me every few minutes to make sure I was doing okay. They let me take the reins wherever I felt comfortable, but had no probably helping me direct the flow of the party in my stressed out state. I cannot count the number of times they told me “if you need anything at all please don’t hesitate to let us know.”\n\nThe sincerity of the staff at Megaplay made every difference in the world for me. Thank you so much to Josh and Joyanna for having next level customer support. It was so clear my experience mattered to them as a person not just a customer. They were really able to help turn my entire mood about the party around.

As we were sitting and watching our children play, we seen the staff standing on tables to decorate for the party the next day, never cleaned the table off, wearing dirty shoes where families place their food at for their parties. When we had the teenagers helping the toddlers in the toddle area, the workers played the voice over saying they weren’t allowed to be in there, yet no one was in the building other than us & we were sitting next to them… but instead of being nice & polite they rudely continued to play the sound seeing that the teenagers were just helping.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this place. It was my first time there and I would never bring my family back or myself. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Taillon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Shepard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicola Gerber\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: They offer a military discount which is appreciated. But you have to come during the certain play times, so prepare. Then we asked to use the bumper cars and were informed since it is within 30 minutes of ending playtime it is closed. It would have been nice to know about it closing when we came in.\nThe large obstacle blow up had a hole where my 10 year old son's leg fell in, we reported it. It could be very dangerous for a small child who could fall all the way in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Bowling\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This is always so fun for the kids to play, and the prices are incredible!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Birgit Fuller\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Took grandkids but had to leave a after about 1 hr since it was uncomfortably warm inside the building and with all the kids running and playing it made it uncomfortable to say the least\nSomewhat dissapointed\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Riley Wagner\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place DESPERATELY needs a revamp.\nHere now with my kiddos and all the bounce houses go straight to the floor when you step in!

They decided to turn off the inflatable with my son in it even though they knew he was in there, and even saw us standing at the end of it trying to get him to come out of it. I reached out and asked for management but never heard back. Then my son asked to go again on his birthday on the 20th and we took him. We were super surprised to find that it was absolutely disgusting on the inside. All the inflatables hardly held my 29lb daughter and were all taped but still leaking air. The bridge at the top of the play place had a screw that was barely holding on and was bent. Then when I went to the front desk to buy drinks for my kids I could not find the lady that was up there till my fiancé pointed out that you could see the top of her head as she was sitting down below the counter on her phone. I tried getting her attention said hello and excuse me, but it wasn’t till the phone rang that she got up a couple minutes later. It really does suck because my kids love it here but now we gotta find a new place to take them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Wangard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Not worth the money in my opinion.

During covid, they were on top of keeping it pretty clean. They stopped play time every hour to walk through and sanitize.  The equipment has always been a bit worn out, but this last visit, I was blown away. They have let this place go all the way downhill. 2 days after visiting this place, my son came down with a high-grade fever.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the only thing I noticed was how HOT and muggy it was inside. Smelled like moldy gym socks. My son was too excited to turn back, so we continued.  My son is only 40 pounds, and he was the only child in the whole building. The bounce house he first picked could barely stay inflated with just him on it. Lots of holes and tape to patch these inflatables up.  And dirt. Lots and lots of dirt.\n\nIn the jungle gym maze part, there is pure filth. Candy wrappers, dirt,  drippings of God know what, and HAIR EVERYWHERE.  Lots of spots in the maze need to be fixed properly before someone gets seriously hurt. DUCT TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING.  Mind you, we were the first ones there for the day.  So surely there were plenty of hours to clean before the next batch of children came in. There are signs all over saying, \" If your child shows any sign of being sick, please inform the staff immediately.\"  Well, it's 2 days later, my son is very sick, and the only place we were was mega play.\n\nI understand that businesses are short staffed, and I will say that the only girl working in there was very kind..... but this filth is absolutely unacceptable at a childs play place.  They charge 12 dollars for one hour. Not worth it at all. I will never ever bring my son back to mega play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jeffrey andre\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Papas play ground\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Seth Lauzon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Granddaughter had an absolute blast playing on everything.

And well worth all of the money spent.\n\nThis place was wonderful for our son’s 5th birthday party. Our son got to experience another kid’s birthday party held here last year and loved it so much, he asked to come back and have his birthday here this time.\n\nJust like last time, the tables were already set up, the room was already prepared for all of the parents and the kids. Literally all we had to do was bring our son and his birthday cake (with utensils).\n\nIf I could change anything at all, I’d want:\n-Help facilitating the pizza-cake-opening presents thing for parents/people who haven’t hosted a party before. Or a reference source offered at the time of the party.\n-Designated birthday seat for the birthday kid at the furthest end of the table.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Helen Guy\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It was horrible.bought token just to find out All the games were out of order.nothimg for the 3 or 1 year old to do.This place is a r ipe off\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya Juarbe\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Mega disappointment\n\nI've been bringing my family and friends to this establishment for a while now, so it’s disappointing to see that little to no repairs or maintenance is ever done whenever we revisit.  It’s very frustrating to see all the out-of-order signs and dirty mats my children are provided to play on. This visit was the most disappointing due to my son's favorite ride being out of order once again on our latest visit. I would assume with the price of entry; it should be sufficient enough for maintenance and replacements of mats and balls for the ball pit. As a frequent customer, I am pretty upset with the lack of care and upkeep of this indoor playground.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cadence Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: love this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juan Yanez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Horrible !!!

The price has doubled and the time slots are restraining. I can understand the timeslots of cleaning between but it doesnt seem like thats been happening. No one has been SANITIZING between guest visits. Vacuuming isnt sanitizing. At least spray some aresol lysol on some areas if there isnt time to wipe down. Also, there are 3 very large issues that need to be fixed on the equipment and if the managment just inspected it they would see how children could fall through or get hurt. I wont elaborate because id like them to look through all the obstacles and see what im talking about. Id be willing to change ny review if items were properly fixed. My kids havei a good time there but im tired of them gettinf injured there and sick after being there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carly Blackmar\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We use to love this place it was clean and well taken care of. Went back after a year and it’s dirty, run down. Kids still had fun but they were suppose to offer food popcorn or nachos the 2 kids they had running that shift had nothing on. The one bounce house was so low on air my 4 year old almost smacked the ground barely jumping. This place could be a gold mine with better equipment and more stuff. The games were too much money and a few didn’t even work. Definitely will go somewhere else next time it’s a shame.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexie Backer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 1 and 3 year olds LOVE this place!! So much fun and works out a lot of energy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Camryn Holloman\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have been coming to this place for 3 years and absolutely love it. Besides the occasional times my kids have gotten sick, never had many issues. I have my kids birthday parties here. My concern currently is yesterday when we went at the FIRST time slot available; my 5 year old managed to get their leg IN BETWEEN a zip tie that is holding the net to the giant Playset. Another parent had to run up there and help me break the zip tie as my child was suspended in the air.\n\nAdditionally, there was a large hole above the slide that my child thought was funny to try to stick their head through. Obviously I corrected my child. However, this is still a serious safety concern and should be checked CONSTANTLY and addressed asap. Not once a week!\n\nI called the manager the next day who told me once a week someone comes through to check the safety of the net and the playset. She Then proceeded to tell me that the large hole in the net above the slides must’ve occurred the same day because the employees check the nets every night. That is not possible, because we arrived at the very first timeslot that was available that day.\n\nI tried to explain to her that the zip tie was also loose because there’s no possible way my child could have slipped their entire leg through a zip tie in between the foam padding on the side; She continued to say it must’ve happened that day and that the employees are very busy.\n\nMy child is not a small kid. The zip tie had to have been loose. A zip tie that is loose connected to the foam siding can cause a child to slip through the side off the playset, and the only thing holding a child from falling down is that cheap net that the employees supposedly check every night? I think not.\n\nAdditionally, we have a birthday party planned there and I cannot get any refund for the party. I will lose 50% of the funds that I paid so I will continue to have my birthday party there for my child and we just have to ensure that a parent is in there with kids, because the employees do not effectively check the netting for safety. Most of the employees that work there are likely high school or early college kids who genuinely don’t care. It’s just a job to them. Nothing wrong with them personally I was at age once with a job that wasn’t a serious career for me so they genuinely do not care and probably do not check the netting every single night.They are NEVER been too busy the 20 times we’ve been here to check for safety hazards.\n\nMy kids enjoy this place so much so we will likely still attend here and have the birthday party where I can’t get my money back but if you’re a parent you need to make sure you watch your child extreme amount on that place and be up there with them or have an older child who is capable of watching younger kids because your childs safety is at risk on that play set.  And because you sign a waiver, the facility and the employees and manager genuinely don’t appear to care.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Robinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son loves this place!

It’s disgusting inside & needs better cleaning. This place is visually dirty. This place is also known that if you want your kid to get sick, you should come here cause it’s gonna happen.  You can read tons of reviews stating the same thing but the owner still does nothing about it. They also ironically only respond to some of the reviews, but none of the ones stating the issues with the place. If they don’t fix something soon, they’re gonna go out of business. My kids truly enjoyed this place and now we don’t go anymore cause we’re tired of getting sick & tired of the cleanliness so we wish it wasn’t run so poorly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leeza Cruze\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute place.

It took me a little to even think of where they could’ve gotten it from and this is the only place we went that’s remotely a possibility. Scrolling the reviews just now I see another one from 8 months ago where her child also got HFM after going there.\n\nI even wiped my kids hands and faces with wet ones wipes multiple times while we were there. The place isn’t clean or disinfected clearly. There were only a total of 5 other children in there while we were and it’s not like a daycare where you have no choice but to bring your kids there and they’re busy taking care of your children the whole time and may miss cleaning something. The employees could be sanitizing things during the loads of downtime they have.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D.N D.N\nRating: 2/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: During the pandemic I caught covid here.

A random child ran in the room and dug his hands in the birthday cake. Nothing was done or said. We were so rushed the entire time, then the best part. My mother was actually kicked out for \"complaining too loudly\" to the 16 year old manager. She then proceeded to kick out my crying 11 year old daughter on her birthday. This place needs to be shut down.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maxwell Matos\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: A little fun place for the kids. Adults are free which is nice.

For the price you pay for a Birthday Party ( $300.00 ). I have attended my granddaughter’s and a friend”s little girl’s party. And for what price is charged for an hour and a half for the service you receive is absolutely ridiculous. So if you like being rushed this is the perfect place.

Rude and unprofessional.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: michelle bates\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place used to be clean and fun for the kids.

I love that it gives him the opportunity to play, run out energy and socialize, but I do think the play areas could be cleaner. The foam mats are visibly dirty. There is also a play area specifically for younger children (less than 3 years old) and there’s often older children playing rough in that area. While I was there with my almost 2 year old, there were older kids jumping off of the top of the slide while my son was standing at the bottom of it and almost jumped right on him. I love that this is a cheap option to let your kids play, but I wish the rules were enforced more and there was more active supervision between staff and parents.}",

I took my 1.5 year old today for the first time. Daycare was closed this week due to the holidays, so this was a wonderful opportunity to burn some energy. $15 for two hours that we reserved in advance was well worth the price. We will be returning regularly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JP Pickens\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emma Hunt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My 16 month old had so much fun!

We were able to relax while supervising their play as the space was safe and well maintained. Highly recommend as two teachers of students with special needs! Many options for sensory play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lydia Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Taylor and Talia were great host for my son’s party, they made sure I had everything I needed.   Perfect party for 20 kids and their parents and grandparents, had no issues and had help with anything I asked.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shaynah De Lisle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Just had my daughter’s 4th bday at Sprouts and it was amazing! The staff was so accommodating and helpful that they made the whole process 100% better. Our out-of-town guests couldn’t stop praising how nice and clean everything was. All the kids had so much fun it was truly worth it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tristen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My 21 month old had so much fun here today! She was running around the full two hours!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baylee Farmer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I've taken my toddler here to play a handful of times, and I've always been so impressed with the cleanliness and the sweet staff members ready to help in whatever way they can. We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

This place is clean, and there are countless opportunities for kiddos here! If you need an indoor play area, this hits the spot!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raeford Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: If you're looking for an indoor birthday party venue, I definitely recommend Sprouts! We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff is very nice, layout is wonderful and super clean. Would recommend it to anyone. Thank you.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Yanez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Fun and safe atmosphere for kids!

Garriyn & Kailee were great offering help when needed. Even asked if we needed help cleaning up. Great clean facility with tons of room for littles to run & the party room has plenty of room for anything you would need.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patti Kuhlman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My grandson loves this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Weber\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We were visiting from out of town and looking for something to do with our 15 month old for a little time. We absolutely loved our visit to Sprouts! So much for kids to do and to do it safely. The staff was super friendly and welcoming & we loved every minute of our visit! We can’t wait to come back next time we are visiting the area.

The staff is friendly and helpful and the play area and birthday room were incredibly clean. The kids had so much fun and there was something for all - a great variety for our group of ages ranging from baby to 6 years old. It was nice to have the pizza and drinks included in the package so there was no worrying about that. I would recommend this to anyone with young kids! We’re already planning to come back during regular hours and meet up with friends so the kids can play even more!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lee Cuningham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My toddlers had a blast here this past week. Thank you for being open on a tough day after the holiday. Perfect setup for my 2 & 3 year olds as far as toys and sizes of toys. The check-in was easy and the employee was very nice and helpful throughout the 1 hour visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: romeo mullings\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Faith Peterson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was wonderful for a larger space to run and jump and climb on the rainy days! They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Eubanks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great space! Bright and clean with friendly staff. It's a great place for young kiddos that enjoy lots of sensory input.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ou wong\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robert Bright\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Safe environment for my 4 year old!

Reservation was super easy online and the staff was so helpful to ensure everything went smoothly. The extra hands with setup/cleanup was a godsend. Everyone had a blast and we are already planning  for another birthday in Sprouts next year!  HUGE SHOUT OUT to Jada and Garryin at Sprouts for making this birthday a fantastic experience for all!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kennie Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Amazing place. Full of sensory items, learning tools and safe equipment to burn energy and keep the mind stimulated. Loved the swinging apparatuses that even helped to calm my 3 and 5 year old admist all of the fun. Highly recommend and hope we get one in DFW!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Glynis Litwin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The playground is fun and the workers look like they enjoy their job. My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

I guarantee they will love it especially now because it’s so hot outside. Sprouts is a great alternative to a traditional playground and they accommodate all ages up to 6 years old. Go check them out they’re great!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Young\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jade M Pettit\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cute and low stress place to bring your kiddos!! They have a ton of different equipment for all ages and it's reasonably priced too! My 4 year old and 10 month old had a blast! Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

Talk about an amazing experience for a 5 year olds birthday party!! Everyone had so much fun, and the employees were SO attentive and even played with the kids throughout. I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back. I love that so much was included in the package, and am seriously considering a membership now that I’ve seen for myself how awesome this place is ☺️ if I could give 10 stars I would!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zariya Brevard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time here!

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place. They say ages 1-6 but I personally feel it's more geared to 2-4 year olds.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! Wonderful atmosphere and great sensory toys and activities for kids! The staff had amazing energy and did several organized dances for the kids (baby Shark, Gracie’s Corner) and played lots of great music for them!

The variety of Hands-On activities, problem solving creative thinking physical toys,  swings, tents even a zipline. opportunities abound for pretend and make believe;  a playhouse,  a kitchen, manipulatives galore.

I was introduced to this place through one of my child’s field trip and decided to take my family here only to be closely and physically monitored more than half the time. I do not have any autistic kids by the way. We had a male coworker literally standing close by my kids, even when I was supervising, fixing literally every single thing along as my kids were playing. It was super awkward and uncomfortable to have strangers that close up in you and your child’s personal space making you feel like you’re unwanted company. I could not enjoy my time with my kids when I was being watched within a few yards by total strangers or knowing they’re hawking my kids down. It’s super weird and it’s safe to say we won’t be coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Volentine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The staff at WRTS is incredible.

Easy to find, plenty of parking and lots of different activities for different age ranges and sensory types. Staff ratio to number of kids/ parents was good as well. Footprint is much smaller than Defy but adequate. Lots of fun and great alternative for families with smaller children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angela Sandoval\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We are visiting from Chicago and I needed something to occupy my two yr old for an afternoon. We came in around 1:30 and my son loved the play space immediately. We were the only ones there so got to know Heather who was working at the time. She is so sweet to chat with was gentle and patient with my son who eventually was playing with her and not me.. The play space has pretend play areas and more physical elements like rock climbing and a full sized trampoline. There’s something for every child here.  Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones trying to find a way to expend their energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David Brittain\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We hope you enjoyed your visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robert Thomson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Amazing play place for children!

Price to get in was reasonable but price of socks was a tad expensive when in a group of 3 or more but luckily we brought our own.\n\nPrice of food wasn't too bad, although the jacket potato was slightly cold, the chips were cold and wraps should come with chips which they don't. I was however impressed with the £2.75 slush which seemed very popular with kids. Not so much for a dairy free child to eat apart from chips or Crisps 🤔\n\nThe trampoline bit both the 9 and 4 Yr old loved and were all sweated out within the first 20 mins 🤣 the play area bit well that's a bit of a let down tbh. The under 4s area was overrun by kids older than 4! My 2 Yr old was pushed and there were babies in there that could only sit in the ball pit as it was just way too busy to sit anywhere else because older kids were just running wild. There wasn't enough seating in either areas of the upstairs cafe or the play area which was a tad letdown for me.\n\nAlso the lovely green button you press to get out the play area needs to be higher as my 4 Yr old was somehow found outside the play area with another family. You need a better booking in system for the play area as its a safeguarding issue if kids can freely get out. It seems peak times are just a free for all especially older kids.\n\nHaving said all that all the staff were polite, welcoming and helpful. The pizzas were good too. It would be nice to see staff in play area as well as parents of older kids keeping a close eye on them and to avoid the under 4 area.\n\nWould I return?? Yes because my kids loved it but were in no rush and that's why I've given it 3 stars. Would of gotten a 5 if more seating was provided.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Texas\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Floor in the seating area is dirty , empty packets and food left on floor staff behind counter appear to just sit chatting ay the till\n\nSteps up to the slide are dirty and crumbs , dirt and other debris appear to have built up on each step\n\nCleaning doesn't appear to be a priority\n\nShame because this place could be better\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathryn Halstead\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Nice place for a couple of hours fun for the kids. Normal foods and drinks are pretty reasonably priced…. Just beware of the slushy drinks prices……grandson went to get his self one. £4.95 ….

Can get some great deals to bounce and play but avoid weekends If you don’t like busyness. Really modern and fun playcentre, my 4 year old loves it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ewelina Modelska\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Avoid peak time. I was here on Friday noon. First we were met by a long queue outside. When we got inside after 15 minutes of waiting, the staff ensured that we would be able to stay an extra 10 minutes (I paid for 2 hours).It turned out that the room was overcrowded and there were no seats. I will only add that at the entrance I had to pay an extra pound as a fee for monitoring adult capacity. After half an hour of standing, we managed to sit down. Before I ordered the food, someone from the staff approached me, asking to leave the playground. When I asked why, he explained that I had a green armband and it was my time to leave. I explained that I was here only half an hour and I paid for two. It turned out that we were handed the wrong color of the bands.I didn't get an apology. He just threw me a different color of bands on the table. After less than two hours after entering, I was asked to leave the building again (the staff did not grant us the promised 10 extra minutes).I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. For that reason it's only one star- for tasty food.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sima shafiq\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Really helpful and welcoming staff and the kids loved it 😀 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathryn Martin\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: What an absolute con?! View availability on Groupon before booking so we know we can use the voucher, buy a voucher then the availability has all of a sudden changed. Not very good when the normal prices are so expensive. Very disappointing!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gazz Toole\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Not a bad place, but definitely let down by pricing and lack of parental supervision 5 kids.\n\nThe price per session definitely is an issue here, as a child just over 1 is the same as a child of 9/10, yet they can't use all the equipment due to their age. A staggered pricing structure would definitely make things better.\n\nAnother thing that lets this place down is the number of kids just being left unsupervised by parents, despite signs all over telling parents to supervise them. When you've got kids 7+ charging round the toddler area and throwing things at each other, it really doesn't feel like money well spent on a 1 year old to go in. During the quiet times it's not too bad, but when it's peak time, it'd be an idea for the owner/manager to have more staff in and actually enforce the rules\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pucks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen poole\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adam Leech\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: L.

Not safe at all if you have small children.  She didnt even ask people to make sure doors were shut never mind get off her stool to close them.  Too busy daydreaming.  The cafe staff were great though too.  Really hard working.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liliana Wawiorko\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: Very good place for kids}",

We purchased the \"Do It Together\" package. The wildflower theme was beautifully executed—the decor was stunning, and every little detail felt thoughtfully put together. The team did an incredible job preparing the space, making sure everything was perfect before we arrived.\n\nThe best part? They handled the main clean-up, all we had to do was take home what we brought, which allowed us to truly enjoy the day without the stress of packing up or dealing with a mess afterward. The kids had a blast, and so did the adults!

This is the first place who has actually sanitized between parties. I was so appreciative as we are very germ conscious. They also went above and beyond and had Frozen music playing for our party.

One of them even house sits & puppy sits for our family now. ALSO they have events all the time that are safe and so incredibly fun for the whole family. I spend every one of my off days here— the membership is more than worth it. 100000/10 the best place on earth to me! I really just can’t say enough good things about everything and everyone here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janique Liceaga\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best place to bring your kiddo. We have been here a few times and have plans to come back at least once a week (from several towns away). The facility is clean, the parents are attentive and the kids are kind. The staff is very cognizant of safety and I love their no nonsense approach to those trying to bend the rules that keep the little ones safe. Every time we have been we have see the staff cleaning multiple times during our session. Not only is it a great place to bring the littles but they have great lattes! 10/10!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cara Lowell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gunter Herd\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Good space, lots of variety and things to play with, very toddler friendly as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: gotay922\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Amazing place for toddlers, very clean and very attentive staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Page\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Fantastic place !

Large space so I’m sure even when it’s busy it’s not overwhelming. My nearly 2yr old had a blast in both the larger space and the small space designed for those under 2. Good options at the cafe, including tons of snacks for everyone. Staff very nice and cleaning up throughout my visit. Changing tables with covers and wipes, and a diaper pail in unisex bathrooms. Good pricing for unlimited play! Probably grabbing a membership because it’s the closest play cafe to us and our favorite so far! Want to shout them out to support a local business, but also don’t want anyone else to find out about this secret in Clayton. 😅\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachael Lucinski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 7 months ago\nReview: The cutest little play cafe!

It was nice to be able to grab a snack or coffee too!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reemareem Dickens\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a teacher of young children and a mother to 5-- Cubhouse  Play Cafe represents the quintessential place to visit for a momma of young children for the following reasons:  1.   It's super clean, 2. has friendly staff, 3.  great healthy snack choices and small meals for you and the kiddos and 4.  pretty good coffee (vanilla latte with oatmilk is great)  Sometimes you just want a place to sit and chat, drink coffee/tea AND be able to watch your children play in a safe and clean environment.  It's also full of things for kids to do.  They can read, slide, or pretend to be a cook in the kitchen!  There's lots to do.  They even have events. They once had a storyteller come to read a book for Earth Day.  She was so animated and the kids loved it.  The Cub House Play Cafe is a cross between an indoor playground, and a cozy coffee house. One of the best things is their very reasonable monthly membership rates.  (you can also pay as you play as well).  It's worth every single penny.  Your kids can make lasting, wonderful memories there. (You and your friends can as well!).  I HIGHLY recommend this place!!!  You'll thank yourself and your little ones will as well (maybe later in life :) ).......Your welcome.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linsey Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We LOVE cub house! We have a membership so that our daughter can come with us, her grandparents or whoever and it's the perfect stop to give your child the time to use their imagination and energy for good! The owners and staff are really helpful and kind! It's definitely worth your time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: W W\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Giving 2 stars because the coffee is good and the place is kept relatively clean. My 2 toddlers and I have been members at The Cub House Play Cafe for almost a year and im all about supporting local businesses but unfortunately we will not be coming back here. The owner is rude and lacks basic customer service and social skills. I wasn’t sure if it was just my family (we’re ethnic) but my friends that go there also said that the owner is not friendly and does not greet them or say hello. She scolded my friend for having her 3 year old in the 24 months or younger section, he was playing gently with his baby sister and there were no other babies in that play area. We go to many other indoor play spaces in the triangle and the owners/staff are very welcoming. Maybe the owner can take an interpersonal course to strengthen her business etiquette. FYI most of the bakery items at the cafe are from Walmart and resold at an overpriced rate.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sherry Rawlings\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great place to play when it's cold 🥶 outside. …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael Dardis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Great place for kids and infants.

It is the perfect indoor spot for my littles and myself! Coffee for me & snacks for my boys is a huge plus. The toys/ play area is always clean & the employees are constantly trying to keep it somewhat organized. They have fun events you can sign up and attend as well. I love the fact that you can reserve a time and they set a limit on how many families can be there. It keeps it from being overcrowded, which I appreciate!\nMy 3 year old boy loves it. My 4 year old (almost 5) does seem to get a little bored after a while but I think it’s his age.\nWe love the cub house and always enjoy our time there!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Caroline Childers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: What a gem of a place!

There wasn’t many kids and our daughter had a few of her friends not be able to attend, so we invited who was there to join in the festivities.

We went for a birthday party and all the kids had so much fun. There were stations throughout for the kids to play with. A dress up station, pretend play kitchen station, a tree filled books, balls, bikes, trucks, and more. There was an infant play and toddler play area. My toddler played with everything and did not want to go. The birthday room was separate for the party and then all the kids enjoyed the open play. I definitely recommend this place for littles.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatrice Paneto\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bryan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: The Cub House Play Cafe - A Wonderland for Kids and Parents Alike\n\nThe Cub House Play Cafe is nothing short of a magical kingdom where both children and parents can find joy and relaxation.

What brings the score down so heavily is the terrible hours. Bumble brews play cafe and little doodles have days they are open until 5 or 6pm. This place closes at 2. Im assuming as a convenience for the owner? So if your a working parent who doesnt work remote this wont work well for you. Also we have a membership. The main benefit is discounted play. Because this is tne only place like this in the area it fills up fast.which is wonderful for the owner im sure.So if you have no reservation and you come after 9. Your screwed. They also have no limit on playtime. Which sounds great until your waiting for people to leave just to get in. If theres no limits and people stay for 4 hours thats over half the time they are open. Moral is, its cute the drinks are yummy and kids love it. But if you have no reservation it extremely hard to get in once its abit after opening. I hope they become more convenient to families by staying open as late as the other places in the triangle do and my enforcing a time limit so that more people can enjoy the beautiful play place they have. 2/5\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marta Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This is a wonderful play space!

Definitely geared towards younger children (I'd say 5 & under). I loved that the owner was speaking to all the parents and asked us to please let her know if we have any comments or suggestions! We will definitely be back, especially when it's rainy or too hot to enjoy being outside this spring & summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiirini Hill\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love everything about this place so much to do and my son loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Snyder\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A great play space for young children! It is a really large venue with areas for the cafe, seating for parents, main play space for kids, a separate baby/infant space, and a party room.\n\nThe main play space has climbing toys, bouncing toys, building toys, a giant book nook, and many centers for creative and imaginative play. Almost everything is Montessori style which is really nice taking a break from all the noisy flashing toys out there.\n\nThe cafe is really nice, a good selection of coffee and tea but also a fridge stocked with other drinks. There are many different treats and snacks to choose from good for adults and kiddos.\n\nIt looks like a really fun venue for parties and will definitely be keeping this on my radar for the future.\n\nI think the price is reasonable for what you get, but I do think the membership or punch card is totally worth it. We spent 2 hours there on our first visit and would have stayed longer if we didn't have to go get lunch.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this place for parents with young kids - probably best for kids 5/6 and younger.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marta Tondera\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So glad to see a play cafe in the area.

The play space is bright, spacious, and caters to the toddler and preschool crowd perfectly! It’s divided into a couple separate areas if the kids want to roam and you can still keep your eyes on them. Even if you have kids under 2 or non walking children that may need a quieter space to play, it’s accommodating for all. I spoke with the owner and her family and she was super friendly as well as the other staff. Everything was super organized, clean, and welcoming. Definitely will be back!}",

We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i’m assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it’s too hot outside.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Micah Wolfe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We absolutely love this playground! Our kids loved it even more! (2 1/2 years old and 14 months old) They had a blast and did not want to leave! I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn’t even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend!

My friends girl and my girl were being scared by a little boy, we told them to ask him to stop. He didn’t listen so my friend and I asked him to stop and he still didn’t stop and then he started pushing and corning them with his arms on either side of them so they couldn’t get away! We told him that was not ok and then confronted his parents. He still pursued them and so we told his parents again. Now, non of this so far is the business fault but then the owner steps in while we were talking with his parents and says we should’ve come to her and not “ yelled at her customers, that this little boy comes all the time and is just fine.” My friend says” but he is pushing our girls” and the owner just argues back and it it obvious that she is upset and that this little boy is being backed up and will not stop. so we start to leave and the owner follows us out the door, still yelling, telling us not to come back. This is not the kind of place you want to bring your kids, if this is just one instance of how the owner of the business acts! That is not ok!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JENNIFER LIPSEY\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: Such a fun place. We  brought our boys here for an hour to burn off some energy!

Cruel EXCLUSION AGAINST ALLERGY kids. The way in which management speaks to allergy kids’ parents is inhumane and rude. Without mercy, the manager, Susan, disregards the safety of allergy kids. She doesn’t care about excluding kids at parties. Allergy kids need to exit the building to eat homemade food on the street or in the car with their parent. Alternatively, they can stay inside and watch their friends eat, while they sit there hungry with no food. Management doesn’t care about a parent’s concern. The answer will always be, “no exceptions, we’re a business! It’s a business rule.” I have never had a manager (stranger) be so cruel and abrupt that I burst into tears at defeat. I just wanted my child to be able to stay and eat with her friends at the party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Prathees Shan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alina B.\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Great place for kids for up to ~10yo or so.

The toddler section was the perfect set-up for him to move around and increase his mobility as he is just getting comfortable with walking and moving around. He also loved to ride in one of the cars on the track and going down the toddler slide. As were leaving, the manager on shift came to see how we enjoyed it and recommended Toddler Tuesdays.

Paid for 2 adults 1 child only $25 and we stayed for over an hour. (You could stay longer)\nThe play area is alot of fun for kids of all ages, they have a small climbing area for kids under 3. Giant fenced area with soft balls to play with. The main floor has small cars for kids to ride.  Claw games where every time is a winner so you kids can enjoy a nice little reward.\nIf interested there is food as well, pizza and other items.\n\nMy daughter is almost 3 and she had a blast and so did her dad and I winning her some prizes.\n\n100% worth it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: yesir\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hesam Bayrami\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole D\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I visited today, March 11th with my niece. Our last visit seemed okay, so we returned. She loved the bounce area. It is clean and has well-defined areas.\n\nI wouldn’t say the rules posted everywhere are monitored. I saw several kids get hurt by others climbing up slides and pushing down on the equipment. I get that parents and guardians are supposed to keep an eye on their child, but the fact is, that doesn’t always happen. They could use someone to walk the facility and remind the children of rules.\nAlso, everything seemed a “money-grab”. For example, I bought a water bottle for my niece and knew she wouldn’t drink it all, so I asked for a cup to share it between us, I was told it would cost an extra dollar. I ended up just buying a second water bottle that she took 2 sips from. I agree with another poster that the arcade games are unnecessary. They’re just another way to entice parents to spend more money.\n\nThe food was alright and fairly priced, but I intended to go home to eat between play times. After spending $20 ($16.99 + tax) for our entry fee, I thought it was with in/out privileges, but I was told if we go home to eat, we cannot return without paying again. When she said they didn’t have a way to track if I’d paid, I thought that’s untrue, as they ensure everyone in the facility signs a waiver. Or give me my receipt and I’ll prove I’ve paid when I return. Similar places in the area offer this and I’ll go there instead.\n\nOverall, I don’t think I’ll be back. Other patrons there were saying similar to me. It got very crowded and you could barely move sometimes. The staff were food police, coming up to parents and accusing them of bringing outside food.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Davies\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I took my grandkids today and was quite happy with this place.   Yes some of the food is overpriced but that is what it is everywhere.    Some of the food was reasonably priced as well.   They allowed to bring own water bottles in which is a bonus.   The kids had a blast playing on the equipment.   We chose not to do arcade games but nice touch that they are there.   Staff were very friendly, my granddaughter fell out front prior to going in and they let us in early to clean her up.   Definitely will return.  Can’t beat the price as we were there over 2 hrs and kids came home tired 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: VIVA LAVIDA\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Just had my daughter’s 4th birthday in one of their party rooms.\nThe playground is safe, clean and fun for kids of different ages and preferences.\nThe staff were very kind and helpful before and during our party.

Looking at the square footage, atleast a third of it is arcade toys.\n\nThis place is just such a money grab, at every turn, unnecessarily.\n\nThe slices of pizza are so small and prices inflated in a way that is so ridiculous I hate going here. No outside food allowed and when I went with my 6 month old and gave him and my toddler blueberries (in the shoe/coat area, not even in the gym itself)we got scolded/practically yelled at… it’s not like they have healthy options for food for a 6 month old and it was just blueberries. On that day it was 35+ degrees outside in the sun and we were told to go eat on the sidewalk or in the car.\n\nI always hear parents arguing with their kids that they don’t want to spend more money on the arcade toys/prizes etc. The Playcard eats at least half my money on my card every single time I’m there and it’s hard to avoid the games because they are everywhere.\n\nThe toys are actually pretty dirty, I have to bring alcohol spray with me and every time I wipe anything, filth comes on the wipe so I just keep my kids away from as many of the really dirty ones as possible.\n\nIf any other indoor playground opens, I will drop this place in a  heartbeat.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joy W\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Amazing place to take kids of all ages and keep them entertained for hours!

However, when I tried to use it recently, the card is not working anymore and the manager said it’s not their card. (Very very rude attitude !!)

When I arrived, the cashier was on the phone and didn’t bother to wait until she finished to check us in. Instead, she rudely rushed through the process, only telling me the fee and asking for the ages of my children.\n\nTo my shock, she then told me that strollers weren't allowed! What did she expect me to do—hold my baby for the entire time? When I mentioned I had to take the stroller inside, she suggested that I take out the car seat and put it on the table. I asked if she would be responsible if my daughter fell off the table, and she had the audacity to rudely tell me to “calm down.”\n\nThis is honestly the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I will not return and will be sure to share my experience with all my friends. It’s disappointing to see such a lack of concern for customers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alesia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Friendly/ helpful staff. Super clean and lots for both my 1 year old and 4 year old to do. They have a separate play area for toddlers to enjoy and one for the bigger children. Tons of arcade games for Littles and big kids too! They left happy and wanting to go back again!  We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: NS F\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: I would recommend considering alternative venues for your event. My experience with this establishment was disappointing, primarily due to the owner, Lisette, and her approach to customer service. I regret not reading   earlier negative reviews regarding her lack of professionalism and prioritization of profit over client satisfaction.\n\nDuring our event, I felt that many costs were unnecessarily inflated, which was particularly disheartening given the substantial amount we invested—around $800. This is a significant expense, and it would have been more enjoyable to spend that money on a nice dining experience. Additionally, Susan, Lisette's daughter, encouraged us to order more food than we needed, most of which went to waste.\n\nA particularly frustrating incident occurred when one of our guests was refused entry at the door, even though we had not yet reached the minimum capacity for our event. It was surprising to witness such a lack of flexibility. Our guest left the event upset .  I also noticed that a young family member, a 13-year-old, was allowed to work in the establishment, which I found unprofessional.\n\nFurthermore, the policy of not permitting outside snacks, while allowing drinks, seemed contradictory and not very customer-friendly. This restriction, which they claimed was for safety, appeared to be more about limiting customer choices. For those seeking healthier food options, the absence of such considerations was disappointing.\n\nI also felt pressured to purchase specific items such as cakes and decorations, which contributed to the overall sense of being taken advantage of as a customer. While Susan expressed a desire to apologize during the event, the timing felt inappropriate and did not mitigate the overall negative experience.\n\nThe  balloons we purchased  from them were not adequately inflated, leading to them not lasting the duration of our event.\n\nI believe in treating customers with respect and care, and I would encourage Lisette to adopt a more client-centric approach that values customer relationships over profit. I would strongly recommend exploring other venues where the owners prioritize treating their guests with kindness and respect instead of taking advantage of them .\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Armina&Arash Hoseinabadi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Simba Nala\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan G\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Not allergy friendly\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mikhail Osipyan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!!!🥳🥳🥳 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark U\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Booked a party here and they were super helpful before the party (answering questions, giving advice on the themes), and on the day the attendants were even more helpful and made everything go smoothly.\n\nFacilities were nice as there is a lot to do for the kids of all ages/personalities as well.\n\nWould book here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalina Lo Bianco\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Used to be a very clean place.

We decided today to go to kids cuckoos nest to get out and do something fun but avoid the outdoors on a super hot day due to me being 5 and a half months pregnant. We know from previous visits that weekends are normally busy so we figured later in the afternoon would be the best time. We arrived at 3:40 and upon entering we were met with the manager who informed us they closed at 4... The summer hours. When I stated that online it says 7, she became defensive. I pulled up googles page and showed her and she stated well its on our website. We left disappointed... After getting back into our car something told me to check their website and what does it say right there on their main page OPEN TILL 7 on Saturdays. I looked all over their facebook and website and never saw where it CLEARLY stated their summer hours.\nI highly recommend calling in advance to check their hours before driving out of your way to go like we did.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oleg Vasilkov\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: A really fun place to spend time with the child.

My son loves exploring everything there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: LaJoy Givens\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: I recently visited The Baby Bar for a private birthday and was a completely blown away by the details put into this establishment. I instantly felt the community centered intention behind this establishment. The facility is clean, safe, and well thought out with little people in mind to fully enjoy themselve. My baby girl had a blast and so did I watching her play. The owner was very kind, patient, and extremely welcoming to us all. I also thoroughly enjoy my iced latte from the bar and the menu selection provided to the adults. I especially like the ample amount of seating space for the adult to watch and/or relax while our little people played. I also loved the options available to families that serves a support, if needed such as drop-offs for affordable rates. This place was amazing and Im glad we had the opportunity to experience it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexis Rossy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I absolutely loved my experience at the Baby Bar with my little one. I feel like the owner thought of EVERYTHING down to the toddler-friendly menus and snacks available. The staff were so warm and welcoming and the check-in was quick and easy. I left feeling like “where has this place been all my life?” lol. It felt very clean, fun, and most importantly safe! It’s perfect for play dates, independent play, or even birthday parties! We cannot wait to return!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cassie Grimm\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Our 13-month old loved his time at The Baby Bar! There was so much for him to do, and he played so hard that he immediately fell asleep on the way home. Plus the coffee was delicious. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley H.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My son & I have visited The Baby Bar twice so far & have been satisfied across the board. The waiver system had issues our 1st visit but I understand that this is a small establishment & that hiccups will happen from time to time & that's ok! My son loves playing, I love the events & the environment, and the staff & owner are friendly & helpful. My family will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Deja D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: The Baby Bar was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. The location was amazing and the process was super smooth. The owner took my idea and ran with it when it came to the decor, and everything turned out even better than I imagined. My baby had the best birthday, and having it at The Baby Bar was definitely the right choice. Now all of my friends want to have their babies’ birthdays there, but we did it first 🤣😉 I cannot recommend The Baby Bar enough, whether it’s for parties or just everyday play. The owner truly understands the importance of play and supporting growing kids, which is something you don’t find everywhere. Every community needs a place like this!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alitza Marie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I have been visiting The Baby Bar for almost a year & it has been amazing watching it grow! My little one loves playing there & always looks forward to saying hi to Mya (the owner) whenever we go! They have hired more staff, have made some software improvements & upgraded some of the toys in the play area. There is also a baby gate separating the play area from the bar area so you don’t have to worry about the littles wandering back there. Huge shoutout to Paige for making one of the best espresso drinks for me today! She is very personable and helpful. We will continue supporting this business!! ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joe\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Although I am not the one to normally write a review, I feel compelled to share how disappointed I am with this business. From the top down, it seems clear that profits and self-interest are prioritized above any sense of responsibility, consistency, or customer care. The owner has repeatedly failed to open the business on time and rarely communicates when this happens — leaving families confused, frustrated, and sitting outside the door with their baby/toddler in frustration. Despite having paid for services that were supposed to be reliably available during stated business hours, there has been no consistency with their hours of operation.\nWhen events are cancelled there is no clear communication.\n\nThe lack of consistency is staggering. When families pay for a service — especially one that’s supposed to offer a dependable, supportive environment — the bare minimum expectation is that the service will actually be provided. Unfortunately, that just hasn’t been the case here.\n\nSave your time, money, and energy. More importantly, if you value your family or even the concept of value itself, look elsewhere. You deserve better.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christina C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We were looking for a new activity for our 2 year old to start after taking a break from tumbling. Looking through the local area we came across The Baby Bar! We have brought our daughter here at least a dozen times now and she LOVES it. She really enjoys all the different toys, especially the bounce house, trampoline and swings. Everyone we have met is so friendly, accommodating and helpful. A specific shoutout to all the hosts who have gone above and beyond to welcome our family and immediately made us feel so at ease in a new environment. The Baby Boutique is an amazing resource for affordable clothing and items, the events are fun for the kids, and honestly I have just had a wonderful experience here.\n\n(As a note, going to a play place s also just a great opportunity to see the toys and activities your child naturally gravitates towards while thinking of gifts. I have been able to choose what to get my daughter for her birthday and she gets to play, a win win for us both.)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mattania Chapman\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I was super excited to have my son’s first birthday party here and it turned out, not to be what I expected. I arrived at 12:50pm to get the room set up/oversee the progress (mind you the reservation was between 1p-3pm); to my surprise the room was set up for a Mrs Rachel party that took place at 3pm. They didn’t have my son’s decor ready nor was the room ready by 1pm. I left the facility at 1:15pm to go pick up the birthday boy. All of our family members were arriving and could’ve signed the play waivers for their babies but the employees waited until our arrival around 1:40pm to get the guests to sign waivers while making sure I understood I only had 20 minutes left in the party room. There was no reason why the guests couldn’t have played while we weren’t there. I provided their names to the staff previously and paid for their admission in advance. There was no reason why the guests couldn’t have enjoyed the experience. Later on while the children were enjoying their food, I was informed that the staff and owner went into the party room to clean it for the next reservation; the Mrs Rachel Party they had set up preciously.. There was no conversation to the children in the room to let them know “hey we are about to clean this room” they just started spraying their chemicals around their food and our sons birthday cake. As time went on, we (mommy and daddy) were enjoying this time with our family enjoying our sons birthday, when it was brought to my attention that one of the employees referred to my sons father as “are you the baby daddy”. Excuse me. There was no decorum nor respect in the place. We felt rushed, overlooked, bamboozled, and lied to. They sold us on a fantasy and it was proven to be a lemon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Becca Stoddard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My son’s play therapist recommended The Baby Bar as a way to help him socialize. We went for open play and it was hard to get the little guy to leave!!! We will be back, most likely for a birthday party in the future! Definitely give this place a visit, you’ll love it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Stoddard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: So my family ventured to this adorable and fun little establishment a week ago.\n\nI walked in and was immediately greeted by the staff member with a very warm and friendly welcome. The sign in process is simple, for anyone who has a bit of common sense & experience with literally any other waiver process. Scan the QR code, fill out the form online, made my payment and that was that.\n\nThe sheet amount of stuff to DO (play with, climb on, swing on, pretend play accessories, stacking or sticking together, read, wear) was surprising!! For a space this size, it is fully maximized! Not to mention the literal baby bar, little high chairs lined up at a bar with a TV playing all toddler friendly stuff while they can have Italian ice, juice, or snacks.\n\nThis place was literally perfection. I did notice a couple who was informed to stay out of the bar area, as it was for employee use only, directly disobey the minute the staff member left the area and began snooping through the contents kept hidden and out of reach behind the bar. So I would recommend the owner install cameras so she can protect herself against people with ill-intent. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brenda Cook\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place is just the coolest. I brought my wild grandsons here and they had more than enough to keep them busy and entertained. It was a fight getting them to leave! I had to promise that we would come back very soon. They loved the wooden climbing toys, the swings, and all the play pretend activities available. I only noticed one staff member, but she was a true delight. She mentioned that she had just started working there recently, but she was doing a great job playing doorman, hostess, “bartender”, and janitorial roles. We will be returning, as well as recommending to friends & family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Connor Stoddard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Took my son here and we had a great time. So many different age appropriate toys for him to play with and explore on. There was only one woman holding down the fort, she was checking folks in & slinging drinks from behind the bar, all while wiping down surfaces as she went. I was impressed with her attention to detail. We will definitely come back & bring friends with us. Highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Loftis\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I've been to the Baby Bar a few times now and I really want to like it, but the experience is just not great for parents or kids.\n\nEach time I've been there, it's been basically empty with staff sitting around bored, yet every surface is dingy and dirty. Floors look like they've never been vacuumed and the counters where kids are supposed to snack are sticky and unclean.  When a place as busy as the Children's Museum is spotless, it's hard to understand how The Baby Bar can be so filthy with several staff members and two guests.\n\nThe most recent time I went, there was a family there with a kid that was very clearly sick with a snotty nose and hacking cough. I was shocked that a sick kid was allowed to come in and play since one of the rules posted on the wall states \"no sick kids.\" The staff didn't seem to mind at all even though I wasn't the only parent to immediately leave after noticing the kid.\n\nI really tried to give this place a chance, but it seems worse each time I go and if I'm going to spend $16 I'd rather go to the Science Center or the Children's Museum.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelin Sullivan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My daughter absolutely loved The Baby Bar! It was the perfect solution to get her energy out before nap time! Her absolute favorite part was the swings! With the weather being so off and on lately, this was a much better option than taking her to a park. She is also at that age that the park is too much for her. This was just right with all of the age appropriate toys and no big kids running around. It is also a great place to actually play WITH your kids. No distractions of making dinner, laundry or cleaning the house. Just you and your baby. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: This morning we decided to try a new indoor playground, The Baby Bar. Entering the establishment for the first time, there is a lengthy admissions process to the facility that makes you want to just throw in the towel and the waivers come after you play🤔. The receptionist advised that there was hot coffee bar in the area and not to let the kids near it. I immediately posed my concern about hot beverages in a children’s play environment.  She said, it was for parents who wanted to enjoy that while their kids played. Once we reached the play area, we were aesthetically pleased with the age appropriate toys. After a few moments in, we noticed the “coffee bar” was more than what was originally described. If I’m being required to man an area so my kids don’t wonder, then I going to inspect it. I was in disbelief  when I saw open bottles of Brut, Smirnoff, beer and cleaning supplies, completely unsecured. I moved the open bottles to the counter to avoid any potential risk for any child. Moments later, my son fell due to a very unstable baby bench press toy. It was wobbly and not secured  at the joints. My youngest son and another little boy were near the personal belongings dresser, a random piece of wood fell off of it hitting the other baby in the face. The  dresser wasn’t even secured to wall to avoid a fall risk. That was it, we were out of there.\n\nThe cherry on top of our experience was when I called back and spoke with the owner. I’ve never heard so many excuses in a conversation. She stated, she never had any children wander behind the bar and it’s never posed an issue. The liquor is for hosted parties and catered events for parents who are okay with parents drinking in front of kids or ones that allow their kids to drink too. Weird, right!! She mentioned she had multiple bars in Greensboro and had all her permits. All I cared about is the safety of the children, mine and others, not your bars that require a I.D to drink.\n\nThe point is, if you want to run the risk of your child getting tipsy due to lack of securing open liquor, then this the place for you. Your unpaid job as the bouncer to the open liquor will not be enjoyable. We came so our kids could enjoy free play in a fun environment and it wasn’t at all. I hope they address these very serious concerns.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I really wanted to like this place and decided to try it for open play. The play area itself was nice, with a good selection of toys. However, we were concerned about the lack of childproofing throughout the space.\n\nThe shoe rack, standing about four feet tall, was not secured to the wall, posing a potential tipping hazard. The bar area was completely accessible to children, with open alcoholic beverages on the floor and cleaning solutions within reach—things you definitely wouldn’t want kids getting into. We did sign a waiver stating that parents are responsible for keeping children out of the bar area, but given how easily accessible it was, this still felt like a safety issue. Additionally, the bathroom had exposed outlets and switches without covers, which raised further concerns.\n\nWhile the concept is great, I hope they make necessary safety improvements to create a more secure environment for young children.\n\nNote: One of the other parents there at the time picked the two open wine bottles up and set them on the counter because they were not sealed in any way.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Benjamin Flemr\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Had my son’s first birthday here recently, and he and his 2 year old cousin had a great time!

With it so cold outside I can't take him to the park and I am at a loss for something to do. Libraries are nice but you don't want to be too loud! This place has a place for parents to eat and drink, and kids to play. A ball pit, chairs, slides and a small bouncy house. They also sold baby items for $1 and if you donated it would go towards you playing there. Anything leftover is donated to a shelter. I'm so happy we have this space and I wish all places had a center like this!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawanna Sykes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Itane Phillips\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We absolutely love the Baby Bar! We’re always welcomed with warmth and kindness. The Baby Bar has also offered a number of events that our child has enjoyed.

It is a great offering for families in the area and I hope more parents get to enjoy all it has to offer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: 5-Star Google Review for The Baby Bar\n\nThe Baby Bar is an incredible space for children to explore, learn, and grow. The Montessori-inspired play area is thoughtfully designed, providing endless opportunities for creativity and discovery. My son has not only enhanced his social skills here but has also built meaningful bonds with the staff and has opened up when he sees other children to play with. The music classes offered are amazing and engaging for all littles!\n\nWe were thrilled to host his first birthday party at The Baby Bar, and it was a fantastic experience! The owner and staff are always warm, welcoming, and accommodating, making sure every detail was perfect. It truly feels like a home away from home for our little one.\n\nI highly recommend The Baby Bar to any parent looking for a nurturing and engaging environment for their child.

I wanted to do a mommy and me Party for two for my daughters second birthday party! They understood my vision and executed it perfectly! From all the small details of the decorations like the balloon arrangements, floral arrangements, every little girl had her own cup and plate to decorate! The soft play area was a lot of fun they offered so much and even surprised us with a ball pit. They offered a photographer to do photos for each of the families! As a single mom I’m so use to having to do all the planning and organizing and they literally took the stress off for once! They helped with the set up and take down free of charge! It was definitely a special moment for not only me but every mother and daughter duo that attended! I definitely highly recommend!!!}",

Welcoming staff who are easily approachable and present. Great sitting area for parents including a massage chair.  Activities for children all ages (3D theatre, air hockey table). Not overwhelmingly large so easy to run after the children. Clean washrooms. Decent pricing compared to other indoor play places. Will definitely be coming back to let the kids burn all that energy off. Thank you Simply Play Kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DBains911\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This location is small but practical. An incident occurred where my child experienced a fall upon descending to the second tier of a raised surface. Despite my inquiry to the overseeing attendant regarding potential safety hazards that could result in injury, her lack of attentiveness was evident. Engaging in a conversation with another patron, the surveillance personnel displayed disinterest and neglected their duty of monitoring the children present.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reema Bennett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I've been to this place many times. Usually, the experience is okay, no issues. But last night, the guy at the front desk was so rude- he came up to us saying our baby can't be in the play area where my 3 year old son was playing because we didn't pay for her. She was just sitting there on the mat, she's too small to play with anything or go on the slides (which is why we didn't pay for her admission)\n\nAnd then my son had a ball in his hand that was already in the little coin car ride, he asks for the balls and points at the sign, and says you're not supposed to take the balls out of its designated area (he seemed to have a bad attitude) My son obviously can't read, he's 3. And also he was not the one who took the balls. They were already in the little car that he was playing with. We let him know the balls were in the car before my son started playing on it and left shortly after. I just feel like the staff should be kind, especially cause they work around kids. Will not be returning to simply play kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Georgia Leeanne\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had my son’s birthday party here and it was great.

From the moment we arrived, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed. The play area was safe, clean, and full of fun activities that kept the kids entertained for hours. The birthday package was well-organized, and they made sure everything went smoothly, from setting up to cleanup. My daughter and her friends had an amazing time, and I couldn’t be happier with how the event went. Highly recommend this place for any birthday party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gurpreet Singh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Thank you Gurpreet\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Just had our son’s 7th birthday party here.

I would definitely recommend it. The only downfall is that you only have 2 hours inside the rooms. Which for me it just felt very rushed and overwhelming to have the pizza, do the cake and the piñata especially with a young age group. Other than that the place is clean and my son had a blast.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karamjit Dhaliwal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Simply play is the best place to host your kid’s birthday parties, play dates and fun times during weekdays or weekends. Their After school program is also worth mentioning, the activities are curated to meet the capabilities of the kids. I have a wonderful experience with the staff and everyone at this awesome place.My kid love going there and I fully trust them for taking care of my child. Kudos to the whole team for doing wonderful job.👏👏👏👏\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: bhanu ghai\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We went this week on Monday as my little 3 year old had her Bday.

Have great Bday package offers along with great party halls.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rishi Mehrotra\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I have been taking my kids here since 2022. Even though there is a couple of other indoor playgrounds MUCH closer to us, we always make the drive out to Simply Play! The place is always spotless, the price is fair and my kids find the facilities a blast to play on.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, accommodating and they always put cleanliness and safety first. Thank you Simply Play for being our go-to indoor playground. Our kids are always happy (and tired) after visiting your establishment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ooh Fam\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Great location.\nIt is a fantastic indoor playground for older children during cold or warm weather.\nChildren enjoyed the 5D cinema as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Thank you D\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: This place definitely deserves 👏.. we have booked for a birthday party for almost 30 ppl. Everyone enjoyed kids as well as adults as there was 5D theatre some fun  for everyone. We don't have to bother about kids as they were busy playing and we're in secured area. No chance of any doubt. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for some kids party. And even the day full of fun especially in winters. It's a win win thing for kids entertainment.  Staff was so helpful especially Komal was very kind and helping. Even they helped in setting up room and moving things from door to the room. They stick to their commitment  and pizza delivery was rt on time. And pizza was good as well. Thank u for making our daughters birthday full of fun.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kat G\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Every time we've been here, it's been a negative experience.\n\nLast year we went during weekdays (wintertime) and the heating was kept low. The washrooms were not clean and the toys in the baby area were broken.\n\nToday we came again, and the place was packed with people. The heating was on, but the washrooms were equally dirty. This time fewer slippers and no step stool for kids. No paper towels in the dispenser. Toys still broken. If you want to exchange money for coins, they tell you that you'll be taxed on the transaction. The whole entryway area is nasty.\n\nI wish this place was better, but each time the experience was horrible.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tarun Manchanda\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sinema For kids\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Very unpleasant place. Totally overrated. Don’t waste your hard earned money. They charged 32$ for 2 kids and said u have 2 hours to play. When we asked for washroom as kids has to use said washrooms are out of service use from nearby stores. Moreover, this place so tiny and charging huge with time limits. Save your money and visit some good place. Big regret wastage of day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Venita Tahal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank you Venita\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaviraj Ramgoolam\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I take my kids all the time here.

The venue was very responsive, had great communication and answered all of our questions. Our guests gave us positive feedback and the kids seemed to really enjoy their time here. It was nice to see the adults feeling comfortable enough to sit and socialize while the kids played together throughout the spacious play place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meagan D\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Freeeeeeeeeeeezing!

The kids have fun, however the dude at the front desk was a little sketchy. We booked for a 20 kid party, then they tried to bill us for a 30 kid party, they would only accept that we wanted a 20 kid party after my wife produced the receipt, from the original deposit. She also confirmed that they would accept a tax exempt card upon booking, and they agreed. However when it came time to pay, they refused to accept the card. It is the last time we will be booking an indoor playground party, as our children have now aged out, but this last visit has negatively affected how I look at simply play and will most likely not recommend it to others.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olasumbo Awogbemi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Excellent personality and great experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jasbir singh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Thank you Jasbir\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pooja Pp\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: neat and clean ….lady on reception is very nice\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samik Shah\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Thank you Samik\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pankaj Sharma\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Thank you Pankaj\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Supreet Sirpal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Thank you Supreet\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Antonnette Smith\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I'd like to leave 5 stars, because my kids had a great time. However,  the disgruntled grinch at the front desk, almost made ruined the experience. He needs to take a course on customer service. He couldn't find our reservation, so I showed him my receipt. But he insisted that my children could not enter because I hadn't reserved. I showed him my receipt from his website and my paypal receipt, yet he continued to argue with me. In the end, all I had to do was fill out the waiver, but it took almost 15 minutes to understand the problem. He was very disrespectful and abrasive. I don't recommend this business, simply because of the poor management.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gurvinder Sujjon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It was good experience\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abhinav Chawla\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you Abhinav\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amrita Sidhu\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you Amrita\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Divya Nelluri\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A fun place for kids and adults with a lot of options and space.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shaun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: These guys deserve the 5 stars.\nThe employees are very nice and if they make a mistake they always try and make it right which is all we customers ask for, really.\nMy family has been there 2 times for a birthday party where the entire space was rented.\nAll in all, we had a great time.\nThe kids we happy, the prices are fair and we'll always come back.\n\nIf management is reading this, please take my suggestion here as constructive criticism with the best intentions.\nThe movie room is great. You got a nice little space for it and its certainly something not all play places have. So, with that said, I believe it would be a good idea to remove the huge grey filing cabinet and other junk beside it somewhere else where no one can see it.\nIt's a huge eye soar in such a great room.\nYou know what I mean? It's not crucial, but it would look way better.\n\nKeep up the good, safe, work.\nWe'll be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Remya Lekshmi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My boys had real fun at this place.

And interestingly enough, I have many friends with kids who live in this area and have never chosen to take their kids here and now I understand why. I like that it's close to my parents house however after reading some of the terrible reviews and the responses from the owner, I don't think I would entertain the thought of coming here. I'm afraid to even step foot into this venue as if I did leave a review that was negative, I feel that the owner would just respond saying it was my mistake in some way or another. And I've never felt that way before going somewhere...\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We've been here several times now, it's always a fun time.

Out of all the ones we’ve visited this one is definitely up there. It has a great variety of activities including a dedicated toddler area. It’s very clean and well kept.\nThis is my local one as I live in the area however the past 2-3 times we’ve visited I’ve noticed an unusual smell when I’ve walked in which was not there before (we’ve been coming for a year now) and it’s usually lingering around even when the place is empty. My last visit the playground was very busy which made the smell very prominent so we decided to leave. I mentioned it to the staff today and she said that there was have been leaks due to rain so I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing the smell. I hope the my can get it sorted because we really do love the place and can’t fault it otherwise.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cindy R\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Clean place for kids to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Saurav Dhanda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Kids love this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sakshi Singh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My toddler was happiest today at this place, we will visit frequently\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nazlene Baksh\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Was there to celebrate with my Grandson for his 2nd birthday. Very busy place. They're not too punctual with their timing of people who are already there. Making it difficult and less time for the next seating. My Grandson 2 hours time was cut into half, literally. Then we were kicked out because they had to accommodate the other group. I definitely wouldn't book anything here again. It was expensive too almost $800.00 that I was told had to be paid before we left. I DON'T know if a deposit was required to hold and book the venue. We took everything, decorations, cakes, foods, etc. We had to pay for the kids rides, etc. So I DON'T know what was the hype about. Perhaps because of the playground for limited amounts of kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael Dibua\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: You have to be here to love it.\n\nGod bless you Emeka and Ngozi and your staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: angela DiVarano\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brought my grandaughter here today, Wednesday October 11 and just wow website says it’s opened 2pm-8pm.

I LOVE THE NEW MANAGEMENT of this place and will come more often now!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ally Martin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We absolutely loved it! The open space was great for all the kids to spread out while playiny and running around. Theres was a good variety of pretend play and toys. My boy and his friends all had so much fun going from area to area, exploring. Also the girl working was so sweet and helpful with check in as well as making sure the play area stayed clean. We will definitely be visiting again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Golus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for kids and parents! My boys (3 and 6) get to enjoy the indoor playset or get creative with the multiple play areas (a grocery store, a farm, a kitchen, etc). I get to work on my laptop and enjoy coffee while having them within a clear line of vision so I can step in to help if needed.\n\nThe staff is friendly and somehow keeps the playroom tidy the entire time. It’s a safe and clean place for kids to play and interact.\n\nThis is such a great idea—I’m not sure why there’s not one in every city!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blair Rabun\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Smaller than expected and the equipment was not that great. We have a bigger play area at home than the one designated for babies, so it seemed like a waste of $12. The coffee was substandard, which is a real shame since there is a very good coffee shop right next door. Of course you can’t bring outside coffee in, but if they advertise themselves as a place to enjoy a coffee, it should be at least passable quality. I was also a little taken aback that there is no nursing area. I asked at the counter about a place to nurse and the employee said there was no area available. I don’t think we’ll be back unless significant improvements are made.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Paddenburg\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Great place for summer camps!! We had an amazing experience hosting here and can’t wait to come back again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Woodard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Perfect place for my toddler’s birthday. Small and quaint. Beautifully set up with kids in mind. The kids were able to play independently. All I had to do was show up. Snack table with fruit, vegetables, stickers, goldfish, apple sauce and honest fruit drinks. Plates, cups, utensils and water provided. I did not have to worry about a cake. I picked a Bluey themed party, and it was well thought out. Parents can get a variety of coffee - which was surprisingly good. They do provide pizza. We opted out and bought our own catering from Moe’s. They were open to this. Well priced. We will go back especially for parents’ night out.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelica Herrera\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I set up a playdate with a friend and we arrived to find it closed with no sign on the door for why it was closed during usual business hours. I tried calling but couldn't even leave a message because the inbox was full. We were really disappointed and had to figure out where else to go to cheer up the four kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bianca Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Ward TCTC\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Update --- there's a much better version of this in Easley called Kids Play & Cafe. My son and I love it.\n\nDon't bother. Customer service is lousy and management isn't much better. We've made two trips to use the Groupon I bought to try it out and are 0-2. Spent 15 minutes at the counter with other guests before anyone even acknowledged us, then told us they're closed for a party.  Owner insisted this was posted on the sign, it wasn't, then said it was on their website, wasn't there either. We'll pass.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zoe Harbison\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We were excited to check this out but it was a bit of a disappointment... Not nearly as much play equipment as the pictures show, and several of the few things were broken. The coffee was exceptionally bad (latte was cold when handed to us). We stayed for about 30 minutes and we were done. I understand they are under new ownership so hopefully they'll get things a bit more together soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Dinger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My daughter LOVES this play cafe! There is a variety of things for different ages to play with! She especially loved the new ball pit and baby swing that has been added! I took her there to meet Santa as well! Such a cute place to take the babies and such sweet owners and staff! We will definitely be going back! I plan on having her first birthday there because we loved it that much!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody R\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely love this place.\n\nThe new owners are a true blessing!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charles Owen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I took my two kids (2&3 yr olds) on a rainy Sunday afternoon and was amazed at this facility. It was very spacious, lots of fun little things for the kids to play on and with and it was very clean and well organized. The snacks at the Cafe are all reasonably priced and I could just chill and watch my kids in a safe and soft environment. Best of all my kids absolutely loved it and had a blast for hours. Highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had our daughter's 3rd birthday party here. We did an instant party in the mermaid theme. It was such a great experience. The staff were incredible, super friendly, and great with all the kids and just overall flexible (even when we made mid-party adjustments). All the kids had so much fun and didn't want to leave. Love that there's even a little place for babies to play. Overall, recommend for playing, and highly recommend for a birthday!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laurie Parish\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My granddaughter loves this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breianna Waller\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I LOVE THIS PLACE . I had my son’s first birthday party here back in March and it was a blast . The only reason why I didn’t give 5 stars is because it was EXTREMELY hot in there as if the a/c wasn’t working and the associate had my party time mixed up with someone else . I literally had to show her my email confirmation to prove my point .\n\nIt’s perfect for the smaller children 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Took my 18 month old here earlier this summer. Awesome concept! A few thoughts...\n\n-I would have probably given our experience 3 stars, but upped it to 4 stars because the most frustrating thing about our visit wasn't Palmetto Proper's fault! There was a mom there who didn't look up from her computer for over an hour. Her two kids were everywhere and climbing on all the things they weren't supposed to. It was really sad as one of them, who said he was 2, was starved for attention. He wouldn't leave us alone and ended up jumping on my daughter's head. Not sure how common it is for the parents not to be paying attention here.\n\n-I maybe had too high of expectations based on other reviews and we may have just come at a bad time since it was right before closing, but the area/toys were a little more rundown and dirtier than I was expecting (I know it's hard with kids!). There's no place in the area that I know of that rivals this place, but it seems like there definitely could be in the future.\n\n-Overall, I will probably not bring my child back until she is at least 3 years old due to safety/parents not paying attention. I do think that it would be worth renting out for a party though!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for kids to run off energy. Clean and friendly staff!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adele Hilliard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love going here.

Clean, friendly and very enjoyable atmosphere\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alicia Anderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My daughters & I adore this place. And the coffees are amazing! Very very clean and so much fun for the kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meridith Lokey\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Was hoping for a wow factor , but was just over all disappointed. We arrived for the first time to try this place out with our 3 year old.  It was ok. Placed an order for a coffee. 10 minutes later , still never received the coffee and had to remind the lady to make it for us. We were they only people there that had placed an order. The lady that was working was nice enough, but seemed most focused on her phone than customers. My husband finally received his coffee and it wasn’t even what he had ordered. We didn’t even say anything because we already had to remind her to make it … what was the point in mentioning that the order was wrong too ? We let our daughter play a little longer and then we left.  The play area itself is ok, it is small and toys are limited. But it was clean.  I wanted to love this place, sadly it just didn’t work out. Hopefully , other customers will have a better experience than we did.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Wendy Bergquist\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We took our grandson here to play on a very hot day, and he loved it. A very safe space with lots of different activities that drew his attention. I would highly recommend Palmetto proper.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth Oosting\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A great place to bring a toddler or young kiddo! Clean, safe, friendly, and while there's a lot of toys and snacks at the gift shop for kiddos to be tempted by, the coffee they also offer makes it worth it to me.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Wolfcale\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A true hidden gem!!!!!!!!!! I say that because I had never heard of this place. Absolutely loved it and enjoyed my time there with my children. My 5 year old had an awesome time, she was having a blast, while my 8 month old baby was able to safely play in their baby area! We enjoyed the nachos and an almond joy frappe too. The lady who was working was so incredibly friendly and very efficient at getting us checked in and making our snacks/treats. I felt everything was very reasonably priced. This was truly a treat and a great way to spend a rainy day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Kono\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Anna, thank you so much for taking the time to leave a review!

I enjoyed a delicious coffee while I watched them! Great indoor space for kids to run free, but contained! My 4.5 year old loved meeting other kids there too. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alvina\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I brought my four kids. It is GREAT!

The owner is amazing! I've followed her wherever she went since she had a consignment store and I'll continue to follow her and show my support!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Frye\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Tried to find a rainy day space for the kids to play - and we won’t be back. First the space was lack luster missing a true element of attraction. It felt like I was in someone’s basement with dirty toys and old odds & ends. Maybe small small kids would like this but nothing for kids over 5… maybe 4 max.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Malorie Schumann\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review.

Your 3 star rating is certainly not our norm, so I’d like to invite you to email us at PalmettoProperSC@gmail.com so that we can learn more about your experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justine Faataui\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: A great environment for the little ones!! She never once got bored 😊 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blakley Jones\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is best suited for very small kids and little girls. If you have a boy over the age of 2, I wouldn’t bring them here. There’s no room for them to run and it definitely can’t handle rambunctious kids. My son is 4 and I just felt like he was annoying all the girl and baby moms in here. These are my personal thoughts and experiences. The staff is very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey Ritchie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Gave this place 5 stars because my daughter loves playing here! Personally, the only thing I deal with is having to fight my daughter grabbing candy every time we come here. This really isn’t a critique, it’s just my own personal experience that stoped me from getting a membership to come everyday. I’m fine with buying her something healthier. The other places I don’t have to fight her because they don’t sell candy, they sell snacks. But when there is candy, she will choose candy over snacks. So it’s a fight in and out. However, she is learning that we don’t always get things we want. It’s just an awkward learning curb. But love the place and y’all are doing great.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Ring\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My kids LOVED this place!! We had so much fun doing all of the activities.  My 5 year old did not want to leave and wanted to stay until closing time.  My 7 year old is a big kid and still had so much fun!  The snacks and drinks were great prices and yummy!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash T\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I enjoyed the play area for my toddler sons. One is two years, and the other is almost one year old. The plane teeter-toter is a genius invention. My husband and I wish adults could ride.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Richard Fazio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great place for coffee and kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth Maruyama\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great and safe  indoor play ground.

The candy by the check out was ummm… not fun and how I managed to pay and keep the kids from grabbing some was a miracle but overall great place to take toddlers!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Valerie Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We celebrated my son’s birthday here, and he loved it!

If there is a private party booked your children can not play.\nWhich ican be extremely frustrating, and very inconvenient.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liz Hofius\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We hosted a 'you bring the party' birthday party for our, turning 2 - year old. You get a two hour time block in which to setup, play, and cleanup. For a simple, cost effective birthday, I highly recommend! The kids had a blast, the adults could monitor, but relax because everything is enclosed, and the party loft was everything we needed for kid snacks and cake! We will be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Geovanny Alvarado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great place for the little ones 👍 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krissy King\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We just hosted my 3 year old's Super Hero birthday this past weekend. It was our first time at Palmetto Proper. It was a great experience! We literally walked in and everything was done! All the decorations (which were well above others in the area) and themed for our party, fruit trays, pizza and cake. We had Spiderman make an appearance and he was very good at engaging our young crowd. We had face painting too! This was a great experience and I loved how the party hosts were very engaged to make sure we had a wonderful experience. We can't wait to go back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Pressley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love this place!! Very clean and pleasant atmosphere. My toddler loves it!!

Thanks and we will see yall again\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Bassett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had a birthday party there recently and I do not recommend spending your money there for it. They forgot we had added pizzas onto the party ($40 for 4 pizzas) and I spent 10 minutes proving that we did add it on to the party that we paid for. They acted like they didn’t forget and gave us 4 little Caesar’s pizzas to us which would have been around $27. I did not agree for little Caesar’s pizzas and if I knew that was the case I would have picked them up myself. I had to ask the lady working what time the pizzas were coming and she didn’t know about me ordering pizzas at all so unless I reminded them they wouldn’t have brought anything. Hey called and played it off like they didn’t forget. The women working were standoffish as well. I only gave 2 stars because the kids had a great time but the way everything happened put a sour taste in my mouth.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Elfner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: An unexpected gem in TR!

She really made us feel right at home. We have been going for 3 months now and we love it. Super clean facility, food, drinks, and COFFEE available at all times and a cute little shop that I love inside. Also been able to connect with other Mothers in the area , so that’s been so nice. Highly recommend you checking it out.

She’s creative and prefers to play independently, so it was great that there were only three other little ones in at the same time. She really enjoyed going around to all the activities and did not want to leave. Employee was super gracious and really cared that kiddo have a good time.\n\nOnly drawback was that most activities seemed perfect for little ones up to 4-5, but our tall one had to stoop to enjoy a lot of things, was too tall for bumper cars, etc.\n\nOn the whole, would recommend and return.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Casey Headley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Thank you, Casey!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madison Crymes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: We love this place!!

We have been going since it opened. The play set ups may change but the kid friendly environment doesn’t. My daughter is 3 and Autistic. It’s a great way to satisfy her sensory craving and have some social opportunities with peers while being in a safe space. It also allows my son who is 1 to find new friends to play with.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebekah Le Breton\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: It's a really cute concept because anywhere they serve caffeine at a place with parents is a good idea. However customer service is a bit lacking and the manager is unaccommodating and unapologetic. I felt like she did the bare minimum to get me to leave without a fuss. Also a good bit of the equipment is in poor condition or broken so it's disappointing they don't replace stuff. Also if you buy something make sure it's exactly what you want and if it's clothes, that it will fit perfectly, because there's only exchanges and if there's not anything else you'd like then you're out of luck. Overall I'll be heading to the children's museum or just splashing in puddles on rainy afternoons.\n\nEDIT: my review was originally a 3 star, but after the most unprofessional response from a business owner I've received I lowered it to 1 star. I won't be using the remaining amount on the gift card that I received for returning a shirt that was able to be re sold because of the owners completely unapologetic attitude and unwillingness to make  anything right. I'm glad that she was able to make double the money off the item but one has to wonder if it's worth it when you're losing any future business.\nP.S. Please at least replace the Melissa and Doug grocery store set up, if you haven't already, before a child gets hurt on the broken plastic.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nathan Gilmer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Love this place.

We had kids ranging ages up to 11years old and they all had a blast and can't wait to go back! The staff are all so friendly and went above and beyond! A few of our guests even enjoyed the shop during the party! Overall Palmetto Proper is definitely a place our family will visit again and I will recommend them to everyone I know! Thank you for such an awesome first experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krystal Kusak\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: This is a cute concept but overall is not likely an establishment I will revisit. I give three stars for cleanliness and the variation of engagement opportunities for kiddos. For me the negatives included a lot of rules up front. Of course cleanliness and safety are of utmost importance so I understand some need for structure, but too many rules takes the fun out of the experience in my opinion.\n\nThe first rule included that the different category toys needed to be kept in their stations and then anything moved from their original place must be put back before leaving by the parent. I stay home with my children so every day I spend a significant amount of time picking up after them. When I pay to take my toddlers to a play place, the last thing I want to have to do is pick up after my kids, all while making sure they are safe and not making more of a mess in another area. Honestly, I understand why they have this rule because it could be pure chaos with a lot of the smaller toys and a packed house, but we frequent other places specifically Chippy's bounce house and we've never been asked to keep things together or put them back. I do try to be respectful and tidy as we go, but I don't want the responsibility of picking every item up that they played with. My whole opinion is that picking up and putting back should be a service provided by the staff. The second rule was no food or drink in the play area and that makes a lot of sense for children because they're messy. However, the whole concept of this place is a gift shop cafe and play place. The attendant asked me if I wanted a drink and I really didn't care for one but ordered anyways to further support the small business. Apparently I naively didn't think that the drink rule applied to adults and I brought my hot drink inside the play area and was drinking it around the perimeter. Within the first few minutes the attendant came over and told me no drinks were allowed in the play area and to please drink over the gate. It just doesn't really make sense to sell hot coffee for parents to enjoy if it can't be done while supervising children within the play area. Maybe that rule works ok for parents with older children, but mine are toddlers and need to be watched pretty closely. Being reprimanded although respectfully, coupled with having to clean up after my kids with  other children still playing in areas where mine had made messes, just left me feeling bothered.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cynthia Hernandez\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My kids loved this place !!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Monroe\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Would have been an awesome place to play if not for the staff. I’m not sure if the lady just worked there or if she is the owner but she made the experience unpleasant.  Most indoor play places do a routine pick up every hour or so…. This lady decided that it was better to walk around scolding  the children or yelling from behind the counter for them to keep the toys in their specific play areas.   Imagine trying to tell 3 year olds and under that they can’t take toys from this side of the room to ten feet to the other side of the room.  My kids were too small to be moving things around at the time but seeing the other kids get scolded for BEING CHILDREN AT A PLACE MADE FOR THEM TO PLAY, made it awkward and uncomfortable.  I’ll be taking my money to village play from now on, they have a better space, better play equipment, and friendly staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael Madden\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: Didn't really visit any shops there, but it's worth a look see.

The 3 stars is because I do see improvement in this establishment. We travel across the state to visit these types of children play places monthly. The space is tight when crowded but not much can be done regarding that. There was little room to move up and down the walkway to find my children. It became a little unsafe with kids running in and out of the big kid area into the walkway. I loved seeing a 5 and under area. With that being said. I wish the door would lock and not allow for the littles to push open on their own. Additionally if there is a 5 and under area I would like for some monitoring to keep the larger kids out of it. I was disappointed in seeing 8yrs and older inside this area. Twice my children were hit in the face by feet due to the lack of these older children not paying attention to the smaller children. One of the bigger kids jumped onto my 1yr old flattening her and then ran off laughing. We had a 2hr play pass and I stayed for 45 mins because the general area was becoming unsafe. I understand that it was opening week and they still need to tweak their policies and procedures. We will give it another try in the future and I'm willing to change my review if that visit shows improvement.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shania Robison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I took my 9 year old and 2 year old sons today.

Great addition to town.\n\nOnly constructive criticism was for the ice chest in the grocery, those ice cubes traveled far and I found a few in the littles area. Those are a major choking hazard so I turned them into staff for sanitation to make their way back to where they belong. Just do your part as the parent (self explanatory) and you’ll be fine. Everything else was fine!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marissa Kotkin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My son loved coming to Native Play!

Today there were so many infractions by the manabi team and he did not give them a yellow card. It is known that the owners of the lunch box sponsor the Manabi team but in soccer you have to be fair. Since each team is playing with their heart and with the desire to win fairly. Like the other team, the Red Aces, as I read, the shirts played with their soul since they want to reach the final for their effort. As a spectator I was very surprised that the referee named Jairo did not read many fouls from the Manabi team, I hugged players like #18 who when he made a foul (Manabi team) only laughed at the referee and that seemed like a lack of respect to me. Many, many times during the game this happened. One who lives the game since I am a fan, I always go to the field at the Ford Nations (Ramblewood Soccer Complex) to watch the teams play. I am very disappointed that the games are not fair. I hope that someone like the owner of global sports finds out about today's game and hires honest referees for future games.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liliana Hernandez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David Hernandez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Antoni Barrientos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reynaldo Cubas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luis Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great time playing soccer\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elder Yanez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It is necessary to invest in the business, the field is already very deteriorated\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jose Castillo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It is an exceptional place to recreate through football\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cinthya Harkey\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: All these years and the owner does not put a dime on keeping up with the place, owner please invest on a decent turf on the ground, Global Sports come on....carpet on the floor is horrible.

There is a good variety of interactive and stimulating toys, and new toys/play stations are rotated in and out periodically. A big point for me is that the play area is kept clean. I don’t know what their sanitation process is, but my son hasn’t gotten sick from playing here. That’s a HUGE PLUS! Shoes are to be taken off and only socks are to be worn in the play area. Food and drinks are only allowed in the lobby area, where they also have coffee/tea/alcohol and snacks for the kiddos. The staff and owner have been really friendly.

My drink was not great. It tasted like watered-down milk with a little bit of chia flavor. Will need to figure out how to specify getting a good outcome.\n\nI have been investigating the area for great indoor play spaces and taking my \"nanny kid\" to test run each one.\n\nI was excited to see this one open. it appeared on the website, which leaves a lot to be desired, that this was a café with a kid friendly atmosphere.\n\nI arrived with my cohort, 2 y.o. male, only to discover they do, in fact, charge for children. Also, they have a time limit. But I viewed the play area, and it was wall to wall parents standing around chatting and littles toddling about. There was no space to run or be a 2 y.o. We had to leave.\n\nI was not subjecting my l'il to that. We traveled across town to Cary and tried out Notasium. He thrived there, and though it had about the same amount of folks, the space itself was bigger. Still, it is suggested, \"An indoor playground should generally contain at least 150 square feet of room per child. This can, however, vary depending on the age of the children...\"\n\nSo, far Over The Moon has been his favorite and the time limit, though less then Bumble Brews ends up being over much because he literally spent 40 of the 80 minutes there running... full out.\n\nI feel this place would \"bee\" excellent for anyone with pre walkers.\n\nI plan to visit again when I have a client with a pre walker.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalie Ure\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great space for my son’s 2nd birthday party.

Unfortunately though during our time he took quite of big fall off the large place set. He’s all good! Thankfully he’s a tough cookie! In the short chaos of the situation the staff was incredible. Both girls working were very kind, quick, and attentive to check up on us and offer ice if need be. But! What made the biggest difference for me was how the owner took time out of his day to personally call and check up on us which is obviously something he didn’t have to do but he did and it meant a lot to my husband and I. It shows he truly cares about his customers. We will be back hopefully sometime soon and will continue to bring our son back to play. Thank you guys again! You are all wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yelyzaveta Tokarieva\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Weickert\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Such a clean, exciting, and perfect environment for kiddos!

I have a 1 year old who has fallen in love with the variety of toys, climbing equipment, and meeting new friends in our community. While it’s great for the kiddos, it’s also perfect for adults - you can grab a coffee, tea, or beer while your little one mingles! Highly recommend checking this place out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christopher Sayles\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Space is much smaller than I anticipated and it was PACKED the afternoon we went, but the folks at the desk were very kind and it was a place to let our kids play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalie Marcheschi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We had my daughter’s birthday here and it was so much fun!

Even tho it was a very short notice they worked with me and helped with everything I needed.\nPlace is very clean and I love how they really implement the socks policy for everyone.\nOnly thing I would had loved for next time is to have someone helped picking up just because there is like a short time.  Would definitely have them as a top of mind for next birthday event.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devin Bell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Nice place for kids to go and for adults to relax.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maddie Hoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had my son's 1st birthday here and it was the absolute best time! The facility was set up specifically for our guest list at arrival and everything was clean, neat, and organized. The staff was extremely helpful throughout the entire event. The process from start to finish was so easy and we were able to truly just enjoy our little guy's first birthday. All of the guests had a blast and complemented the facility and staff. We will definitely be back for open play and future birthday parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tara Crossan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very cool place.

We cannot thank them enough!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leah Gardner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter's 3rd birthday party here, and it was wonderful! Both the play area and the party room are spacious. We had more than enough room for 15 kids and 20 adults to play and socialize. There was great variety in play structures and toys, so the kids were kept busy. It was also very clean. I would 100% host another party there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olivia Lynch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Accidentally stumbled across this coffee shop/indoor playroom today with my 19-month-old daughter, and it was the most wonderful surprise!

We will most definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Owens\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We recently celebrated our daughter's 3rd birthday at Bumble Brews Raleigh, and it was an absolute hit! The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly, making sure every detail was taken care of. The space was perfect for the little ones to run around and have a blast. If you're in Raleigh with young children, Bumble Brews is a gem!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joanna Raimo\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very fun place! My daughter is 10 months and loved our time there. Staff is very friendly. And for $10 it’s worth the time. My only concern was there are a good amount of puzzles and toys with smaller pieces that could cause issues with littles so I felt I had to be extra vigilant. My only complaint is the play house is really flimsy and cheap looking, not like a good fisher price house that’s sturdy. And the changing station in the bathroom was super small and the trash can was no where near it making changing diapers clumsy and more challenging.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Banks Allison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had the best time celebrating our 4 year old's birthday party at Bumble Brews Play Cafe. The owners are super friendly and accommodating. They have legitimately thought of everything. Bumble Brews turns the chaos of a kid birthday party into a stress-free, fun and memorable event. Highly recommend. P.S. this place is SUPER clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Summerlin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We drove from Tarboro to go to one of the larger Raleigh parks. We were rained out so we ended up here. The kids loved it! All of the equipment is clean and safe. The owner was friendly and helpful. He kept things clean and made the best (very cheap) latte. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Fritts\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 18 month old LOVES this play space and I always feel comfortable and safe bringing him here. The toys are so varied and plentiful that we always find a new way to play every visit and everything is clean. There have been a few afternoons where we were one of a few families and it was perfect for little ones who get overwhelmed. The lattes are delicious and the staff are always so kind. This is one of our favorite indoor play spaces in the area!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raizha Yurivilca\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Woow my 20 month LO loved this place.

Bumble brews is our favorite place to bring our kids in Raleigh. It is immaculately clean, has such a variety of toys, and the owners are amazing people. You feel like family when you are here and the coffee is so good. Get yourself a coffee or adult beverage and come here to watch your kids have the time of their lives.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: danielle teibel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such an amazing place to have a birthday party; could not recommend this place enough!! They make it easy so easy and the kids had an absolute blast. Parents were able to hang out and relax while kids entertained themself in a confined and safe space.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meaghan Toon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We are so glad to have a Bumble Brews close to home, and loved hosting our girls' birthday party here recently! They turned 2 and 4 so we had a shared party with about 30 toddlers running around. The Bumble Brews team made planning and hosting the party SO EASY and fun! Communication is straightforward, the staff is super friendly, and the facility is clean and well run. It was nice to have a safe space for the kids to play while adults were able to chat and relax (as much as you can with 30 toddlers running around). They have thoughtful add ons like table cloths and decor, and allow you to bring in whatever food you prefer for your party. We hosted a morning party so adults enjoyed coffee - and it was on pa with some of our favorite coffee shops in the area. We will definitely be regulars at Bumble Brews Raleigh!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Feven Bedard Khalid\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you Feven!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Shaul\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Bumble Brews is such a gem & an incredible place!! Not only is it an indoor & interactive play place for kiddos, but it's a great gathering spot with a coffee bar, beers on draft, cute merchandise, and a wonderful & happy atmosphere. I love visiting with the children of my friends (so many fun exhibits/toys/creative play places!), and it's charming in every way. The decor and ambiance are spot on, the space is so creatively designed, and you can tell both kids and their parents/caregivers are prioritized. We're huge Bumble Brews fans -- and still think about the superb honey latte they make!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Murphy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I can't say enough good things about Bumble Brews Raleigh! As soon as you step through the doors, you're greeted with vibrant colors and an atmosphere buzzing with joy and excitement. It's truly a haven for both kids and parents alike.\n\nThe concept of combining an indoor play cafe for kids with a space for parents to relax and enjoy a drink is pure genius. It's like a mini vacation for families! The kids get to run wild and play to their heart's content in the safe and engaging play areas, while the parents can unwind and socialize over a cold beer or a glass of wine.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me is how well-maintained and clean everything is. I appreciate the attention to detail in ensuring a hygienic environment for the little ones to play in.\n\nAnd let's talk about the staff - they're absolutely fantastic! Friendly, attentive, and always ready to lend a hand or offer a smile. They truly make you feel like family from the moment you walk in.\n\nWe hosted our daughters’ birthday party here and it was so much fun!  We invited both our friends and the kids closest friends, blasted our own music, and had the best time and dance party lol!  The owners were so fun to work with and went above and beyond to make sure the girls party went off without a hitch!\n\nI love that there are signs everywhere reminding guests to wear socks, explaining time limits, among other things, so there really aren’t any surprises when you come to play!  The attention to detail does not go unnoticed to your community.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Bumble Brews Raleigh to any parent looking for a fun and unique outing with their little ones. It's a gem in the community, and I can't wait to visit again soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nancy Yarnell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is amazing!! I just visited for the first time with my 11 month old and our experience was 10/10. The coffee is amazing, staff were so nice and helpful, and they have a great range of little play areas for crawlers and for slightly older kids. They keep the areas clean and have a “tasted toys” bin for ones that need to be sanitized. I highly recommend visiting, and can’t wait to go back in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan Bond\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is a parent’s dream! A perfect spot no matter the weather for both caregivers and children to enjoy themselves. You can see the love and attention to detail in every aspect of BB! It’s obvious the owners are parents themselves!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlin Myers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had our son’s 2nd birthday party here and it could not have been a better experience! February birthdays can be hard with the weather but we didn’t have to worry about that at Bumble Brews!\nThe party room is awesome, we just brought food and balloons and it was perfect! The play room is so great, it had plenty of activities to entertain all the kids ranging from infants to 4 year olds. We rented out the whole place and it was amazing. The kids were able to run around and play and burn some much needed energy. None of the kids wanted to leave when the party was over.\nThe best part is that the staff helps with clean up! It’s truly designed with kids and families in mind. There’s even stools and full on changing tables in both bathrooms, high chairs for the party room, low to the ground tables so the kids don’t have to climb. It was a hit with adults and kids alike. We will definitely be back for playing and will consider for birthday parties in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kendall Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you Kendall, we are grateful for your support!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathryn Perkinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thanks so much for your support, Kathryn!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlyn Fornes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Bumble Brews Play Cafe in Raleigh is a very fun and cute indoor play space/cafe!

It wasn't crowded either!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cyndi Riegger-Ludwig\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A cute space! Very busy when we came today but I suppose that just speaks to how much people love coming here which isn’t a bad thing. My son is 16 months (looks older, he’s a big boy) and he may have been a little overwhelmed. We only stayed about 30 minutes for our first visit today. We’d love to come back when it’s less crowded, whenever that is! Cute play place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin Tilton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Ive been meaning to write this review for a while and time got the best of me!  We took our 2.5 and 5.5 year olds to Bumble Brews before Christmas - they met Santa and played for an hour and a half.  This place is amazing!  Super clean.  Super friendly staff.  Wonderful drinks (they knew how to make a London Fog and not many places do!).  We will definitely be going back (its hard to find many places that both of our kids enjoy)!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Ardito\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Wonderful play place for kids!  My 7 year old even loves it. Super clean, amazing staff/owners and convenient for parents who want a safe and fun environment for their kids to play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Gulish\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is rude and definitely have fluctuating capacity limits. There’s no system in place to keep track of kids and parents and no limits on play. Otherwise has potential to be a good spot.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haley Brooke\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Not impressed. $10 for an hour and a half of play inside a small crowded room with dirty toys and not much to do. They have a nice jungle gym in the middle, but definitely not for kids older than three.\n\nTo add to owners comment below:\n\nI expressed it was our first time here and NO ONE told us when I paid and order coffee that is was no shoes and socks required or I would’ve paid for the socks initially with no issues. After getting my daughter settled playing, I noticed myself no one else had shoes on (several toddlers with bare feet also) so I took off my daughters and my shoes how about the same time one of the employees also came to inform us about being “ a no shoes facility”. Again, but no mention about socks being required. Then roughly 20 minutes into playing another time friend came up clean and said that sock are actually required and that we would need to leave or buy socks. at this time, more embarrassed than anything, I decided to leave. It wasn’t and I informed him not to worry about it, that he would be leaving.\n\nMy five year-old daughter told me herself several times that she didn’t like that place and it was for babies. I am glad you are able to market to higher age group, but that doesn’t change some of the toys being dirty, it being a small and overcrowded room or that all the toys that were available were most definitely for smaller children under 3. Thanks for your response but trying to blame me for your unclear rules just makes it more clear how under valued your customers are. Good luck in the future. My review is nothing but honest to hopefully save another parent from wasting their hard earned money as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pascal Burns II\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love the friendly staff & the great atmosphere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathleen Gamble\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have loved exploring Bumble Brews!

Everything is scrupulously clean, the toys are engaging and plentiful, and the drinks are just a bonus! So nice to meet up with friends after work who also have kids, kill some time before dinner and bed, and enjoy a glass of wine. Happy mom and tired kids! 10/10 from me!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allie Roepe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So excited this new play cafe is open!! We've been twice and both times service was so friendly, coffee delicious (try the honey latte!) and the space is beautifully curated. My kids didn't want to leave and the cafe area is great for me to hang!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ginny Supranowitz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love everything about Bumble Brews -- beautiful, spacious play areas with so much to do for many ages. I enjoyed watching children explore, engage with children they met for the first time, and use the variety of playthings. The owners seem committed to making this a positive experience for all! And ... can't beat the coffee! Highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Went recently and had the best time!  It was extremely clean and loved the variety of toys. This is a great place for a playdate for kids and adults. They host birthday parties and looks like a bunch of other things upcoming. I love the location as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Casey Webb\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Bumble brews is our new favorite indoor place to play! The owners are super sweet and welcoming, and the drinks are awesome. If you go, make sure to get the Honey Latte. We started coming when my daughter was 10 months and still crawling and it’s still perfect for her age. They have a “baby” corner with age appropriate toys which is where we spend a lot of our time. They have a “tasted toy” bin to ensure that toys that are put in kids’ mouths are properly cleaned and sanitized. It seems to best suit kids aged 1-4/5 but I have definitely seen kids a bit younger and a bit older enjoying themselves! If you do go- make sure you wear socks! Also, the afternoon is always a bit less crowded than the morning if you prefer a more quiet setting (see fourth picture- that was early afternoon and we were the only ones there!). Overall, we are super happy and we love having a membership there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Margaret Long\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Bumble brews is amazing! I love to actually enjoy my coffee while my toddler toddles around. It’s in a great location and the people are super nice. We will definitely be having our next birthday party there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Chehanske\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cannot recommend this play space enough!! Perfect for kids 5 and younger. I have a 2 year old and almost 4 year old very active little boys and they didn’t want to leave! Lol good thing delicious lattes and beer/wine is also served for the parents so we can relax too! Also, triple bonus that this space is actually esthetically pleasing and not color/sensory overload. It’s just a beautiful space overall and I love seeing my boys play with toys I never would’ve considered buying!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kensley Pleasant\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We have a 1 year old and absolutely love taking him to Bumble Brews!

A win-win for all!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Milhouse\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a wonderful play area for kids, rain or shine! My 2 year old gets very hesitant in new places sometimes and she ran right in ready to play. The coffee was delicious, they have a tv in the cafe area my husband enjoyed with football being on, and the covered parking made it so easy to get to and from on a rainy day!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bethany Griffith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is pure magic! Such a beautiful and fun play space for the littles and the perfect layout so adults can enjoy their (delicious!) coffee and chat together. Delighted Bumble Brews is open just in time for indoor play on chilly days.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bonny Lewis\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We arrived when it opened, and it filled up quickly. It was a few too many people for such a small space. I hope they schedule playtime slots to reduce the crowds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsey Fisher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 15 month old loves it here. We’ve been a couple of times and she is always so sad to leave! There are so many fun areas for kids to explore, and so many fun toys! Their cafe area is SO cute with the best wallpaper. They also make great lattes and have a great wine and beer selection.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Franchi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Highly recommend Bumble Brews Raleigh!!

We are lucky to have this place here for our kids to enjoy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: KELSEY CYRUS\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We came during a rainy day where playing outside wasn't an option. This was a perfect alternative! They have a TV for parents (it was Sunday, so they had football on) and beverages. My husband got a draft beer and I got a delicious honey latte. I would highly recommend this place for toddlers; my 2 year old son had a great time and there were plenty of fun toys to play with to keep him busy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our time at Bumble Brews in Raleigh and will definitely be back! I was worried the parking might be an issue but it’s right beside a covered deck so there was plenty of parking in addition to the lot that’s right out front. The owners were so friendly and engaging with all the customers. The Santa event was very well organized. I was happy we ventured out on a rainy afternoon so my son got some energy out while I enjoyed a delicious honey latte!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abby Welch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun place for younger kids!! The coffee was amazing too!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Irina\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My almost 2 year old really enjoyed it and this was the first one he went to that he cried when we left! They had a bunch of activities catering to a wide range of ages and even being there for 2 hours my son didn’t get bored once! The staff was super friendly when my son bumped his head they asked if I wanted an ice pack. My husband got 2 beers and football was even on for him so he enjoyed it just as much as our son did!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pressley Frevert\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 1.5 year old and I stopped by today and spent a delightful hour here. My son is all about climbing right now, and I love that Bumble Brews had ample places for him to do so (safely) while I drank a chai! Bumble Brews is a step above other play cafes: The decor is adorable, the space is clean and welcoming, and the toys and various sections are so inviting for kids. We will absolutely return!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ginna Neel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a fabulous play cafe in such an awesome location! Every detail is so thoughtful and adorable. The drinks were amazing and the staff is so friendly. My kids had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adelyn Finley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is fantastic for littles (and their people). It could not be cuter, cleaner, or more fun. My three year old niece had the best time and was especially delighted by the reading house (in her words “so cozy”), play set, and stage complete with a little piano and tiny cymbals. And while she played, I got to enjoy a truly fantastic latte (up there with Jubala & Optimist lattes - I’d swing by for just the coffee to be quite honest)! So thrilled this is in the area and I can’t wait for many more fun play time here with the kiddos in my life!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haylie Awar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So so cute and the littles loved it! I’m a sahm and have been waiting to find somewhere age appropriate (1yr and 2yr olds), definitely going to be the new go to. Also insanely good lattes !!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tarun Kalidindi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Excellent for toddlers}",

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy. Tons to do for everyone and accommodates all group ages from babies to teens! The staff always goes above and beyond to make your visit nothing short of amazing!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shania Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Came here for my nieces birthday party! Absolutely adorable place for the little ones!! If you can speak with Francine!!! She did an amazing job with communicating everything and helping my sister out!! Huge shoutout to her!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Craig Lilly\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Francine did an amazing job keeping all customers happy and everything running smoothly\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Terry Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: My daughter had so much fun here and was so happy with the way the workers treated her especially Krysten. When it was time to go my daughter told me all the nice and sweet things Krysten did for her. I’m so happy that a worker like Krysten could make my daughter have a memorable experience and one she won’t forget.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy W (Mother of 3)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great for the price. Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog. Very impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yesica Robles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great place for kids !

The staff are so genuine, I had amazing interactions with Kyrsten, Francine, Zoie, and Andrew.. made me feel so welcome and at home with their smiling faces. The place is always sanitary and spotless as I see them picking up and cleaning constantly. Perfect place to let kids unwind after school.

I had the privilege of speaking to one of the supervisors Francine who was so nice. Kyrsten was so personable as well. Jaylin is a true GEM and frankly beautiful inside and out. You truly have an A team here. Wish your business all the success and I will be back very soon!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brian Thalhamer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Great place to have simple fun without all of the strobe lights and other distractions a lot of other places have.

My 2 year old had a blast!! All the staff is fantastic, but Francine was AMAZING!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalie Mays\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job! I love to support other businesses. My kids adore Francine, she is such a sweet person. She really goes all out. Every staff member was super nice though!!

When she was upset Kyrsten helped her. It truly warmed my heart. She is definitely one of my favorite workers at Plum Krazy I will definitely be back with Emma!! I’ll be spreading the word on my pleasant experience. Thank you to all of the Plum Krazy Staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Toni K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Brought all my grandkids here and they had a ball!

This place is amazing! The most fun we have ever had in a play place!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Akisha Hunt\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place was absolutely perfect it was just what I needed for a Saturday afternoon with my niece and nephew and granddaughter. Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

Such a nice indoor play place for kids of all ages! There is a nice little section for kids under 3, so they are sectioned off and can play freely in their own area while it still being open for parents to see bigger kids play as well! We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it! All of the staff is super friendly and attentive! We always have a great time here! I also had a question for management and they handled in such a friendly way. Let this be your sign to take your kids for a fun play date!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Kinder\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love playing here.

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kambrianna Norton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

I had my daughter's 5th birthday there and it was amazing! They even set my decorations up for me and helped cleaned up afterwards! They were very personable and helped with any need we had. Staff were all super friendly and helpful. I love all the concessions they have as well. And the fact that I can fit in the play maze and play with my daughter.

From the moment you walk in, you’re struck by how immaculately clean and thoughtfully designed the space is-it’s inviting, calm, and never chaotic.\n\nWhat sets Maple apart is the passion and vision of its owner, (Aly)  a devoted homeschool mom who pours her heart into every detail. She’s created something truly special and brings in licensed teachers to lead and support her programs, which I love and admire.\n\nThe programs are constantly evolving and improving, which is something I deeply appreciate, it shows a genuine commitment to growth and excellence. The children are learning so much, and doing so in a way that feels joyful and natural.\n\nAnother standout feature: it doesn’t smell like food or stale coffee like most kid spots. Instead, Maple diffuses On Guard essential oils, making the air feel fresh and clean. They offer complementary coffee for parents, but it blends seamlessly into the atmosphere without overpowering the space.\n\nAbove all, Maple feels like a true community. The owner is incredibly present and engaged with the families, and you can feel the warmth between parents as they connect and build friendships here. It’s more than a business—it’s a beautiful labor of love. A total breath of fresh air!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lanae Hall\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: HIGHLY recommend!

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.

She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles.

They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

You can get snacks here or you can bring your own as long as they are no nut products. The bathrooms even have diapers and a Change of clothes if needed! We’re so excited about it. You sign your waiver, take off your shoes, and play.

Great relaxing place to let your kid(s) run around without having to tell them no every 5 min. It’s a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.\n\nSaturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.\n\nI wish there were more gates around doors here though, I’ve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darien Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebastian M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners, the play sets, the crowd, the snack options are really nice and all for a reasonable price.\nI will definitley recomend and come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morar Daniela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Lovely, amazing, super clean place with helpful staff and reasonable prices.\nI’ll be looking to get some sort of membership, my 4yo loves it! 🩵🩵🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impressions are that this place is good fun for the littles.

They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place!

It's big and has plenty of stuff for kids to do, and situated between a coffee place and food store - so it's easy to grab a snack or drink!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Cameron (Kim)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My child loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Beam\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.\n\nWe arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it!

Nice relaxing environment. I love that there is a separate little dining area. We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business. My daughter is 3.5 yrs. old. She had as much fun playing at Funky Frogz today as she had ever had anywhere else! Funky Frogz offers a special atmosphere for toddlers through young children to play together, and to learn through playing. 5 star experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: H and E\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My daughters love Funky Frogz.

My children ages 1 and 4 could stay here all day . There is so much to do , it's great for short attention spans . There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos. Taylor & Nate did a great job bringing this idea together, and our oldest has an absolute blast every time we go.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Nance\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Funky Frogz is awesome!!! Went with our little one today and she had an absolute blast. There are so many different play areas that kids of all ages can enjoy. They brought the fun of Marbles kids museum in Raleigh to Sanford and we loved it. We will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Allison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cate Niezgoda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 3 and 4 year old played primarily independently for two hours with a quick snack break. They have snacks to purchase if you aren't having a \"Pinterest parent\" organized sort of day. I was able to sip on a cold brew while they wore themselves out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ed Quigley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great indoor play space. Clean, bright, lots of activities.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Vaughan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Funky Frogz is exactly what Sanford needed for kids! A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

Amazing communication and camp handbook to help prep kids for the activities at camp. We love knowing what they’ll learn each day so we can talk about it before and afterwards. Can’t wait to send our little kiddo there too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Pierson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Areli Morales\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Such a beautiful place! I have taken my daughter here several times and it’s always clean, neat and organized. The place is great for  small  children with lots of room for them to explore. I hosted my daughter 2nd birthday and everything was organized well. Staff communicated well and were able to help with any question that I had.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tamara Schlez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: We loved the place and  the environment. The only thing is that they give really short time to prepare food/tables in advance and everything is very timely structure. The kids where having a lot of fun and I think it would be nice to have more time in the play area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexis Bolick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We hosted our daughter’s 4th birthday party at the WonderLab and we’ve attended many classes and open play!

Place is clean, toddler friendly and very different activities they can do. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaiti David\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It’s a nice playroom and I would come back to let my son play in the playroom but I would never have a birthday party here again. They rushed me through the party, didn’t give much time at all to set up and I felt as though I didn’t get enough time to actually enjoy my son’s 1st birthday. The party ended at 3:30 and we had to be out at 3:30, so having to clean up shortened the party even more. They put you on a set schedule and I felt stressed the whole time to stay on schedule. The staff kicked us out of the party room 30 min early to clean up for the next party and took my decorations down before I even got pictures :/ and they said they wouldn’t touch my decorations.\n\nI think this would be a decent place to have a party if I wasn’t so rushed and had more time before and after to set up/clean up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Martin Pruitt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Staff was super helpful!

Recommend for parties and for general play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rach\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: The play space was really nice and the staff was helpful.

Just drove 20 minutes to be told they’re booked until 1:30.  Doesn’t go over well with the kids to get back in the car instead of playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Josh Alman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Glad you had a good time!

We’re hoping to sign up for camp again next year!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: lisa gatti\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Very well organized and run.

My 5 year old tried three camps this Summer & said Wonderlab was her favorite. This was our 3 year olds first camp experience (attends preschool though) and she wanted to return to Wonder-lab Camp next week.  They enjoyed the mix of art, science, play, & being outside some.   Everything was very organized for parents & the staff was awesome.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Harsh Parikh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Best safe place for kids to explore and learn.

They have everything you need to have a wonderful time. We had about 10 children attend between ages 8 months-5 years old and all of them had a wonderful time. The staff were friendly and very helpful and they have lots of decorations already set up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dylan Christiano\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: A fantastic little spot, I am so glad we found it.

He’s absolutely loved it & we will definitely do again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gabrielle Watson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 11 months ago\nReview: I absolutely love WonderLab!! I have always had an enjoyable experience there. It’s always super clean, the staff is always friendly, and the environment is warm and cozy.\nBut I did want to share my experience on 7/22/24. Per usual, we were having a pleasant time, but there was a man there with his grandchild who seemed to be sick. He was constantly blowing his nose every minute… literally! And he was also picking his nose without tissue. He would then go about touching the surfaces and toys that the children were touching and that made me uncomfortable. I did speak with a staff member, and informed her that we would be leaving and not completing our scheduled playtime because of this. She did offer an apology and was very polite. I just wish they could have offered some type of pass to come back another day and get the 30 mins that we lost.  However, this would not discourage me from visiting WonderLab again. I have been numerous times and it has always been amazing.\n\n*Update:\nThe Wonder Lab’s management team did reach out to me via email and helped correct the situation. Wonderful customer service  and a wonderful team!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Bosquet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Our 4yo absolutely LOVED his camp experience “I love my new school, I want to come here everyday!”\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris Heavener\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: When the weather's not cooperative we usually head to Wonderlab. Typically we're looking for something educational and intellectually stimulating, elevated above the noise of an indoor fun park. Kids are welcome to be themselves there. Wonderlab checks all the right boxes. Plus they have free coffee!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maura Rooney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We’ve taken our three kids to play and learn at Wonder Lab, and now our oldest (3) has been attending their summer camp!

It’s amazing how relaxing the experience is for the adults as well as the children. We love the tots class too. Can’t say enough good things about it - it’s saved our sanity on multiple occasions!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abigail R\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely wonderful, incredibly thoughtful space. Perfect for our child’s second birthday. The 1,2,3 and 4 year olds all had so much fun and the parents were able to chat. The quieter room to the side is brilliant - perfect for anyone who needed a few minutes of space. Owner is flexible and super helpful. Thank you so much for a great time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tina Chhabria Gupta\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: What a wonderful space! We hosted our son’s 2nd birthday with 18 families so practically chaos. The owners were very considerate and intentional with every part of their space. I love hosting my toddler and baby friendly party here!\n\nI lost count of the number of times the parents told me, “what a great space.” Or “what a great party.” or “we love this”.\n\nAs the host, I loved that every option and price is available on the website, so no surprises. They allow outside catering, so I decide the food budget. The entire space is yours for a birthday party, so everyone is comfortable. I had the ability to use their tables, tape, existing decor, so I just had to add my unique touches.\n\nHighly recommend for your kiddo’s birthday party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Margie Baylock\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Update: We continue to come here. As the kiddos get older, they enjoy exploring new areas. The staff is always amazing, and I meet a lot of nice moms and nannies.\n\nThis place is amazing! An interactive, clean, and stimulating place to bring the kiddos. My two toddlers had a wonderful time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jacqueline Scott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We are so lucky to have this space in our \"backyard\" of Durham! We have been here for open play sessions, and we go to weekly Tots & Twos classes with our now one year-old daughter. Kate puts such thought into the various theme activities (fall: leaf wind tunnel, felt stick board of acorns/trees/pumpkins; 1 yr birthday anniversary: magnet fishes, light up cube Magne-tiles) and stations, and such care is maintained in keeping a safe, clean, accommodating environment for children and families.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: My 9 month old loved this place! Lots of fun educational activities and felt very safe! Very nice folks who own and work here!

Every toy is thoughtfully chosen and laid out to create a fun and engaging space for little ones to explore! If you need 90 minutes where you can watch your child happily play and relax with a hot cup of coffee, you need the Wonder Lab!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kate Knapp\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Wonderful STEM space for young kids! I love bringing my youngest here (age 1.5) to play when we're looking for a morning activity. It's locally owned by a super sweet couple with two kids of their own. The space is the perfect size to not lose your kids, and they provide free coffee and tea for parents which is an added bonus! They also play relaxing background music and overall it's just always an enjoyable experience. Highly recommend checking it out.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laney Greystone\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hosted a birthday party for our two year old. It was so lovely and perfect for all her friends. The open space made it easy to keep an eye on the kids without having to stay two steps behind them. We brought our own food and the staff was so helpful, friendly, and relaxed. Easiest party I’ve ever planned. 10/10 would recommend\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Annie Franceschi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We are loving Wonder Lab so much!

My one year old and six year old can both easily fill the 90 minute play time. Theres a snack area (byo or buy them there), free coffee and tea for grown ups, clean restrooms, and a quiet room for nursing or just taking a break. Toys are rotated seasonally, so there’s something new to see every time you come, along with the old-familiar things.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adrienne Tegreeny\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We went on a peaceful Sunday afternoon and had a nice time. My four-year-old said he wanted to come back everyday and I loved watching my 11-month-old explore all the toys (thankfully there's designated baskets for \"tasted toys\"). The inside is so pretty; it seriously looks like a luxury playroom you'd find on Instagram.\nIt's pretty much one large area so it was very easy for me to keep an eye on both kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: OMG my new fav place.

The owner is very sweet and kind (even when my toddler is being a chaotic little mad scientist), they offer age appropriate classes for little ones, and the space always looks clean and somehow organized, even with lots of little ones running around. I've had to reschedule classes twice in a row and they've been very accommodating.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elise Shuman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laylo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lanhui Wang\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had a 3rd birthday party for our daughter.

He can freely play with lots of things to catch and hold his attention, then move onto other things that catch and hold his attention. Although he does not do screen time at home, there is an interactive screen at WonderLab that he loves...then onto the next thing :) WonderLab is truly a hidden gem and we hope it stays around for quite awhile!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Real M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Awesome place to take toddlers.

Durham desperately needed a place like the Wonder Lab. We just had our daughter's 2nd birthday party here, and I only have good things to say. It was a perfect environment for the kids (ages 1-3) to explore, be stimulated, and get their energy out. There were so many toys and activities to interact with, and unique items/setups you would not have at home - always a plus! The space felt incredibly clean, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and it was just a very pleasant place to be. We will be back again and again and again! Can't wait to have play dates with our friends here. What a gem - thank you, The Wonder Lab!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: prachi parikh\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s a great place to explore for little ones but I felt like it was better equipped for 6mo-2.5yo and then 5-6yo (robots were cool). There wasn’t much engaging for the “middles”. My 3yo didn’t have too much fun. Something like marbles is more engaging and fun.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tong Guo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I can't say enough good things about this place - extremely clean, very well organized (they have a clearly designed website for you to  reserve a place in advance, both for open play and for parties), thoughtfully curated STEM toys, and very friendly staff. Always had challenges to entertain our 1yo until we found this place! Truly a hidden gem in Durham for kids 6mon-6yrs. Look forward to attending many of their classes as well - they look fun even for adults!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C May Spivey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This space is incredible to bring any age child to. From babes to older kids there’s something for everyone to find an interest in and learn from. Highly recommended.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Broderick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We love this place so much and come here at least once a week! My 1 and 3 year old boys have a blast every time. There’s such a diverse selection of open ended toys and tools activities ranging from gross motor play, to blocks, sensory materials, and so much more. Plus, the owners are so, so sweet, and the environment is cozy and clean. We cannot recommend this place enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anila Ajeesh\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luis David Maya Medina (LD)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Brand new place. Comfortable, safe, fun for the kids. Very smart toys/stations. Visited for free-play, our kids (1,3,4) had a blast.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: T C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Such a cute and inviting play space! Love the open play aspect and looking forward to booking some classes in the future for my little one. We will be back and highly recommend! The robot was fun to play with too!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gabe Roth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: First-ever Google review but had to — my 17-month-old daughter had so much fun here. Wish we had a place like this in Brooklyn.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justin and Danielle Tingley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This is a perfect place to bring little ones! It’s a safe place to explore and tinker with all types of materials and mechanisms. There’s a calm room with a sound machine and noise cancelling ear muffs for any kids that may feel overstimulated. Free coffee and tea for adults and lots of snacks for purchase. I’ve been hoping a place like this would open in Durham. Definitely will be coming back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Hill Carrigan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Wow. Just wow. Exactly what I needed to spend an afternoon with my almost-2 year old after daycare. I will be here much more often. This is exactly what Durham needed. The owners are a married couple with kids who just made what they wish they had when their kids were small. It doesn't get much better than that!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam Watson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is amazing. Super thoughtful play area that works well for my 1 year old and 3 year old. And they are brilliantly open on Sunday mornings! We've loved every moment spent at The Wonder Lab and appreciate the warmth and intent of every aspect (free unlimited coffee/tea, kid snacks for sale, baby/toddler friendly bathroom, exhibits that works for big age ranges). 10/10 recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Naz Akimova\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This is an amazing indoor playground. My kid is 4 y.o. and he was very excited to play and learn. I want to mention that playground was very clean, safe, music was so calming. Also, I liked free coffee and tea options. The staff was very kind and polite. Thank you! We will be coming again)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Scher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had my daughter’s birthday party at The Wonder Lab. It was absolutely perfect. 2 hours of play was just the right amount of time and the activities were great for all attendees ranging from 1-7 years old. The space was large enough to spread out but still maintain visibility on all kids. We will be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yael S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is awesome!!! I'm so tired of having to drive to Cary or Raleigh for a fun place to take my toddler. Even those places have older kids that just barrel over my kid. This place is so calm and well laid out. They've got toddler friendly potty training tools in the bathroom. There's free coffee and tea. The owners are super nice and we even made new friends! I will be returning on a regular basis!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Terry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is so fun! My kids are 3.5 and 1.5, and they had an amazing time. Favorites included the wind tunnel for parachute and scarf launching, a conveyor belt, the climbing tower, and the many smaller toys. Lots of wooden toys and things we don’t own/ friends don’t own. There are lots of books too!  I loved the cozy poufs so I could comfortably supervise from the floor. Free coffee and tea was a win too. We will absolutely be back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Kate Waetjen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We love the Wonder Lab! So excited to have this space in Durham! A group of friends and I took our 11 month olds and there was so much to keep them busy playing! A clean, calm, and inviting atmosphere perfect for young kids! We will absolutely be visiting again soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dana Cataldo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is amazing! The staff was very kind and welcoming. So many inviting and engaging toys for the kids (and adults too😉). Already planning ahead to have my daughters birthday here. This place is a must for child entertainment! …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janelle Mack\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had so much fun here today! The 90 minutes went by so fast as my daughter (almost 2) was busy playing and exploring the entire time. We will be back for sure!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara de Lima\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Such a great place! My toddler loved it! Was engaged and a safe place to play!

Hours are kind of weird as most people don’t even get off of work and home til 6 so seeing later hours throughout the week would be great. Only issue is staff does their closing stuff while customers are still in the building and they shut off the games and machines 20+ minutes before closing. You definitely feel rushed to get out although you paid a decent price per kid for the hours they have posted. If your hours state you are open until 7 allot an extra 30+ minutes to have your staff clean after customers have left the building instead of while they are trying to enjoy the last 30 minutes with their kids. While staff is occupied getting their end of shift list done it leaves the counters unattended. I get it’s a kids place you should be cleaning things all day but cutting the machines off plus running loud machines just makes it feel like “ get out” also with punch card some staff will punch one per kid while others punch one per visit. And when asked about their monthly membership most answers from staff “ I’m not sure you would have to wait and ask our boss one day when she’s here”..\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Garacci\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: We had such an amazing time here with our daughter. She loved it! The prices were surprisingly cheaper than I expected. Friendly staff, clean facility, and such a great idea in general. My daughter is already begging to come back.

We tend to stay for hours at a time and she makes new friends every time and dreads leaving.\n\nSeems like most all indoor play places have closed down these days, and the nearest ones are just expensive arcades or indoor trampoline parks… and you’ll need to drive 45 minutes one way. 👎🏻\n\nThe staff here are friendly, polite, always working, cleaning, sanitizing, always attentive. They seem to only employ good people to work here. They also have good snacks and small simple meals on-hand (chicken tenders, hot dogs, etc), affordable toy vending machines, and high quality coffee!\n\nIt’s a good, secure place to go to relax, get out of the rain, or the heat, or the cold, and let the kids run free. Safely.\n\nIt’s like $15 for all-day admission. You can’t beat it. You can also host children’s Birthday Parties here! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kimberly boggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Kids Play and Cafe is hands-down the best place to bring my two-year-old! It’s the perfect spot for him to run off all that toddler energy in a safe and fun environment. The play area is clean, well-organized, and full of activities that keep him engaged for hours. What I love most is how it helps him build his social skills—he’s constantly interacting with other little ones, learning to share, take turns, and make new friends. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the cafe is a great bonus for parents to relax while still keeping an eye on the kiddos. We’re always excited to come back. Highly recommend for anyone with young children!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pamela Ballard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I took my 20-month granddaughter here today.  This is by far the best toddler indoor play area that we have experienced in the Greenville area.  It is very clean and the play equipment is safe and age-appropriate.  The prices are reasonable and you can leave and return the same day for the one price.  We stayed 4 hours.  I highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carrie Fisher\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Cute place but definitely more of the younger kids crowd than anyone 7+.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mattie Jones\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Nice place to bring you young toddlers.. it's smaller than I anticipated.  coffee is great tho..\nSnacks will break you! My granddaughter had fun however she always has fun and sees the positive side of things..  it took me 45 minutes to get here.. so with no disrespect I will probably not be back.. there is another place closer to home that's cheaper all the way around.. it's a nice place please don't get me wrong.. Go see for yourself like we did.. Decor is very nice for an adult to drink the coffee.. but.. Humm\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Buff\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Friendly owners. Friendly staff.

I would definitely say its not recommended for kids 13+ in my opinion as its mostly little kids and just a park big enough to keep kids under 13 occupied for a good bit. They also have a smaller playground for kids 3 and under which is really nice for anyone bring kids that are really small and big. There are 2 separate ball pits, a little car go round and a few role-playing houses for kids to play with each other. They have a café dedicated to small kids but still good enough for adults to put something small in their stomachs. There is a breastfeeding area in case women want privacy and 2 separate areas for parents to relax while kids play. There are a few machines to win prizes and some from what I can tell are guaranteed wins. There are 2 separate rooms for parties and they seem to have a lot of events going on to keep the fun going and different (like a ms Rachel meet and egg hunt). I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Yea its a little messy from kids playing throughout the day but that's to be expected... they're kids. It gets cleaned up nonetheless.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DeNijah Carter\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: KPC >>> anything else!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kisha Stone\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Me and my daughter just moved back to pickens and found this place.

It is rather smaller than I expected but overall it's a nice facility. They even have snacks and hot food you can purchase. I thought the benches seated around the facility were a great touch for parents while the kiddos hop from one thing to another. We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Darras\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Jen & Keith go above & beyond when it comes to running & owning an amazing kids space! Their whole staff is attentive, friendly, helpful & never disappoints. Whether you’re there for a few hours of fun or hosting a birthday party, our experience has never been short of exceptional. Kids play & cafe is the place to be & stands out from the rest.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Messenger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Best kids play place in upstate SC! The coffee is AMAZING and they have a wide selection of snacks for the littles. It is very clean and I really love how much there is to do for my daughter even though she cannot even walk yet. We have been multiple times and she gets so excited when we walk through the door! There is an older kid section as well so glad we will be able to keep going for many years to come!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Culberson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I absolutely love bringing my kids here, it’s always clean, it’s well taken care of, the staff is friendly and helpful.

This place is truly a gem, especially for families with neurodivergent kids. One of our favorite things about it is how autism-friendly it is—they even provide headphones for kids who need sound support, which was such a thoughtful touch.\n\nThe owner was absolutely amazing, communicating with us every step of the way. Even on the day of the party, she was there to ensure everything ran smoothly and that we had everything we needed. Her dedication and hard work were truly impressive!\n\nThe space was perfect for a fun, stress-free celebration, and we highly recommend it to any family looking for a welcoming and accommodating place for their child’s special day. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beth Meares\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Every time I bring my grandsons, ages two and three, they have a great time. This morning was under age 4 from 10 to noon. Bryli and Kate got us in quickly, made delicious coffees, kept the sanitizer and push broom moving. Grandma tip: buy the Kid Café gripper socks, and put them over your own socks. When it’s time to go, take off the Kid Café socks, and send the kids home with their own clean socks. Wash the cute Café socks for next time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ireland Pfeiffer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I was very impressed by the number of workers on the floor at all times making sure everyone was safe and having fun! More of a Jungle Gym than a cafe, so don’t expect any relaxing music or “chill” vibes.

We make the 45 minute drive to this play cafe once a week. My kids love it and the owners are amazing! This place way cleaner than other cafes I've been to. The place is small enough I can sit and rest knowing if I looked up I'd easily be able to find my kid but large enough that everyone's not on top of each other.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kendra George\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Hall\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kevin Addis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cam Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Amazing and safe place for kids! So thankful we have this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: MamaBear3\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This place is great for the kids to run and play however I do think their small café is a bit pricey considering the items and what I could get elsewhere. Also i do think somone at the desk should watch the gates because a few small kids almost went out due to the gate being left open until a parent or another bystanding parent stopped them.  But with that being said my kids had a great time and we will be back just probably not for the Café.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leigh Agresti\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: So fun for multiple ages!

Kids waiting to play on certain things. It was just a crowded mess.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Holly Brooks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: My kids love this play place the best of all the indoor play places.

After some searching, I stumbled upon this family-owned treasure, and it has been a game-changer for us.\n\nKids Play and Café isn't just a play area; it's a warm, welcoming community. The staff are incredibly friendly and always go the extra mile to make you feel at home. And those Lotus energy drinks? They're simply unbeatable. The café itself offers an exceptional experience every time, with a menu full of delicious options, including vegan and non-dairy choices.\n\nThe events they host each month are another highlight, adding even more excitement to our visits. If my toddlers had their way, they’d move in!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jeremiah Riel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Awesome place for kids to let loose and get their energy out. The cafe is great for snacks for the kids, as well as a caffeine recharge for mom and dad. They have Wi-Fi so you can get some work done while kids play also. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly Gilstrap\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was my first visit to Kids Play Cafe with our 3 year old grandson.

It's so clean, qell organized and there's so much to play with. The staff are constantly cleaning the surfaces, so everything is sanitized.

We truly enjoyed your party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miranda Sofer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This morning, my husband and I found ourselves staring at our two kids, feeling completely stumped on what to do with them. We live in Five Forks and have already checked off the Children's Museum and the Zoo. With the heat making the park a no-go and the age gap between our kids (6 and 2) complicating things, we needed a solution. In a moment of desperation, I googled “Things to do with kids in Greenville, SC” and stumbled upon Kids Play & Cafe in Easley, about 45 minutes away. The photos looked promising, but I wasn’t sure if it would hold their interest for more than five minutes. Still, I decided to give it a try.\n\nSpoiler alert: It’s fantastic!\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, I was impressed. We signed the waiver, paid the $30, and my kids eagerly ran off to explore. The space has plenty of spots to stash shoes and comfortable seating for parents to keep an eye on their little ones. The climbing jungle gym was a huge hit—it was designed perfectly for both my 2-year-old and 6-year-old, with various levels of difficulty. I was relieved to see that there were enough ways for kids to climb up and down without needing any help from the staff. Plus, there are several other areas specifically for toddlers to play safely.\n\nI made sure the kids had a good lunch before we arrived, but the on-site cafe had a great selection of snacks, including organic Annie’s, candy, muffins, cupcakes, and drinks like bottled water, organic juices, and coffee. We enjoyed a cupcake, some Annie’s cheddar crackers, and a coffee while we were there.\n\nThe staff were exceptional—friendly, attentive, and proactive. When my 2-year-old removed his socks, they quickly informed me he needed to get them back on or he'd have to miss out on climbing. Honestly, I appreciated the attention they were paying. Additionally, I noticed staff members constantly cleaning and tidying up, which gave me peace of mind about the cleanliness of the facility. After visiting other indoor play centers, I can confidently say this place surpasses them all.\n\nAn added bonus was the warm atmosphere created by other parents. Everyone seemed genuinely nice, and the kids quickly made friends. One child even helped my 2-year-old into the ball pit. It’s clear that this place fosters a great community.\n\nIf I had one suggestion, it would be to make the arcade games and cotton candy machine card-friendly. I would have easily bled $30-40 into those machines, but I rarely carry cash and didn’t notice an ATM on-site. A token system or card payments could be a great addition, but I understand the challenges with credit card fees for small businesses.\n\nAs for keeping an eye on your kids, you’ll see a range of options. Some parents worked on laptops in centrally located tables, others relaxed on phones in cozy egg-shaped chairs or enjoyed massage chairs, while some simply found comfy spots to sit along the perimeter. I was more active since my youngest is a bit of a daredevil, but overall, it was a relaxing experience that properly exhausted my kids and provided a nice, quiet drive home.\n\nI hope this review helps other parents considering the drive to Easley for a fun and engaging spot for their kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chandler Snider\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey Foster\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This place is the best! I drive all the way from Greenville because it’s just that much better than other similar places. Clean, great seating for parents, cute atmosphere - I genuinely enjoy hanging out here while my kids play\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Autumn Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gladys Sosa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Best indoor play ground in the Upstate.\nI'm a grandma of a 2 year old and this is our favorite place.

I was super impressed with Lily and Natalie! They were nice and helpful with any questions we had or anything we needed. We got coffee and some snacks and really enjoyed our visit. I also watched Natalie clean, straighten up toys mulitple times, and sanitize the ball pit while we were there. Friendly staff, safe environment for my little toddlers, and clean! we will definitely be making this a regular play place for my kiddos! thank you!}",

We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i’m assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it’s too hot outside.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Micah Wolfe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We absolutely love this playground! Our kids loved it even more! (2 1/2 years old and 14 months old) They had a blast and did not want to leave! I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn’t even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend!

The kids were happily engaged in the designated play areas, allowing the adults some well-deserved free time. My one-year-old also had a fantastic time.

The cafe was ready to go and allowed us in a little before the party to get situated with our part (food, cake & treats) and everything was set for guests to arrive and get straight to partying! We had all of our needs met and the kids had an amazing time. The play area is lovely and provides endless play throughout the various areas up and downstairs.

It’s VERY small. My son could have played with dinosaurs and kitchen play set at home. It’s honestly not worth it. I would say it’s good for babies but still small. Also very awkward 😐 we won’t be back. Feel like my son was way to big to be there.

It’s just overall underwhelming.\n$15 per time slot and an additional $5 for each adult.\nA cafe? It is not. There is a Keurig (that didn’t work) and a kettle. The snacks are all prepackaged and probably what you have in your diaper bag.\nThe seating is minimal and EXTREMELY cramped. The entire place is furnished from IKEA at best.\nThe infant area is microscopic and can really only fit one child and one parent.\nThe toys are worn out, stained and just not quality to say the very least.\nThe carpeted steps leading upstairs are stained and dirty…\nMaybe we are spoiled by similar concepts but this place is just not it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sara kraft\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: I am a nanny and this playhouse is by far my absolute favorite place to take my nanny kiddos. The environment is amazing for littles. Some places can be too crowded and overwhelming for my kiddos and this place is a little smaller and has two separate play rooms that make it nicer and more fun. They also change up the playroom themes to keep it exciting. They have lots of fun character parties you can sign up for. We have done Elsa, Ana and Rapunzel which were a blast. 100% recommend brining your kiddos here!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey Griffin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Best place in South Charlotte/ Fort Mill area for kiddos 1-6 years old.

Overall great experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashlee Chapman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: My son had a great birthday! This place was awesome. The kids can run around without the parents having to chase around after them and it was super clean. I would recommend highly for birthday parties or for playtime!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joyce McGrail\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My boys and I enjoy coming here! We usually stay the entire 2 hours and they get a little snack afterwards by the front (very convenient). The playhouse is reasonably priced which I’m thankful for because I have two young boys.\nThe receptionist is always friendly and willing to answer questions you may have. I love how they have different themes, it gives us a reason to come back to check it out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivana Radonjic\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Visited today for the first time with my almost 2 year old son and had a blast. We were welcomed by a friendly lady upon entry and checked in fairly fast even though we didn’t have a reservation. My son loved this playhouse and easily spent two hours here. We’ll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Beth Pulver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The CUTEST place! Such a better deal than any other play place we go to with two hours of playtime compared to the usual one hour at the same rate or less! My little girls have to be dragged out after two hours and my big kids wish they were still small to play as well 🥰 Great environment and I appreciate the smaller capacity so it doesn’t feel completely overstimulating like some places. Also, I love that they have both a well done play structure for gross motor, but they also have several playrooms like a fully stocked kitchen and dress up room for more quiet, imaginative or fine motor. The layout is such that I can actually sit down and watch them play which isn’t true for any other place we go. I brought a group of four other moms a few weeks ago and every single one of them raved about it. Also great that it’s for kids six and under so the little ones aren’t getting run over. My big kids played with the stash of board games while the littles played. Total win for everyone! They have a ton of themed events too like meet Bluey, princess parties, camps and birthday parties are another affordable and generous offering. Have fun there!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joy Pulver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So cute! Love this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Annie Bucy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My two little toddlers and I discovered Play House a couple months ago and we have throughly enjoyed visiting. Play House is clean, creatively decorated and stocked with interactive toys. It's perfect for kids under 6, with a jungle gym, a mini market area and an upstairs. They offer coffee and a sitting area for parents. They have snacks for purchase and the staff is always so friendly. My kids especially adore the ball pit and never want to leave. Such a cute space!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Lindsay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I took my daughter to the Bluey play date today and she had an absolute blast! My favorite moment was when my daughter started twirling around in her dress and Bluey started twirling around next to her. I love how Playhouse is only for kids 6 and under, and that there is only a a small amount of kids (I think around 15) allowed to play for those two hour time slots. Definitely makes it feel less overwhelming. I also love that if you book a birthday party, only your kid’s friends will be there, and not a ton of other kids too. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Catherine Filpo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had my little one birthday party here and the experience was AMAZING!!!

I have taken both my kids multiple times and even had my son’s birthday party there earlier this year and plan on having my daughter’s as well. Shout out to Morgan who was the best planner! She was kind, friendly, and willing to help in any capacity. Parents FYI having Play House set up and decorate for the party is worth it 10x over. I actually got to enjoy my son’s birthday, instead of being a ball of stress, and those moments are priceless. We also frequent Play House during summer/winter breaks to break up the monotony of our days. The staff are always friendly and welcoming and I love that they rotate the themes so it’s different every time we visit.\n\nPs. My vote is to replace the baby area with a rock wall!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa Eckenrode\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We are obsessed with Playhouse cafe! Anytime they have a character event we always bring our girls because they are obsessed.

We highly recommend bringing your kids here to visit!!! ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrea Frisk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Wow, what an amazing birthday experience at PlayHouse Play Cafe! We had the best time celebrating my little one's special day here. Leslie went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. The play area was clean and well-maintained. The kids had a blast playing and exploring, and the adults had a great time relaxing and socializing. The birthday party package was a hit - we will return for sure! Leslie's exceptional service and attention to detail made the day truly special. We can't wait to come back and play again! 5 stars isn't enough - we'd give it 10 stars if we could!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamie Kopczynski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just had a birthday party for my 3yo daughter today at 10 and it was awesome!! They were so helpful, it was such a nice setting for having 15 toddlers because of the enclosed space and lots of different areas to play in. The play structure alone was more than enough, but then there was the cute dress up area, the upstairs area and even the baby area was entertaining for them. Truly a great experience!! Highly recommend them for a party for a kid at or around 3-5 yr old!!\n\nNote, I brought my own food/decorations, but can 100% see the benefit of doing the next tier up party option and make it totally easy. Plenty of room for adults and kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dee Anna\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: I’ve taken my kids a few times and they love it!

It is reasonably priced and the kids were very entertained. I do not believe that the toys are sanitized daily after closing or before opening. We were also rushed out by the front desk woman. At around 12 she walked up to me and stated she smelled number 2 and asked if one of my littles needed a diaper change. Being that I was not even a foot away from either I knew they didn’t need a diaper change because I would’ve smelled it being I am a lot closer to them than she was. I let my littles play for 15 minutes longer and she began taking out the trash and starting her closing duties. At 12:15  I packed us up so we could grab  lunch locally before their  nap time and she immediately locked the door behind us. I’m sure she tried to suggest a diaper change to get us to leave quicker so she could get off earlier.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: LaQuan Robinson\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Static Gaming\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The playhouse cafe was a nice venue for my kid birthday party although the staff member was rude from the moment we arrived and continued to tell us our time we have to leave which was annoying, we booked an extra hour for setup and to make sure we were going to be out at a timely matter. She also yelled at my guest when we were trying to help clean up before we left and yelled “just get out” I’m extremely disappointed on how my guest and I was treated. This will be my last time booking at playhouse cafe.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Baker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I cannot say enough good things about my experience here with one year old’s birthday party! It’s perfect for a smaller party! Staff patiently and kindly answered all of my questions before the party and had everything beautifully set up when I got there! I didn’t even need to bring my own decorations. I was struggling to get a couple of things set up, and they jumped right in and helped me. They were SO nice, and the space was so clean and well-presented. Will definitely book a party here again!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marino F .

He is usually too small for play structures like this but this one was perfect.\nWe played kitchen, dress up, trains, ball pit, climbing and sliding.\nMy 6 month old enjoyed the Baby Area for under 18 months with their own little ball pit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Viniconis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had our daughter’s 4th birthday party at Play House last weekend and she is still talking about it! We’ve been here a number of times for play sessions and knew it would be a perfect party spot as well. It’s especially great for older toddlers and preschoolers who want to practice their independence, because the entire play structure is visible to onlooking adults and it’s bright inside the building. We’ve been to parties at much larger play places and it can be a little nerve wracking if you have very small kids. We had 12 little ones (about 30 people total) at the party and it wasn’t overwhelming. I really appreciate that parties are a private session for your group! The upstairs is also adorable, and they’ve added some new sensory toys along with dress up outfits and a reading nook. We are so happy that Play House is now open - the concept is just what we needed an as option for young kids in this area. Kind owners and staff, clean environment, complimentary coffee for adults, safe space for littles to play. I’ve been recommending it to everyone!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Lipsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had my sons 3rd birthday party here and it was amazing.

Very friendly staff and we always love to support a small business! We loved that they placed soft music in the background while the kids play. It's smaller than I expected, but it's a very cozy, cute place.

The play area is designed in such a way that I can allow my older one to play independently in the play structure while siting with my infant. I can still keep an eye on her because even though it’s three stories tall but only 2 rows deep. So it’s very easy to view your children while they play while also having plenty of play area. They also cap the number of kids allowed per play session which I love because I don’t have to worry about it being too crowded for my kids when I come :) I definitely would recommend this indoor playground over others in the area especially for moms of younger children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ben and Jackie Nutsch\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I have been here 3 times during opening hours according the GOOGLE and they are never open.

I get that the place is small, but I have a 4 yr old and twin 2 year olds. It’s not safe to walk them through parking lots by myself. The girl working was very inflexible about it, and wouldn’t let me fold the stroller and tuck it out out of the way. She did let another twin mom keep her stroller inside for her babies though. Won’t be coming back. It’s too much of a hassle.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah E\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a blast here! My 4 and 2 year old loved it.

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.

She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Briana Willett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jevon Brun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My sons love Funky Frogz!

Everyone there is very friendly as well!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Caro Méndez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We had a amazing time!!!!!\nOur 13 months old totally loved the playground.\nThe owner and her daughter are great, kind and respectful. Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.\nThe space is clean and it’s got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.\nSo thankful we found this place.\nWe will be back 💙\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie marie\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here. Lots of things for toddlers and kids to do. Will definitely come back soon 😁 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sharisma Covington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I decided to bring my boys for the first time. Was looking for something indoors to do since it was so hot today. They both had so much fun and did not want to leave. Their favorite thing was the dinosaur room and the playground. Atmosphere was relaxing was not crowded today. I like that i can bring my own food for them they do have a cafe there as well. 10/10 recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica McLeod\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hands down the best spot for indoor play that I have been to for my 2 year old and 6 year old.  My kiddos did not want to leave.  Pleasant atmosphere, clean,  inviting, safe and comfortable.

Do you have babies and/or toddlers and need somewhere indoors, out of the elements for them to play? And you’d love to sit and drink coffee while they play? This is place for you! You can get snacks here or you can bring your own as long as they are no nut products. The bathrooms even have diapers and a Change of clothes if needed! We’re so excited about it. You sign your waiver, take off your shoes, and play. Adding it to my schedule of events for the month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Tolliver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super fun! Great relaxing place to let your kid(s) run around without having to tell them no every 5 min. It’s a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.\n\nSaturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.\n\nI wish there were more gates around doors here though, I’ve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darien Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebastian M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners, the play sets, the crowd, the snack options are really nice and all for a reasonable price.\nI will definitley recomend and come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morar Daniela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Lovely, amazing, super clean place with helpful staff and reasonable prices.\nI’ll be looking to get some sort of membership, my 4yo loves it! 🩵🩵🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impressions are that this place is good fun for the littles. We brought our 11 MO and she had a blast running around exploring all the toys and stuff. As well as seeing and watching other kids doing what they were doing too.\n\nWe might be visiting more often :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicki Kennington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was my first time visiting here. I love the variety of toys and playhouses they have. My 11 mo granddaughter had a great time playing and exploring. I will definitely bring her back.\nMy only criticism is that the music is a bit louder than it needs to be. The volume mixed with kids playing and yelling is a bit much. Also, maybe play children’s songs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jinnow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Ryan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Delmazeo Sanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ari S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place for my toddler! Hands down the best find we have found for him to come play at. We make a 45 mins drive to come here because of how great it is. Staff is very nice, place is kept clean and organized. Other kids and parents have always been polite too and the play areas have stuff for all different ages to enjoy including for the parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liana Regan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son (3.5) has a blast here!   They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place! Happened upon it on a rainy day and it's perfect for my 1 year old!  Thanks to the Floridan family for making sanford your home! We will be back!!\n\nWe come here primarily because it is a Christian-based, young child friendly space with relaxed atmosphere. We appreciate this safe-space for our family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Claus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I come here with my kids all the time. It's big and has plenty of stuff for kids to do, and situated between a coffee place and food store - so it's easy to grab a snack or drink!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Cameron (Kim)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My child loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Beam\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.\n\nWe arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it! If it was a bit more cost effective we would come multiple times a week!! The space snd imaginative play are what my kids thrive on!

Nice relaxing environment. I love that there is a separate little dining area. We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business. My daughter is 3.5 yrs. old. She had as much fun playing at Funky Frogz today as she had ever had anywhere else!

My children ages 1 and 4 could stay here all day . There is so much to do , it's great for short attention spans . There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

Went with our little one today and she had an absolute blast. There are so many different play areas that kids of all ages can enjoy.

They have snacks to purchase if you aren't having a \"Pinterest parent\" organized sort of day. I was able to sip on a cold brew while they wore themselves out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ed Quigley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great indoor play space. Clean, bright, lots of activities.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Vaughan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Funky Frogz is exactly what Sanford needed for kids! A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

There’s also a baby play area and yummy snacks! Also there is NO CONS except the distance from me but it’s worth it 100%\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shannon Hill\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: I love this place.

It’s been incredible for me and both of my kids both developmentally allowing them to explore things they can’t at home, and by making so many new friends I never would have met otherwise! The membership is so worth it if you live close by, we’re here several times a week. They have fun events like a firefighter themed day where a fire truck and firemen came to give a presentation and let the kids get pictures, as well as scavenger hunts, crafts, sensory play, and so so much more.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out, even just for the delicious coffee 😋😋\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rickie Twiford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: My wife & daughters go to Jungle Jamz frequently.

Core memory for us parents made as my nearly 2 year old gave Bluey a fist bump.\nBluey came out for a dance, then each child got their own individual photo opportunity. Bluey then came into the play area one more time before she had to go.\n\nThey have a really good selection of toys and play equipment for a variety of ages. All the toys are also well maintained. The staff are also very friendly.\n\nWhen we went all the parents were kind and understanding as well. (Which also seems to be a core philosophy here too.)\n\nWe made a 55 minute drive (due to traffic) and will be coming again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Fischer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Jungle Jamz is our go-to spot! We are so lucky to have them here! We’ve been coming since they opened and always have the best time. Meghan is such a connector and cares about creating a nurturing place for kids and their caregivers! We just celebrated our daughter’s 1st birthday here as well - the party was beautiful, fun, and so low stress for us! Thank you, thank you Meghan and Antonio for bringing this wonderful space to our community!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alisia Keeling\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: My little and I definitely love this place. It is always kept clean. It is also a safe and fun place for kids to enjoy themselves and connect with others. Not to mention, the deliciously affordable drinks and snacks. We look forward to returning and will recommend to others!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Martha Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: 1st trip!  It won't be our last.

Meghan and her team made everything smooth for me. I hate planning events. I fully trusted Meghan and her team and they exceeded my expectations. I would definitely book again.

We just don't really like the Christian music. 4 stars\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kyle Donnelly\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: A great little spot to take your little ones!  They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.\nThey have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Lafountain\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: While visiting from out of town we needed a place to play while it rained. Funky Frogs was the place that delivered. Would highly suggest to anyone looking for an indoor play place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley McKinney\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Briana Willett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jevon Brun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My sons love Funky Frogz!

Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.\nThe space is clean and it’s got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.\nSo thankful we found this place.\nWe will be back 💙\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie marie\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

Was looking for something indoors to do since it was so hot today. They both had so much fun and did not want to leave. Their favorite thing was the dinosaur room and the playground. Atmosphere was relaxing was not crowded today. I like that i can bring my own food for them they do have a cafe there as well. 10/10 recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica McLeod\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hands down the best spot for indoor play that I have been to for my 2 year old and 6 year old.

Do you have babies and/or toddlers and need somewhere indoors, out of the elements for them to play? And you’d love to sit and drink coffee while they play? This is place for you! You can get snacks here or you can bring your own as long as they are no nut products. The bathrooms even have diapers and a Change of clothes if needed! We’re so excited about it. You sign your waiver, take off your shoes, and play. Adding it to my schedule of events for the month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Tolliver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super fun! Great relaxing place to let your kid(s) run around without having to tell them no every 5 min. It’s a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.\n\nSaturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.\n\nI wish there were more gates around doors here though, I’ve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darien Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebastian M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners, the play sets, the crowd, the snack options are really nice and all for a reasonable price.\nI will definitley recomend and come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morar Daniela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Lovely, amazing, super clean place with helpful staff and reasonable prices.\nI’ll be looking to get some sort of membership, my 4yo loves it! 🩵🩵🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impressions are that this place is good fun for the littles.

I love the variety of toys and playhouses they have. My 11 mo granddaughter had a great time playing and exploring. I will definitely bring her back.\nMy only criticism is that the music is a bit louder than it needs to be. The volume mixed with kids playing and yelling is a bit much. Also, maybe play children’s songs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jinnow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Ryan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Delmazeo Sanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ari S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place for my toddler!

They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place! Happened upon it on a rainy day and it's perfect for my 1 year old!  Thanks to the Floridan family for making sanford your home!

We appreciate this safe-space for our family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Claus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I come here with my kids all the time. It's big and has plenty of stuff for kids to do, and situated between a coffee place and food store - so it's easy to grab a snack or drink!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Cameron (Kim)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My child loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Beam\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.\n\nWe arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it!

Nice relaxing environment. I love that there is a separate little dining area. We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business.

There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

I wish the toddler area had more for more developed toddlers who are ready for the general area but not ready for the bigger kids or don’t meet height requirements. Not sure if they do this but I suggest offering designated sensory play times so children can explore with less restrictions and potential chaos. However, the service was great. I actually really enjoyed the cheese pizza more than I’d like to admit. We got a membership for my son so we’ll be frequenting.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yomara Guzman\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: To me not worth my drive ..place was hot...I wont be going back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsley cattrell\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bea Samsung\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Just to let you know that your reviews are hurting your business.

We went today to give the kids a place to play out of the heat, humidity, and sun. I was sweating just sitting at a table, and I am in good shape. The play area was a bit cooler, but all three kids were covered in sweat, back at the table, and ready to leave after 20 minutes. They normally spend 2 hours there. I won't lie, I was glad they asked to leave as I was about to suggest it myself. Go hydrated and prepare to be uncomfortable. As an HVAC tech, I want to go back with my infrared thermometer to gauge the outputs.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alyssa Ann Swain\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Went today and it felt like a oven what a shame they have all these kids playing and barely any AC save your money\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Colleen Muma\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rome Calicdan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Dirty.

The rest of the facility was clean and smelled fine. Staff was helpful and friendly. The pizza was actually not bad. The mac n cheese bites were good. The fruit tray was fine. The soda was like generic orange and fruit punch, but it was edible. Party room is the best deal, the rooms are quiet with good AC. The common areas were really warm and really loud. The arcade is pricey, as most are. The play area is in good working condition. Anyway, would recommend for a party. For regular play eh, too loud to have good conversation with friends if you're just in the common areas. For a party you can bring your own streamers, balloons, decor and cupcakes. Funville provides ice cream cups and pizza, etc.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Proctor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing staff, clean restrooms, decent food too.

We just repaid for our membership for 3 children, $150 per kid-to find out literally NOTHING in the ball pit area works, balls are disgusting, cords exposed, tiles not covering everything. Let’s not mention the disgusting amount of trash we saw as we got there at 10am right when they opened today. This place Is a complete hazard right now. The mats are all disgusting… the worst I’ve ever seen. Trash and food particles throughout the playground. Lots of areas broken(ring area has ropes about to break any moment. Some other moms in the area mentioned a kid throwing up recently from the second level and employees not even shutting down the building to completely sanitize- kids were walking through throw up tracking it everywhere. No wonder we all got so sick after our last visit. You are charging people full price for a facility that half works.   You should be providing a safe environment for children to play. This is far from that. Gross you should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan Drouin\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: You look at the website and it sells a very pretty picture. Massive playground including ball area with air cannons and all kinds of little air pressure operated tubes to send the balls through. None of them work. They show a really cool looking ropes course all included in the price. Except apparently there is one employee who can open the course and she’s not coming in today so it’s closed. I’m sorry, what? The arcade is about 50% the little crane machines we all know are rigged and the low payout ticket games. They sell the cards showing you such a great discount! Except they don’t tell you that the games are insanely priced so your money doesn’t stretch far enough to make it worth it. The play area is dirty and a lot of the foam tiles leave gaps or are popping up. The levels of straps that you see in the pictures is broken and they have just cardboard over the entrances to a potential fall hazard. If a baby gate isn’t stopping a toddler (never stopped mine at least) what is cardboard doing especially with a 5-6 year old? Because you can’t go up with them or even really see some of the back parts grownups stay on the floor. I’m not rating the food because I’m not paying for what I see other people eating. The pizza looks worse than chuck-e cheese. Overall if you want to pay $30 +the price for socks + arcade cards + over priced frozen pizza, at least do it where they care more about hygiene and safety. This is literally my first review I’ve ever posted anywhere for a bit of scope on how appalled I was.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Donald Rogers\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: This place is NASTY\n- Trash everywhere\n- Old Nasty Mats\n- BROKEN EVERYTHING\n\n- have tried multiple times to get in touch with the owner or even find out who is running this place to no avail.

This was incredibly frustrating for our family. We had to drive back at 3 PM instead since I already bought the tickets online. Pictures below.\n\nOnce inside, the cleanliness was another issue. The kids' clothes ended up dirty because the area was not well maintained.\n\nWith the high cost, incorrect hours, and lack of cleanliness, there are definitely better options out there for a family outing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: SHAUT MON\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raven Meiggs\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Overall a good experience,but I think you should be allowed to watch over your children a bit more, other kids can knock them down and you won't even know.

My husband travels for work and my daughter and i often travel with him. Our favorite thing to do is explore indoor playgrounds when in a new area. All this to say, I’ve been to A LOT of indoor playgrounds.\n2. I only leave reviews publicly when a place is extraordinary or extraordinarily bad. I’m writing this one publicly in hopes of saving another family money and time.\n\nHands down, the worst indoor playground I’ve ever experienced.\n\nFirstly, the front desk employee was sitting in a corner on her phone when we walked in. She looked up and saw us and carried on with what she was doing. After about two minutes of this she begrudgingly walked over and the greeting we were given was: “you do know we close at 8 right?” not even a hello. To which I replied, “yes.” It was 6pm so I understood the attempt to make sure I was informed, but that wasn’t the intent as she followed with: “we WILL close at 8pm, the lights will be cut off at 8:20 and you still have to pay full price.” Trying to stay positive I said “i understand, it’s no problem.” She made it very clear that she did not want to be there and that she did not want us there. I’ve never had a more miserable encounter. She talked so fast and low that I could barley understand anything she said and when I asked her to repeat, she made no adjustment, rather pointed to something that explained what she said or repeated it the same.\n\nIt cost just my daughter and I $40 to play. We’ve been to some incredibly nice indoor playgrounds, some in expensive locations, but this is the most I have ever paid, by far. My daughter is three and very chill, so she’s right on the cusp of wanting to be in the toddler area and wanting to explore the “big kid” area. So, you can pay $15 for your kid to play in the toddler zone, which is a tiny area more targeted for babies or $25 for everything. “Everything” being the toddler area and “big kid” play area; not the arcade, ropes course or the slides. Which the ropes course area and fun slides weren’t even opened. I know all of this because I asked and instead of talking me through it she pointed to a sign I could read. So it was $25 for my toddler, $2 for me to be with her and $10 for both of us a pair of socks. We brought our own grip socks, as we do this a lot, but it was “mandatory” that we each have $5 funville socks. I have NEVER been required to buy socks if I brought our own. After I paid this, I was reminded again of the closing time and sent on my way with no further instruction. I had to ask “is that everything” because she was so vague and unbothered.\n\nI didn’t see anything being cleaned until 7pm, when they started closing. Yes, closing down so heavily that I had to find another employee (the only other employee I saw) to make sure they closed at 8pm (even though I had been told this several times.) There is ball section in the big kid area that allows kids to press buttons that cut on air and do fun things. It was very neat and my daughter LOVED this part, however only TWO out of the 8-10 machines they had actually worked. They also have air guns that you can shoot the balls out of, probably 15, none of them worked. At 7pm with NO warning, they shut all the air off. In the middle of my daughter and I playing the air suddenly cuts off and the employee that “greeted” us came in with a bag and started rounding them up. It took me a second to figure out what was going on it was so abrupt. They were pretty much pushing us out of the door at 7pm. We left at 7:38pm (not the last to leave, still several kids playing) and it felt like we were about to get the lights cut out on us. They actually made an announcement stating that lights cut off at 8:20.\n\nAll in all, it just felt like a huge scam. Half of the attractions were shut down, others closed an hour early, being required to wear funville socks, shutting down at 7, it was all too much. A few of those things I can handle, but all of that and for $40?! I would not recommend this place to anyone. Please do not waste your money here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: brittany morris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Love this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: stewboy1987\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: My family and I had a blast here!!!

You cannot use household socks. You are required to buy funville approved socks. Typically $32.00 each child plus socks adds up! Tuesday is $12.00 + socks\nYou also have the option of a membership and you can load money on their card for the arcade area. The bumper cars have been removed and are no longer offered.\nThere is a decent menu with plenty fried foods,  you can scan a QR that has your table number already this makes ordering really fast. We went with the loaded fries, they came out piping hot. They were actually Pretty good.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Youness H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This place has a lot of potential due to the size and sections but it is very bad managed. We visited this place for 6+ times while paying around 100$ for 3 kids to play 1 to 2 hours. During our visits we thought that the rope coarse was broken or out of service because no one ever was using it. However we visited this week and my kids saw the place is open went on the line to only get denied access to it  because the worker is not welling to do more than one round a day. The employee opens the coarse when she feels like it and does one round ( 5 kids only) per day. Even if everyone payed the same amount to enter and even if our admission ticket is including this section, we were denied to play just because the employee is not feeling like it. This is not fair for us ( parents that paid) for the kids (why the employee only allowed some), and for the employee that is not qualified to do the job. Very disappointed at this establishment and I won’t go back again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natyia Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Catherine Basiga\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This playground is huge.

It is located by the old Chesapeake mall.  There is a burger restaurant in the same parking lot.  They do serve food though.  I saw people eating pizza fries and soda.  There is a QR code on each table you can order from.  This is a great indoor play area. Many levels of fun for kids of all ages. The colors were bright and vibrant and fun at the same time. The play area for toddlers was large and well thought out with many safe things to keep kids busy. It was for kids under 3 foot tall.  My son loved it. A multi level play area for kids older than toddlers maybe up to pre teens.  More than enough physical activities to keep your kids busy for a few hours.  You need a power card type thing to play at the arcade though but modern and fun.  Staff was polite from the time we entered until we left.  The front desk clerk was understanding of my son’s disability and allowed me to wear an entrance band on my wrist instead of him.  The lady that was in the play area with the kids was very attentive to the entire play area.  There was also a lady in charge of the large slides and she was kind to my son who ran over several times but was then scared to do the slide.  We drove 50 minutes to check it out and were glad we did. My son loves it here. I’m sure we’ll be back soon.  This is a good place for a rainy day afternoon.  The only thing I didn’t like was the price.  We paid $40 for my son and husband to each get a pair of socks and to have free play for 2 hours.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Miles\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Overall, this place is poorly managed and short staffed. Kudos to the workers for doing their best with what they had (all were kind).  As others have stated, the place needs to be thoroughly cleaned, as well as maintained.  Unfortunately, we won’t be returning due the issues stated above.  This business has great potential if it were managed properly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberley Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Nice indoor play space for kids of all ages+\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Rabbit\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Your toddler will be kicked out of the toddler section and forced to play in the section for older kids if they're slightly taller than other toddlers. The workers here don't care if your toddler is the right age to play in the toddler section. They would rather your child get trampled by older children. We got a refund and left. We've never been back to this location ever since. That was our first and last time there. Horrible birthday experience for my little one.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: V P\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Fun places for the kids, plenty of space to sit   The kids have a wealth of things to do.

I mean for the amount you are charging I’m expecting continuous cleaning and keeping up with this place .there was fake nails on the floor ! The mats are black and the dust is everywhere !

It's definitely getting used as a lot of equipment is torn, broken, or inoperable. My three year old likes the foam ball area in the back, but only one of the vacuum/blower machines works out of six. My five year old  doesn't seem to mind as she's just having fun running with the other kids.  I've gone 10 times now, but I haven't had any food, but I was told it is as good as you would get from any pizza chain spot serving pizza and wings.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diane Elder\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It used to be reasonable priced, but no longer. I paid $32 for my grandson to play for one hour. That didn't even give him access to the entire playground. He only stayed that long because I kept encouraging him to stay. The one area that he always spends the most time in was not working.  He loves playing with the tennis balls and the air jets. Only one was working. By the way, your socks are not acceptable.  Anyone wanting to enter the play area needs to buy socks even those just trying to supervise their children,  which I suggest you do because they are not liable for anything.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natashia Stewart\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DENNIS “DEEZY” GRANT II\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley *\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely filthy. They made us buy Funville socks for kids and adults going in the activity section, but then let parents with flip flops and timberlands (boots!) in the same section. These parents walked by numerous attendants. There are *large* black dirt spots all over the foam and when questioned, the attendants just said they clean up and anything like this is just from today. Um, what?! There’s no way that’s from one day- even with letting adults take their nasty shoes in the foam that kids are rolling all over. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nTwo stars bc kiddo genuinely liked running around it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: [NRG]basic\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My little brother got slammed against the ground and kicked by a 13y old\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matthias Smith\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our son loves this place and we go a couple times a year knowing the food,drink, and arcade are extra and at captive audience prices and more expensive. However on April 8th 2024 they implemented a policy that all children must have there socks even though we provided our own grip socks. these socks are $5 per pair. Furthermore adults must also purchase them to enter the play area and that is to only be on the ground floor. So while it’s fun for the kids. The pricing and gouging has become crazy and we will no patronize this company.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natanya McConnell\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: HOURS ARE WRONG!

However the last few times we have been in the place has been dirty. The bathrooms were dirty, not stocked and needed trash taken out. The floors need a really good sweeping and mopping. The tables look like they haven’t been wiped down in weeks. Some of the bouncy toys are so filthy that I don’t even think a power wash could save them at this point. It’s unfortunate that the staff doesn’t seem to care. The person at the desk is just eating snacks and watching videos on their phone and always seems annoyed when people come in or ask questions. The way the building is designed you could easily get up and go clean and still be able to see guest walk in. It would be nice to see staff cleaning and wiping down toys periodically especially during cold season. It’s unfortunate that it’s gone down hill.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanni Hobbins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: The adults had more fun than the kids.

As soon as you walk in, you’re greeted with a clean, vibrant space filled with a variety of activities for kids to enjoy. There are climbing structures, slides, and even a soft play area for toddlers, ensuring that children of all ages have something to do.\n\nOne of the best aspects of Kid Zone is how well-organized and well-maintained the facility is. You can tell that cleanliness is a priority, which gives parents peace of mind as their children explore and play. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure everyone has a good experience while keeping the environment safe.\n\nThere are seating areas for parents, and they offer beverages to purchase, so you can relax while your kids burn off some energy.\n\nOverall, Kid Zone is a fantastic place for kids to run, and play in a controlled and fun environment. It’s a great option for birthday parties or just to get out of the house on a rainy day. Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the Powell area!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Knott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Booked a party here super last minute.

But unfortunately, it was not very clean. I wish I had read reviews before going because I now see quite a few others saying the same. There was trash in and around the play area and we were the first and only ones there so I know the trash had been there a while. The play area itself was cool, but not really for my 3 year old. He was not tall enough to climb some of the structures on his own and I was uncomfortable putting my 7 month old on the floor to help him with it being so dirty. The 3 and under area would have been great but a lot of the toys were broken and, again, just very dirty. We may come back when my kids are older, but honestly I’m not even sure about that. I can overlook a lot of things but the overall dirtiness of the entire place was frustrating. Especially since kids are climbing and crawling around. My 3 year olds socks were black on bottom when we left from how dirty it was. Unacceptable.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D.L.

It’s just a great concept in general. However, I will say the entire place was dirty. Stuff was under the picnic tables, clearly wasn’t slept from the night before. The play centers needed wiping down and for context, we were the FIRST ones in there when it opened. The obnoxious kidz bop was blaring at 9 am. It was freezing, at 67 degrees on the thermostat. Inside the climbing area needed to be wiped down as well. The farm animals could use a power wash, so could the mats surrounding the gym equipment. Random socks under the equipment. The wooden play screw washers for the table in the little town are huge choking hazards for 3 and under, surprisingly in the 3 and under section. If a place isn’t being cleaned down, it’s not being sanitized and kids places need sanitizing. Again, cool place, just needs improvement.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kenneth Callaghan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Della Newman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place to bring your little kids.

Toys are incomplete and dirty.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jenaé Anderson Easterly\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had my son’s 3rd birthday party here and all the kids had the time of their life! Great for all toddlers and even smaller babies/ toddlers. Set up  and clean up was super easy. Lil Caesar delivered right to the door. Can’t say enough positive things about this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anon Ymous\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It's a nice way for my child to get exercise since it's still too cold for the outdoor playground. The place is nice enough and my child has a fun time. It's overpriced in my opinion unless you get a membership.\n\nThe only irritating part about it is that there is a little boy whose mom works behind the counter, and he can be problematic sometimes. God knows that little kids can be difficult enough without having to man the front desk while trying to keep an eye on them. That being said, my kid has been attacked by this little boy several times since we started going there and will come home with scratch marks and red skin. He also causes issues with other customers' children as well - taking their toys and being disruptive/loud.\n\nThis won't stop us from coming back indefinitely, but just something to keep in mind if you have smaller children. I won't let them play together unless I'm able to sit right next to my kid to make sure he's not being hurt.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Martín Zambrana\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zachary Thornton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Friendly staff and a great area for kids to play freely. I went for a birthday party and the kids were busy with the play structures and the 4 play house rooms. They really kept the kids so busy parents were able to talk and relax. The play house rooms (barn, kitchen, store, garage) could fit 3 or 4 kids each and provide room for imagination to take over. The play structure had 2 or 3 levels with slides of multiple heights, the kids enjoyed the slides with 4 side by side and raced down to the bottom only to get back in line and challenge another group. Great experience and just off Clinton highway make the location convenient.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Today was the first day my son and I visited Kid Zone. We LOVED it! We heard from others in local community how awesome it is (especially for 3 year olds). This is a place we have been needing for a while in our area. I am not sure what Rebecca Sweet from WBIR is referring to in her review about Kid Zone, (from her other reviews and how she interacts with others, it appears she is hard to please 🙄), but when we went the area was nice, clean, and worth every minute of it. So, unless you want your children playing in a bubble and not be kids, I recommend this place (as a realistic mom)! We will be back and thank you! I didn’t take many pics because we were having too much fun! 😄\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beverly H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It's more for kids 5 and under.  It's really nice for smaller kids but kids 8 and above it's not good.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Sweet\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Heard great things about this place but it wasn’t very clean when we got there. Multiple band aids on the floor and looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a while. The heater was also going on full blast and our kids were complaining about how hot it was…the adults thought it was really warm too. Hate to say but we probably won’t go back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Eliseth Blanco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellie Atton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Beard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a birthday party here and loved it!

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy. Tons to do for everyone and accommodates all group ages from babies to teens!

Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog. Very impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yesica Robles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great place for kids !

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

We would like to see it open Monday and Tuesday even if it's open later in the day , if weekdays could be open later till at least 7:00 that would be awesome so families that get off of work at 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. can still stop by there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nate Eller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great place with very friendly staff!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reymundo Fierro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great place for young kids parties.

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

I actually brought her a week before the party just to check the place out and talk to someone about our upcoming reservation. Eddie was the one who helped me, and he was amazing, super helpful, knowledgeable, and professional. He even followed up with me twice before the party, which really impressed me.\n\nOn the day of the party, Eddie was off, but two lovely ladies took care of us. They did a fantastic job and were very attentive. The place itself is clean, fun, and the staff overall is friendly and welcoming.\n\nMy daughter had an amazing time, and so did all the other kids. We’ll definitely be back!

The staff is very nice, explained everything well. We came at 12:30 and it was very calm, maybe four families with their kids. They have clear bins and totes to hold your belongings together like your shoes as shoes aren’t allowed once inside the play area but they have plenty of tables and chairs in front and around the play area to see your kids playing. Lockers are available as well. The entry to the play area is locked and only staff can let people in and out which I love so kids can’t run out. We have been to other types of play places similar to this but they didn’t have the area secured like they do here so kids easily went to the front door. Everything is very clean and organized nicely. The music playing is kidz bop so kid friendly and not at an obnoxious sound level either which is great for me personally as my son is autistic. Also found out they can dim the lights and turn the music down more for sensory friendly environment with those needing it or those who request it. The prices for snacks is good as well. They also informed us that we can leave and come back with our receipt as the price for entry is an all day pass. This would be a great place for a party with everything they offer and the experience we’ve had.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Esmeralda Gomez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Awesome time , my son loves it here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: rossy amador\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Hi, Rossy.

First impression, cclorful and inviting. Love that they have you fill out your information. Not sure if the waiver is an agreement to have a background check, but I wouldn't be surprised and would encourage them to since it's concerning children's safety. Kids are enjoying getting to explore. There is a section for 3 and under and they do enforce the age limit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molly Moreland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Such a fun place when it is too hot or rainy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Down to play is an indoor playground located at the medallion shopping center. It's clean and well staffed. They are attentive to the toddler area and maintaining space for all age kiddos. The reason its worth it is that you can bring your own food and drinks. Lots of places like this require you to buy their overpriced peanut butter jelly sandwiches but not here! Should come back often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joselyn De La Cruz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Absolutely love this place! The price is reasonable given that it’s not by the hour which is a plus for kids who want to burn off a lot of energy! My favorite thing about this place is my back doesn’t hurt when I play with my kid! The height clearance allows me to stand at my full height of 5’0! Which is better than most places. Plus this location is right next to a whole shopping center!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: annie stull\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leslie Vazquez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Such nice play and clean area!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juliet iloegbunam\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: CB D'Undre\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We had an amazing experience here and we will be returning soon!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexi Allen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This place is amazing\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ida K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Amazing place !

This indoor playground is a paradise for kids, with clean play structures, slides, ball pits, and a dedicated toddler area that kept my 6-year-old entertained for hours. The staff were super friendly and attentive, ensuring everything was safe and spotless. I loved the cozy parent lounge, a lifesaver for getting a moment to relax while the kids played. The no-shoes policy keeps things hygienic, and the variety of activities like the interactive dance floor and climbing walls meant there was something for kids of all ages. Highly recommend for a fun, stress-free day out with the family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rider Knouse\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: minerva hernandez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Great place clean and fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Crystal Solis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: SHS General Contracting\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sally Herrera\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A}",

Was impressed with the center and boys had so much fun… they want their birthdays here now 😂🤷🏻‍♀️ …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam Eileen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: I am SO happy this place exists in Maryville. It took a while to get there, but today I finally took my 6 year old son. He has autism and eloping is part of that. Parks, and open public spaces are a no go, because he will run. It is very limiting and keeps us from going most places.  Today we went here after school and he had such a great time. The play area was so perfect for him. He was able to run around free and he didn't stop for the nearly hour and half we were there. The play equipment was all really great. The bouncy slide area was his favorite but really enjoyed the regular slides too. I brought him home and for the first time pretty much ever, he sat down and relaxed. He was worn out. This place will become our second home and I am so thankful they were so accommodating. The prices were much lower than I had anticipated. Which is rare these days.  The ONLY complaint I have is not about this place nor the staff but about parents not watching over their children a bit better. But I guess that is the appeal. To bring your kids and get a breather from them for a second. Not everyone has children with special needs that require constant supervision, so maybe I'm jealous of their freedom. 😂 Regardless I couldn't be more pleased with our first visit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Eller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We had our daughter’s sixth birthday here and it was absolutely amazing. The place is clean, the staff is friendly, overall great experience. Will be doing every birthday party here from now on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica ellison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I absolutely love bringing my son here!! He has the best time and never wants to leave. He is able to play safely inside since it is gated. Great for all ages as they do have a 2 and under section and room for the older kids to play too.\n\nThey have so many activities to do, such as slides, basketball, air hockey, an inflatable obstacle course, and so much more. The pricing it amazing and very much worth it.\n\nThe owners are super nice and very involved with the community. I would highly recommend to all parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Celeste Owen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We live in ga , my husband was on a business trip and we found this place , my kids had a blast!!

All the kids had a blast, there is something there for all ages of kids. Staff were friendly and helpful.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bev\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Maryville's Play Station is now one of my top toddler indoor play places. Decent pricing, a ton of parking available, clean, & a whole lot of fun for the little tots. You can buy a day pass & if you need to leave, you can still come back that same day (as long as you have your receipt) and reenter without having to purchase for entry again. They have arcade games that are free. Snacks & drinks are available for purchase. The only true thing I would change about this place is that it would be amazing if they had a bigger space. But they definitely succeeded in making it a fun play area with the space they have.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Loftis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the 5 stars, hope to see you soon :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anya Barlozhetskaya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 months ago\nReview: Wonderful playground whether rain or heat.

It’s always very clean. Perfect for rainy days when the kids need to burn energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madason Potok\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We found the PlayStation when it was at the mall and are so happy they were able to relocate to a bigger space! We go 2-3 times a week! There’s a 2 & under section which is nice for littles. They have a big obstacle course for bigger kids and other games. Bigger kids can get rough from time to time so i just take my little to the 2 & under area or where the little play kitchens are.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaylee Ellington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My Family and I absolutely love this place! I feel like there is always something to do for everyone, especially littles. They are good about adding extra crafts or things to come and do around the holidays. I have never had an issue here and the staff is amazing and treat us like family when we come in. Birthday parties are reasonably priced which is a bonus. Always a clean and safe environment, and a wonderful way to make friends. I could go on and on about how wonderful this place has been to us, but once again we love this play store. *some pictures added are from the previous location*\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kendra Teffeteller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We had my son’s 7th birthday party here.

It was so much better for smaller kids. My daughter doesn't like this location as much cause a lot of the bigger kids play too rough.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krista Meason\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Maryville’s Playstation is a gem for families in Blount County. The new space is fantastic for kids of all ages. We had a group of kids ages 1-6, and everyone had the best time!

That's very convenient.\nFor after school, or even during the day they will be moving to another area, so they won't be located inside the mall. Any longer\nBut with this new spot they need to make sure that they make it available for all ages, from babies and under 2 to the older children they need to be sure that they have these areas separated.\nIn order to make it convenient for the children and less worrisome for the parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruth Schott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Always fun for our gdaughter! She loves playing there we love that it is a safe place to take her where she can run and get that energy out lol! She has made a number of friends which is great being shes an only child. If you have little ones give this place a try I think you'll love this place too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Adamski\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: There are a variety of toys to play with, kitchens, cars trucks and a play climber with tunnels and a slide.

Just very warm and felt like things weren’t zoned very well. Staff were great! Will definitely go back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather Cooper\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had our first visit today and it was awesome! We will be coming back often! It’s definitely worth the drive from Knoxville. We got to have lunch in the mall and then go there to let the kids play. My 7 year old had fun with the gymnastics mats and the games. My 9 month old loved the baby area so much!!! I didn’t bring my 9 year old but I think he would enjoy the games and mats as well. I’d say it’s perfect for ages from infant to about 7-8 year old. The guy working at the front desk was so kind and I saw him vaccum and clean multiple times while we were there - huge plus! Can’t wait to come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Self\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely wonderful! My twin toddlers enjoy it so much and have a blast!

The owner was very accommodating and set out extra mats for our babies to be able to crawl around! We aren’t big enough for the play area just yet but we will be using it when we are!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Quinn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amazing location inside foothills mall! Tons of activities for the toddler age/bigger kiddos to do, there is even a two and under little separated fenced off area as well.

I’m a full-time nanny for a nine month old and two year old. It’s the only place I feel I can safely watch them both at the same time.  They can go their separate ways without me feeling like I’m going to lose one 🤣.  We go there  about four days a week and the girls never get bored.  The owners are great and they keep the place very clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ASHLEY H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great ownership and lovely place for kiddos!

We recently had my 1 year old’s birthday party there, and it was wonderful! The area is clean, and I have seen the employees cleaning throughout the day. There is an area for the younger kids which is nice. They have a changing station for changing the little ones diapers. The  price is for all day play so you can leave to go to the restroom or eat or whatever and come back to play some more. It’s a great place and option for the kids in the area! I’m glad we have it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Charsha\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great fun place for kids! My 8 year old always has a blast. The toy stations are frequently updated/rotated and the owners take extra care to keep everything clean.\n\nI noticed another review that said there was no changing station, which is not true. This business has been around for nearly a year and a half and they've had a changing station in the back (next to the party room) since day 1. As for bathrooms: that's simply a function of being set up in a mall. There is a public bathroom very close by, and the owners have zero issues with customers having to step out briefly for that and then coming back in to play more.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Living in a city where there's not a lot of fun things for kid, in my opinion this is the best place in town! The price is super reasonable and you can stay all day if you want! My son always has a blast and we have been coming there ever since they opened. All the staff members are super friendly and do their best to pick up and clean throughout the whole day. I recommend anybody with smaller children to give them a try and I promise you and your kiddos will LOVE it! Thank you for providing a safe, clean, fun environment!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mckaylyn Caronna\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 3 and 1 year old always have a blast here and the owners are always helpful and friendly!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Manuel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love this place!!!\nSuper clean, and they are always bringing in new toys and areas to play in.

We had almost 40 guests and it never felt cramped or was hard to move around.\n\nWe got to use our own playlist and even had a glow party! Super affordable compared to so many venues. Best part: all adults were able to chat and mingle while easily supervising all the action and kids. The layout is easy to be able to see everything going on without being on top of your kids the whole time.\n\nCannot recommend this place enough! Book your next party there 10/10\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: TD\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A great spot for the little ones to let loose and the parents get to watch them have fun. Lee & his wife are wonderful and super friendly. They also have a spot in the back for parties. The prices are super affordable.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Green\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brought my year old and four year old daughter to Maryville's Play Station in Foothills mall with the coupons they gave us during the trick or treat event. It was a nice gesture to hand out those passes. The girls absolutely loved it there. They loved the Pac Man video game, the kitchen set and the climbing equipment. The place is heavily padded and kept clean. It allows the girls to be social and play. There's lots of stuff to keep them stimulated and entertained. It's nice to let them cut loose and do their own thing. If you have kids I highly recommend you give it a try. As we all know scrubbing energy off your kids is a good thing. The staff was very nice and the girls had a blast.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristin Lawicka\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun place for my kids ages 4 and 1, so many things to keep them entertained. We love playing here\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christie Curry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids absolutely love it here. We have been members for a year. Always clean and fun rotating stations. Our favorite place to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittney Rutledge\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids had so much fun, and the owner is so kind. We will definitely be back!}",

My kids absolutely loved the idea when we walked in! Although due to the areas being hard to experience because toys were spread everywhere and it being busier than we realized for the small space, we will probably not be back.   This place is doing great and I'm happy that there is a business like this around now it just wasn't for us.\n\n* Also, that shelf of extras (hair ties, lotion, wipes, tampons, etc.) in the bathroom was definitely awesome!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elvira Dimieva\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: A wonderful place to play with kids.

The staff were so helpful and attentive. The decor was amazing and I am glad that I let them handle the balloon arch. I honestly didn’t need most of the extra decor that I had purchased because of how well they had already did on decorations. Everyone had a great time and highly recommend for your next birthday party. I’m not sure if there was a sign on the door that said closed for private event but there were 2 families that popped in and stood up front for quite some time during our party which was awkward for us to eventually tell them they’re not open to the public at that time so that would be my only feedback.\nWe can’t wait to come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allyson Phillips\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Took my 5 year old for the first time today and we will definitely be back!

We've visited twice now and the playground was very clean and well maintained.  There are tables/chairs to allow for work from home parents to get their work done while the kids have a great time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordan Keefer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My son and I both love going to Little Valley Café. It’s a great way to get out of the house and be around people who are in similar life stages, even if no one engages in conversation. The café offers a variety of coffees and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I do wish there were more options on the menu. The bathroom is absolutely charming and thoughtfully stocked with little details. It’s clear that the owners have spent years perfecting this concept and it is apparent. Keep up the amazing work, ladies!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: amiller406277\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I literally love this place so much, I got a job here.

It feels good to be among new and neat plays and toys!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Makayla Bauer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Oh. My. Goodness. What an exceptional place to hold a toddlers birthday party. The staff was so kind and helpful! The place was immaculate and ready for us when we arrived! The party went off without a hitch! I am so grateful. I appreciate that they offer services to cover all of the needs of a party, but that they allow you to bring your own if you prefer. We had my daughter's \"Tea for Two\" birthday and were able to use all of our own custom items and still enjoy everything that the play cafe has to offer.  I cannot recommend this enough as the perfect party spot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey Jaccard Riddle\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Very very cute place. Perfect for toddlers. My 5 year old had a lot of fun. My 7 year old was really too big, but I drug him along! Parents camp out in chairs and tables, so on a crowded day there is no room to sit. Having little lockers for parents and not allowing the keeping of chairs would be helpful for the functionality! A little pricey unless you stay for the day, but great for kids to have fun!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Blalock\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We LOVE visiting the Little Valley Play Cafe!    It’s a great place to cultivate your little one’s imagination and for them to socialize with their peers! You can definitely tell a lot of thought was put into every detail from the layout of the play area to the small extra touches in the bathroom! The cafe itself is also a wonderful expression of comfort. We highly recommend you have lunch sometime and try the mac and cheese! Peak times definitely seem to be in the mornings so if you would prefer a smaller crowd check them out after 12 on Tuesdays and Wednesday for extended hours till 5:30. Knoxville has waited a long time for something like this and we are excited to see this place grow!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lori Beth Leach\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: They truly thought of everything! Money very well spent. 13 month old had a wonderful time and so did I. Friendly staff. Visited Thursday from 11-2. Crowded, but manageable - no wait time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Little Valley Play Cafe has a lot of potential, I feel the space they're in very much limits that potential. I took my little one here to try it out. The front desk area is tiny making it difficult for everyone to both check-in + grab your shoes (they make you put your shoes in a small cubby at the front upon arrival) as you're trying to leave. I do love that it's gated at the entry so no kid can escape. I did not feel the staff I encountered was very friendly. I had trouble opening the gate and she didn't help but another patron did. I do not like that they don't allow you to bring in your own food. I already pay for coming there, I don't want to buy the snacks you have. I don't eat lots of the ingredients in these foods and snacks and I don't want a dessert coffee every time I go. I like the idea of the cafe, I do understand it needs to be profitable, but my family doesn't eat what they serve. Makes it hard when other indoor playgrounds we can bring food in and eat at their designated tables. I don't like that so much of the space is taken by tables and chairs for parents. A lot of parents were sitting at the stools by the wall watching their kids. And then they leave their left drinks on that wall which leaves the drinks open for little kids to come and drink from them before their parent can stop them. I also didn't like that in order to go use the restroom you have to wear your socks. I'd like to be wearing shoes when I go in a bathroom... That's gross. And then any germs from the bathroom are now on socks that are walked around in the play area. I will say that bathrooms were pretty clean when I visited which is very necessary and appreciated. The themed play stations were great, my little one loved them. I love how creative they were designing that. I did not love that a good chunk of space was taken up for a party area. I just don't see how this space was a good choice for an indoor playground. I think this place could be amazing with some improvements. Customer service is very important and employee/owner attitudes I feel set the tone overall. I look forward to watching this place improve and hopefully grow.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elisabeth Fouts\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: First the helpful things to know, then I’ll give you the reason for my 5-start review :)\n1. Check the hours and get there early. They often have a line outside to get in and they reach capacity often.\n2. Be sure that the kids and guardians wear or bring grippy socks. If you don’t have any or forget, they do sell them there for a very reasonable price.\nOK, now onto the reason for my review.\nI can’t say enough great things about the Little Valley Play Cafe and the staff! I went to a birthday party here and everything was magical! The staff arranged for all the decor and the food and of course provided a very clean, safe space to play. I enjoyed playing with the kids in the play areas at first. Then sat by and watched as they continued, while I sipped a delicious latte from their coffee bar. It’s so much easier to keep an eye on the kids with their open floor plan and safety gate. If you have or care for kids under 6, this place is a must. Great for birthday parties, rainy or cold days, or any day really. Whenever you go, you and the kids will be in for a real treat!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Winspear\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Just Go!! I visited this week to check it out for the first time with my 2 kids since opening with a friend and her 2 kids. It was an absolute blast! We ended up going a second time because it was so much fun -- and not to mention the coffee was fantastic!\n\nThere was an incident that happened while we were there of no ones fault, but I watched the owner take amazing care of this sweet boy. After he was all taken care of, they offered him a Good 2 Grow Juice and he got to pick his top. He was back playing in no time. It's always great to see how much an owner cares about their patrons.\n\nLove this place and look forward to it becoming a regular stop for us. I will say it can get busy in the late mornings/afternoons, but I love to see the success of a new business in town. If you want to visit when it's a little quieter, I recommend going in the earlier morning hours.\n\nThe owners did amazing job of thinking through things. There is so many fun sections for the kids and the quality of the cafe is top notch. A great new spot in town!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This place is fantastic. The drink and food options for adults and kids are 10/10. You can tell the owners put a lot of thought and effort into everything. The little dips coming out of each playhouse could use some grippers or something since kids easily slide with their socks. Also it would be so appreciated if the person checking people in can politely say something along the lines of, “and we just want to confirm that no one entering has a runny nose, cough, or fever today?” We can’t avoid asymptomatic people… however, the last time we went, I saw a mom cover her kids mouth when they were coughing and then the same mom took a toy out of their kids mouth, wiped it on her shirt and then tossed it back on the floor. I just wish the whole “please don’t bring your kids if they’re sick” thing was enforced somehow. I still refuse to give this place anything less than 5 stars and still very much recommend it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexandra Guzun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: The best playground in Knoxville. The attention to details is incredible. Location is perfect and I love the coffee and the spots for parents. So happy we can enjoy this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jellis Squared\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This play cafe is super cute and modern. It smells clean! Kids playing in here love it and never get bored. As a former preschool teacher, I’d say the play is perfect for ages 1 (walkers) to 5 at most. I would highly recommend someone on staff to keep toys continuously organized throughout the day, so kids experience each center to its full potential. With the success of this business, I also recommend them to expand into a place much larger (small gymnasium size). Other than those things this type of business is an excellent concept. Keep being successful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Renee Ransbury\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Amazing staff. My son played until it was closing time and still wanted to stay.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Caly Moss\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Finally, a high quality play place in Knoxville! This place is wonderful for kids 2-4. They have such a thoughtful, well-laid out variety of equipment and toys. Everything is clean, and nothing is broken or rickety. Well behaved children and adults. Good organic snack choices at the café (vanishingly rare for Knoxville!). They are also the only kids place in Knoxville that has kid toilet seats which is SO NICE for preschoolers and toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Fatheree\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Little Valley is a perfect play place for littles. There are a wide variety of activities that encourage play in all areas of development. The price to enter is very reasonable. The coffee shop is a perfect addition for adults that you don't find anywhere else. They are typically busy but IMO they do a great job at managing capacity. There's a reason they are busy - because they are fabulous!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emilee Weich\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This is such a dream for parents of young kiddos in Knoxville! Truly something that has been needed here for a long time and it’s been executed beautifully! I would love to see more locations (ahem, Halls/Powell area??), but glad this is an option now! 😊 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Weir\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Such an amazing play space for littles! We stopped in for the first time today, and even though it was really busy, they handled the crowd so well! My 18 month old had the best time playing and mom enjoyed her latte. Can’t wait to return and play again soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beans and Waffles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This is a fantastic play area for kids.  My 4 year old daughter had a great time here.  They have a nice coffee shop inside for adults that has very reasonable prices as well.  Bathrooms and play area are all super clean.  My only issue is that it was incredibly busy when we were there, but that really just shows how great of a business it truly is.  This concept could be three times the size and would still be packed with people if done as well as it is here.  We will definitely be returning, and may look into having birthday parties here as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Colleen Crouch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Wow! This place is perfect for parents and kids. Great selection of espresso drinks and the play areas are so fun. We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bobby.D.

The play spaces are adorable and well-maintained and there are ample comfortable seating options and delicious cafe menu items for the adults. The owners went above and beyond in accommodating my party requests. I highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chapin Jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: An absolutely amazing space! We came here on the day it opened and I was so impressed by the thought put into each space - not to mention how cute everything is. It's so nice to be able to bring my daughter here and not have to worry about her getting injured on anything. The coffee/diversity of drinks at the cafe was also such a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend getting the monthly pass!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: There should’ve been one of the staff members resetting the toys and play spaces periodically. It felt like a kids playroom that hadn’t been cleaned up in days. We sat and ate for 30 min when we arrived and the toys were never reset. My kids couldn’t really engage with the toys or spaces tripping on other toys or seeing nothing on the shelves of the little play rooms, and toys mismatched between the spaces. My kids also came down sick 48 hrs after being there. Overall just wasn’t a clean and inviting space. One positive was the food and snacks at cafe were great options and variety.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Love this place!! My kids had such a great time and I also enjoyed a really delicious coffee there while watching them play. I love how creative they were in designing this place and I also love how well cared for it is. This is a place Knoxville definitely needed. It should be noted however that during peak hours (on Saturday at least), it was a little crowded. So if you have multiple really young kids, it might be best to go during a time when it’s not so crowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Ike\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My 4 year old and I had a great time this morning at Little Valley Play Cafe! This is a great new option for parents with littles. The play area is similar to Smart Toys and Books, but more extensive and with a cute cafe and abundant seating. It was very busy today which makes me very happy for the owners. We'll definitely be repeat costumers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Almeria\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: I’ve been following Little Valley on Instagram for months and am so excited that they’re open. I visited with my 1 year-old for the first time today and we absolutely loved it. These women have thought of everything - from the adorable play area to the comfy seats for mamas, the beautiful murals, delicious cafe treats, high chairs for littles - you can really tell this is a labor of love for them. Highly recommend and can’t wait to come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haley Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Yes, I'm posting a picture of the shelf in the bathroom. Why?\n\nBecause today, when I took my toddler to play and stepped into the restroom, what I saw captured everything I'd felt since we came through the door.\n\nAt Little Valley, I truly felt that my son and I were so welcome exactly as we are. It is CLEAR that this place is run by fellow mamas; every little detail has been considered! The layout is designed so caregivers can watch their little ones while they sip delicious drinks--and by the way, those drinks are hand-delivered to you, so you don't have to take eyes off your child.\n\nBut back to the bathroom shelf. Here you see tampons, baby wipes, breath mints, dental flossers, doggy bags (iykyk), and more. They've stocked everything a mama might need to take care of herself AND her baby in there, and they've done it in a way that is more beautiful than it has to be.\n\nI knew I was taking my baby for a treat today. I just didn't know I was giving myself one too. We can't wait to return.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Buck\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: I am so obsessed with this place! Every detail has been so thought out, this is so perfect, and I’m so glad Knoxville has something like this now 🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Wiske\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: I visited Little Valley Play Cafe the first day it opened and I would 10/10 recommend! My 3 year old absolutely loved it and so did I! What a cool concept for young kids and parents! Friendly staff, clean, affordable and safe! I only wish we had a place like this one sooner when my daughter was a baby and I was home full time with her. These owners saw a need for this in Knoxville and delivered beautifully!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley R.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: I can't even put into words how amazing Little Valley Play Cafe is. It is everything I've ever wanted for a place to take our family.  When I say they have thought of every little detail, they have thought of every little detail. I'm so thankful and appreciate them thinking about every detail around safety and healthy snack choices. On tops of all these things it's so beautiful and promotes creative play in all the ways. I'm thankful to have a space I can also have mom time with other moms and be able to watch my kiddos. Thank you for bringing this to Knox!  It is so evident you love this community so big and we see all the hard work and efforts you have put into this treasured space.}",

They also host fun events there throughout the week! The drinks that you can buy there are delicious, and now I find myself stopping by there instead of Starbucks. It is owned by the sweetest person, and I am so glad and thankful to have this place to bring my children to!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laurel Musacchio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Perfect place for toddlers and reasonably priced!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Destiny Hoelewyn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My little guy had a great time! He loved being able to roam and climb on everything.  The play area was clean and well kept. The owner was very friendly and welcoming, and I enjoyed the drink I got. We will definitely be back! 😊 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jackie McDaniel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: Absolutely amazing the drinks are great. The kids are happy there was just smiles  everywhere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kait\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christa Dover\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My Daughters birthday was yesterday and we went to play with a friend as one of her fun things! She absolutely loved it! It’s perfect for kids! They can run and slide and play and be loud if they want too! That’s what being a kid is all about!! The owner was super friendly,  we had the best time, and she didn’t want to leave! We are having her actual birthday party here at the end of the month and we cannot wait! 🩷\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karigan Spurlock\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: The place was amazing and set up very well and my son really enjoyed his self and I know kids it just kids but the owners kids one of them kept yelling at my son and the other one kept trying to pick him up and pull on him and she than proceeded to try to force my son to go down the slide pulling him onto and I kept having to tell her to stop and not to pull or hold on him. But other than than the place was really nice just not sure if it’s the place for me if something like that happens every time\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krystina Arey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Absolutely love this place. It has everything you need for a fun time with the kiddos indoors. Give it a try, you won’t regret it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Iron&Cloth Productions\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Took my son there today to check it out and was not disappointed! The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Solberg\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old! My husband and I love it because we can sit and watch her without running all over the place. We also don’t have to worry about any injuries because everything is soft and padded. Definitely has become a regular spot for us :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Harris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Okay, I showed up skeptical not knowing what to expect and left with a monthly pass! My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.

This is by far our favorite establishment to go to. I love how cool they keep the building for the kids and parents. They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nick Lackey\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that’s intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out…. I walked away… about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife’s mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn’t melt. All this to say, if you don’t pay the 200$ for a party, don’t take any food or drinks…and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don’t ask if you can bring anything in… you’ll probably get talked about like your a criminal… total of 150$ spent here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joel Crotts\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ricky Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: They have some games to play and plenty of space for the kiddos to play and run and bounce out their energy! Lots of obstacles and levels to play in, a slide from the top level of the play / climbing area.\nWent today and they have rearranged the kids play area some which opened the play area up some.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dina P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: Updated review - 5/22/25\n\nFirst time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn’t help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn’t put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.\n\nThen wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn’t wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can’t I’m super clean I can’t let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!\n\nThen I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!\n\nWould I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn’t happy\n\nThat broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juniel\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had a birthday party and was really bad, nothing fun, it is not according to the description of the page, I even feel cheated because it's not even close to expectations. What a disappointment. Bad place to celebrate 😔 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Marte\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The worst of the places to celebrate birthdays, I feel cheated, I paid a lot of money only for 2 pizzas, a couple of juices, a poor table and a decoration of the worst and to they liking, the bracelets are useless you can't play on the machines even paying for a birthday party, they don't have music, they don't make the birthday boy happy, they don't do anything to celebrate a birthday in that place. Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash Jay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We've been coming to this establishment for years! We love this place. The staff are amazing. The manager here is very professional. She makes sure the children feel safe at all times! If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth James\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexi Helton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Had my daughter’s 2nd birthday party here.\nRooms were clean and staff were super sweet and accommodating.

I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda S\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.\nThey had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Botello-Joffe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We had my son's birthday here and the staff made it so easy!

They have a lot to do and keeps my kids busy and mine have a lot of energy and this place will tire them out. I like this place better than the trampoline parks. They even have COFFEE and snacks. Very nice and neat place and feel comfortable with my kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great for kids of all ages\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kylie Leonard\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The “toddler area” gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn’t get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you’re going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cinthia Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: tomas aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scott Wilson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Great place to take your young children to play.

We've brought our now 2.5 year old here for the past year whenever we are in  town visiting and he loves it.  The ball pit, maze, giant slides, and trampolines are fantastic, and the downtown Salisbury street with the shops that kiddos can play in is a cute addition. Staff are super friendly as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justine Alexa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Philip johnston\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was fantastic when it first opened, but unfortunately, it has declined over time. The cleanliness has become a major issue, with unpleasant odors, visible stains, and deteriorating foam blocks that haven’t been replaced. It’s disappointing to see the lack of upkeep.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Moulton\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Bishop\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: If they had a zero I’d leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don’t fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don’t even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn’t let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I’m another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don’t tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you’re business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Weaver (Kris)\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We had a lot of fun and games for everyone to play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Myers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savannah Sabol-Ross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ludek Vasatko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super 😉 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raven Mcdonald\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kaitlyn toof\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids are obsessed with this place, it’s a great arcade/ jump place, inexpensive & clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bobbie Jo Kelly Greene\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: We had a Birthday party and it was great!!

This was the second time I’ve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It’s not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robyn Lesondak\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Eaton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivelisse Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Khyati Sheth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2 year old loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Larry Ford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for the kids and parents.

She had the nerve to question my son and his cousins age. As if they were lying about how old they are. She said it very nasty too. Then she decided she would half way help me sign the waiver and half way speak or assist me. Didn’t even tell me I needed to scan the QR code. But began helping a woman behind me fill out the waiver and explained it to her step by step. I said “thank you” to her twice within a few minutes. She didn’t respond to either. I’ve brought my son here a couple times because he loves it here. But I promise miss thing in the front with the enough attitude for everyone in Rowan County….move her elsewhere!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Himes\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had fun with my grandson on a Friday afternoon!

The coffee bar was good, which was amazing!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Britainny Purcell\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place - it's decorated really cute and has lots of fun things for kids to do. However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Stern\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn’t expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol\nThis was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molly McClure\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Always a wonderful time at the Fun Factory!

I definitely thought it was bigger from the pictures. They offer day passes memberships and birthday packages. Parents were allowed in the equipment which was great for my shy 2 yr old.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelynn Adams\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any “special” event… this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter’s wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to “sit down and have a special snack” that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn’t tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren’t even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Bartlett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don’t know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn’t take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn’t have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn’t have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mitzi Bare\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the \"reserved\" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the \"manager\" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: crystal moton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids love this place and I love taking them here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Moore\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: One of my daughter's favorite places to visit, the staff is always nice and the mango bubble tea is delicious.

Get there no one is doing this. Go to buy socks for my 14 month old and they charge me and can see he is little bitty. Shows me the socks and says this is all I have and the size was like a 2 to 4 year old size. Oh we can't give refunds she says. Many repairs need to be done in the building. Lots of trim pieces and floor pieces missing or falling off all over. I would drive to another location over this one next time but was there for a birthday party\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dubon Mejia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: nekeisha prawl\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bradley Rogers\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle richeson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun for all\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Timothy Siegel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews…What you see is what you get in their pictures…Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I’ve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning…\n\nIt’s one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents\n\nPlace is priced perfect… it’s not the biggest but it’s not for older kids…The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It’s injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry…\n\nThe food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven’t seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child…\n\nIt feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more…they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jackie Posnanski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun place for my granddaughters to play! One of the best things is that Adults can play too!!!!!!  Great price, very nice staff, everything is clean and they have Coffee there for me so I can keep up with my granddaughters haha.  I've recommended this place to several people I know with little ones.\nTrampolines, Velcro jump suit, obstacle course, arcade games, tunnel slide, and a ball pit area for the wee ones. this place is FUN!!!}",

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way.

I guarantee they will love it especially now because it’s so hot outside. Sprouts is a great alternative to a traditional playground and they accommodate all ages up to 6 years old. Go check them out they’re great!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Young\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jade M Pettit\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cute and low stress place to bring your kiddos!! They have a ton of different equipment for all ages and it's reasonably priced too! My 4 year old and 10 month old had a blast! Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back. I love that so much was included in the package, and am seriously considering a membership now that I’ve seen for myself how awesome this place is ☺️ if I could give 10 stars I would!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zariya Brevard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time here!

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience!

The staff had amazing energy and did several organized dances for the kids (baby Shark, Gracie’s Corner) and played lots of great music for them!

Neither of which were done except sweeping by the staff after the fact . My dad didn’t get to enjoy the party due to watching our food platters and dessert tables from a known ant issue . I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive. My children and I visit here frequently and I typically speak highly of this place but we won’t be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa Aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This place was perfect for my little.

It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility.

We had the room upstairs. It worked out perfectly.  The staff was helpful and courteous.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquia James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had a chance to take my 2.5 yr old to Playland while visiting family in Charlotte. She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Perham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trey Gouch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Frye\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Since outside snacks and food aren’t allowed, I wish the owners would offer healthier options. The little muffins are HORRIBLE for you, as well as some other snacks here for purchase. Please offer options with no preservatives and chemicals. Other than this, the place is totally fine!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Serge Filipskiy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zadie Templeton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: First time there this morning and my daughter loved it and so do we\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Infante\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.  The cafe has delicious drinks and snacks as well.  Definitely a 10/10.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brooklynn Dease\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Love the coffee, the playground and the staff!

I would not recommend for older than 4+ as it would bore them fairly quickly (IMO). Snacks, hot dogs & quesadillas, plus all kinds of beverages. Very friendly staff! They need to purchase newer cars for the kids that have more sensory things on them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nijel DeVore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Good Fun For Kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandi Sparks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatriz Requejo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best coffee in town!

It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank u for the best afternoon.

Clean and aesthetically appealing for the parents. Minus one star because this play cafe is Expensive.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

There is so much for them to do from slides to ball pit, kitchen play, magnablocks, ball pit, ride on toys. I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space! My 3yo, 6yo, and even 9yo very much enjoyed their time. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. The food options are fresh and plentiful. Children are kind to each other. Lovely first experience, would definitely go back:)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was the perfect place to enjoy a couple of hours of active play with my two toddler granddaughters! (Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff.

It is a nice, clean  and affordable facility for a good play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keller Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids were disappointed because it rained and swimming was off the table.

Our toddler enjoyed it. Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing. So just be aware there’s lots of germs floating around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joannn caplinger\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Place smelt like sour feet and toys were laying on floor tripping hazard they let big kids run amongst small ones the changing table was very dangerous and not permanent and secure.

My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted.

We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid.

We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Cape\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cool place to explore with your little ones! Coffee was top notch as well\n\nWe will be back soon for another adventure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean.

My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly.

Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Cora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had such an amazing time at playland today. The coffee is also amazing.

I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

When will you be reopening?\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angel Sabnani\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had our son's 3rd birthday party here in early May and I can't say enough good things about it!  We had brought our son here a few times before and he loved it, so we thought it would be the perfect place for his party.  He and his friends had more fun than I even imagined they'd have.  It's the perfect play area for their age, and there are so many fun things for them to do.  Everyone talked about what an amazing place it was for a birthday party!  We had to drag our son out at the end because he was having so much fun he didn't want it to end.  Haha.  As far as setting the party up, Katina was AMAZING!!!  She was beyond helpful and so incredibly sweet.  I'd do another party there just because of how wonderful she is!  All of the girls working that day were great.  They were all so sweet, and I really appreciated them!  Thank you again, Katina!!  We can't wait to come back and see everything after the renovations!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rose Kaufman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My 3 1/2 yo son has loved this place for almost 2 years now.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: khamis bashir\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Amazing place for kids and stuff very kind specially Katina\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rich Redd\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I like the one in Cary but I love the one in Durham is some more space and more things to do for bigger kids and adults\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Salamino\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Hi Lauren, \nThank you for your positive review.

My granddaughters (5 & 7) were the just the right sizes and ages for most the activities. Trampolines, mazes, slides, a swing carousel that the kids absolutely love… they also have ball pits, swings, and rocking toys for the younger ones. Bring a pizza in or utilize the vending machine. Not too big that you’d ever lose track of the kids-you can always spot them.  And Groupon has great discounts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reagan Elizabeth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We love angel island!

The play structures are well-designed, safe, and perfect for keeping little ones entertained for hours. My daughter and  her friend went for a play date and they enjoyed the variety of activities available, from slides and climbing areas to interactive play zones. Angel Island is a great spot for a playdate or even a birthday party.

Everything is nice and clean! All age kids can do something I love this. So glad I found  Angel island fun park.

It was mostly 3-6 year olds and kids over 8 are not allowed to play here. I think with such a young age group, you should allow parents to go into the play gym to be able to retrieve lost children. I can't see our family returning to any of the locations.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matthew Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Friendly and fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin S.

We went on a Friday afternoon. Not crowded at all. They have several reasonable payment options and a waiver you sign via scanning a bar code or doing it online. We opted for the $20 one-time visit (there's a 59 monthly option or a $72 punch card option plus more options). The $20 one-time play option was good for 3hrs of play! 😎 We also purchased $3 non slip socks, so bring your own and save some cash. They also offer snacks and drinks for purchase (didn't see any hot food options), or I think you can bring your own snack and sit at the tables, check with the store. We did see children with their own water bottles in the sitting area.  I know they told us no food or beverages in the play area. They have a cubby for shoes. Free \"community\" flip flops for bathroom use (must remove your shoes for bathroom use) Im guessing you can bring your own disposable foot coverings if you're uncomfortable using the public flops, ask the store. The restroom was clean and so was the play area - soft padding for little ones. Our 3 year old navigated the play area on his own, under our watchful eyes. Parents can sit at the little tables outside the play area with a full view. The play area is also fenced with open entrances so you can stand and watch your kiddos. There's also two pay-as-you-go massage chairs in the sitting area against the wall - you can relax while getting a massage. If I recall correctly, the cost was about $5 per 10-15 minutes. I believe their website states this play place iso ages 8 and under. Parking was ok but the place is in a small plaza and if they get super busy it looks like parking could be an issue. We enjoyed our time and will be back soon. We recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haley Hufton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I’ve always wanted to try this place but finally got to it today and we will definitely be back!!! Like already planning to go next week!  First off the lady Katina at check in was SO friendly and a bubbly personality. She was so fun to talk to and constantly was cleaning at different times to make sure everything was clean. Which is especially nice to see during the winter months when it’s sick season! I have never seen an indoor play space with the staff this nice and the facility this clean. I loved there was plenty to do for my girls but it wasn’t too big that I was having to run around everywhere looking for them. There’s also a vending machine that has drinks and snacks. Which was a lifesaver when they build up an appetite playing! 10/10 recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maddy Schatzle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Love love love this place!

Yet some 30year old man can chase their kid on equipment. Crazy! Never going again! I brought my 3 yr old and 9 yr old. My 9yr old almost broke out in tears! But she said she would stay for my 3yr old. I thought it looked fine for a 9 yr old but apparently not. I guess I’ll stick to other places instead of a 45 minute drive. To a place I had to watch my 9yr old cry about.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hollie Templeton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great place, friendly staff, clean environment\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Nunley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was so wonderful!

This is by far our favorite establishment to go to. I love how cool they keep the building for the kids and parents. They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nick Lackey\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that’s intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out…. I walked away… about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife’s mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn’t melt. All this to say, if you don’t pay the 200$ for a party, don’t take any food or drinks…and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don’t ask if you can bring anything in… you’ll probably get talked about like your a criminal… total of 150$ spent here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joel Crotts\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ricky Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: They have some games to play and plenty of space for the kiddos to play and run and bounce out their energy! Lots of obstacles and levels to play in, a slide from the top level of the play / climbing area.\nWent today and they have rearranged the kids play area some which opened the play area up some.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dina P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: Updated review - 5/22/25\n\nFirst time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn’t help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn’t put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.\n\nThen wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn’t wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can’t I’m super clean I can’t let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!\n\nThen I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!\n\nWould I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn’t happy\n\nThat broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juniel\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had a birthday party and was really bad, nothing fun, it is not according to the description of the page, I even feel cheated because it's not even close to expectations. What a disappointment. Bad place to celebrate 😔 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Marte\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The worst of the places to celebrate birthdays, I feel cheated, I paid a lot of money only for 2 pizzas, a couple of juices, a poor table and a decoration of the worst and to they liking, the bracelets are useless you can't play on the machines even paying for a birthday party, they don't have music, they don't make the birthday boy happy, they don't do anything to celebrate a birthday in that place. Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash Jay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We've been coming to this establishment for years! We love this place. The staff are amazing. The manager here is very professional. She makes sure the children feel safe at all times! If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth James\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexi Helton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Had my daughter’s 2nd birthday party here.\nRooms were clean and staff were super sweet and accommodating.

Reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sharon Weber\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda S\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.\nThey had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Botello-Joffe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We had my son's birthday here and the staff made it so easy!

They have a lot to do and keeps my kids busy and mine have a lot of energy and this place will tire them out. I like this place better than the trampoline parks. They even have COFFEE and snacks. Very nice and neat place and feel comfortable with my kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great for kids of all ages\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kylie Leonard\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The “toddler area” gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn’t get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you’re going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cinthia Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: tomas aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scott Wilson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Great place to take your young children to play.

We've brought our now 2.5 year old here for the past year whenever we are in  town visiting and he loves it.  The ball pit, maze, giant slides, and trampolines are fantastic, and the downtown Salisbury street with the shops that kiddos can play in is a cute addition. Staff are super friendly as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justine Alexa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Philip johnston\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was fantastic when it first opened, but unfortunately, it has declined over time. The cleanliness has become a major issue, with unpleasant odors, visible stains, and deteriorating foam blocks that haven’t been replaced. It’s disappointing to see the lack of upkeep.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Moulton\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Bishop\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: If they had a zero I’d leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don’t fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don’t even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn’t let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I’m another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don’t tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you’re business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Weaver (Kris)\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We had a lot of fun and games for everyone to play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Myers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savannah Sabol-Ross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ludek Vasatko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super 😉 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raven Mcdonald\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kaitlyn toof\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids are obsessed with this place, it’s a great arcade/ jump place, inexpensive & clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bobbie Jo Kelly Greene\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: We had a Birthday party and it was great!!

This was the second time I’ve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It’s not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robyn Lesondak\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Eaton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivelisse Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Khyati Sheth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2 year old loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Larry Ford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for the kids and parents.

She had the nerve to question my son and his cousins age. As if they were lying about how old they are. She said it very nasty too. Then she decided she would half way help me sign the waiver and half way speak or assist me. Didn’t even tell me I needed to scan the QR code. But began helping a woman behind me fill out the waiver and explained it to her step by step. I said “thank you” to her twice within a few minutes. She didn’t respond to either. I’ve brought my son here a couple times because he loves it here. But I promise miss thing in the front with the enough attitude for everyone in Rowan County….move her elsewhere!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Himes\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had fun with my grandson on a Friday afternoon!

This place is very dirty. Constant mass chaos and not made for children under 4. Children 12+ were in the 5 and under play area throwing balls and knocking over 2/3 year olds. No staff or guardians in sight.

However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Stern\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn’t expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol\nThis was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molly McClure\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Always a wonderful time at the Fun Factory!

I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any “special” event… this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter’s wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to “sit down and have a special snack” that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn’t tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren’t even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Bartlett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don’t know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn’t take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn’t have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn’t have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mitzi Bare\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the \"reserved\" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the \"manager\" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: crystal moton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids love this place and I love taking them here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Moore\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: One of my daughter's favorite places to visit, the staff is always nice and the mango bubble tea is delicious.

Get there no one is doing this. Go to buy socks for my 14 month old and they charge me and can see he is little bitty. Shows me the socks and says this is all I have and the size was like a 2 to 4 year old size. Oh we can't give refunds she says. Many repairs need to be done in the building. Lots of trim pieces and floor pieces missing or falling off all over. I would drive to another location over this one next time but was there for a birthday party\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dubon Mejia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: nekeisha prawl\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bradley Rogers\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle richeson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun for all\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Timothy Siegel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews…What you see is what you get in their pictures…Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I’ve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning…\n\nIt’s one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents\n\nPlace is priced perfect… it’s not the biggest but it’s not for older kids…The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It’s injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry…\n\nThe food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven’t seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child…\n\nIt feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more…they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jackie Posnanski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun place for my granddaughters to play! One of the best things is that Adults can play too!!!!!!  Great price, very nice staff, everything is clean and they have Coffee there for me so I can keep up with my granddaughters haha.

My son booked his daughter's birthday party here, and we will never book here again.  When you pay over $300 for 2 pizzas and water, a host, 2 hours of room time, and unlimited play, you expect to get what you pay for.  It is overpriced, you don't get what you pay for, and the employees dont seem to want to be there. First off, when we arrived, they changed the price that was quoted to him, and he was charged more than what was agreed upon. The employee didn't seem to care and didn't really try to explain the discrepancy.   The tv they have with advertisements shows that first responders get free admission. When she was asked about it, she just said no, it's 10% off. No explanation. When questioned about what it said on the screen, it seemed to make her mad that she had to go clarify with someone else. Very poor customer service. There was supposed to be a host for the party, but we only saw her once when the pizzas were brought out. (The same person that checked us in) The playtime is supposed to be \"all day\" and \"unlimited\", but when they arrived an hour early as was stated that they were supposed to do, only to be turned away and told to come back 15 minutes prior. The party was at 4 pm. The so-called unlimited play is definitely not unlimited. They only had 3 people on staff that we could see. That is ridiculous for a place that big, with parties scheduled. There's no wonder that the party \"host\" only showed once. The 2 hours of private room time is cut short, too, because they want you out 15 minutes prior to clean up. I understand that, but when you do follow the rules, then it's at least another 30 minutes before they come to clean the room. Why were you told to leave? The party next to ours had the same time frame and were still in the room another hour after their set time and were never bothered. Had we known that we would have stayed. Overall, this place is just a huge letdown. Next time, we will book at Chuck E Cheese. You at least know what you are getting there. And they have gluten-free options, too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla Nantz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Kota and Ty went above and beyond for us, staying open so we can play after a long day of traveling from Alabama and attending a funeral.

We received a call ahead of time that walked us through everything and were checked on several times during the party. Food was served exactly when planned.

They do not have a single person monitoring the play area (Catch Air does!).

Today was the best experience we have had. The manager had socks ready for us before we got here. All we had to do was sign a document and go play. Truly the best customer service experience we have had in the few years we have been coming here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R L\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: my son got strap throat right after visiting there, extreme hygiene hazard there!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vera Dowis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We had a great time with our grandkids.

Monica, was so nice and a great host to our family. We came for a 8yr old play date / makeshift birthday party, we didn’t rent a room or book a party we just had 5 kids and 3 adults playing for a few hours. Great time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leonardo Abbrescia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 weeks ago\nReview: I left a 5 star review about 10 months ago and highlighted then how incredibly supportive Monica was to my disabled son and personally made sure he was able to enjoy Billy Beez just like all the other kids.\n\nWell, we just took an 8 month hiatus for personal health reasons, and on our first time back after so long, Monica remember my boy by first name!! Who does that other than family? She is as kind as supportive as ever.\n\nI also have to highlight the manager Chimese. She is also so kind to us and always checks in with us after we arrive to make sure my son is safe and happy.\n\nJust incredible!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Henry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I’m at the Mall of Georgia BillyBeez and I must say all the way from Baltimore it has been a pleasure and pleasant visit from Ms Monica and her staff’s hospitality to the safe, fun, and friendly environment for my kids to freely run play and be themselves I want to offer a Special thanks to Ms Monica for her friendly spirit and helpful conversation I only can do 5⭐️ BUT this experience for me has definitely been a 10/10 and every opportunity I get to come and visit I am Chuck E Cheese is out we found our new spot ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashyriah Ka\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: We enjoyed Ms. Monica and Ms. Chimese they are very nice!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ms. Jackson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Omgggg!

Nothing looks like it’s been cleaned in months or even years. AC wasn’t working either so all you see is kids running around sweating.

I preferred other kids indoor play  like catch air etc..they have lots of activities there here in billy bees they don’t have anything accept slide for babies. My 14 month over in 30 min.Not worth the money you pay.I won’t prefer this place.plus asking extra for socks.looks the picture it’s only that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kevin Peopless\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Dear Kevin Peopless,\r\n\r\nThank you for the rating.\r\n\r\nThe excitement dims when you're gone – we can't wait for your next visit.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\nBilly Beez Customer Service\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Grey Reyes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Hey Grey Reyes,\r\n\r\nThank you for the rating.\r\n\r\nWe can't wait for your next buzz-worthy visit!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\nBilly Beez Customer Service\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: goldie lane\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Last weekend 4/27/2025, my daughter had her 6th birthday party here.  We arrived 30 mins prior, signed the paperwork and paid the remaining balance.  The young lady who checked us in was great.  She told us that our room wasn't ready but she was gonna go clean it and then we could set up. That process was smooth . Things went downhill from there.  Upon arrival in the room,  we noticed that it was super hot so we opened the door to let some air in. The temperature never really got better, so i found the young lady and asked her if the air was working she said that maintenance had been by and said they fixed it.  As my guests began arriving,  it got worse.  It was so bad,  we had to share the portable fans and few guests brought.  I constantly asked the staff to turn on the A.c. with the same response as before.  So we move on to the pizza.  I ordered an extra pizza for the parents and when the 2 bday pizzas and extra ones came out. 2 of them were burnt. We had to send them back, with hungry kids asking for more pizza. I also ordered pitchers of fountain drinks.  They were out of everything I asked for, except sprite. Not only were they out,  I had to go and pick up the pitchers myself.  I also had to serve the pizzas,  cake and clean up after the kids ate the pizza in order to make space for them to have desserts. We looked around for staff to assist us with the party,  but the 3 of them were stretched so thin we could never track them down.  This was the worst party I've ever paid for.  From extreme heat to the burnt pizza, no staff to assist.  It was just terrible. No one offered any alternatives, no assistance,  nothing.  Since that day,  I called the customer service line a few times and have heard nothing back. Customer service is lacking, besides for the young lady who checked us in.  If y'all are going to charge so much money for a party,  you all need to have the resources to accommodate each party.  When we book these parties,  we book them with the understanding that we are gonna get what we're paying for,  ie; un burnt pizza, fountain drinks that are listed, assistance during the party, air conditioned rooms that seats several people etc. I will never book with you all Again and I'll make sure my loved ones do not either. Just terrible.....\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Díaz-Robles\nRating: 2/5\nTime: Edited 2 months ago\nReview: We came back here on November and a kid bited my 6 year old daughter and then a slide was about to break when she was in it do not visit ever if you don’t like broken theme parks\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Panos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Had my daughters birthday party here and we had a blast!

If I had just brought my kid here to have fun on a Saturday morning, I’d leave a 5 star review.\n\nThe pros:\nThe play place is VERY clean. The tunnels and slides seem well attended to. Over all the facilities are great.\n\nThe cons:\n\n-after paying for a party package, paying for extra people on top of the party package, and paying for food- we were informed that no outside food is allowed. No veggie trays, no fruit, no drinks. It was over $80 for 12 juice boxes, they do not offer any semblance of fruit, veg or fiber. If this was offered, I would understand no outside food- but the fact is, their soda machine was down and all they have is pizza that isn’t even little ceasar quality and candy bars. If you don’t offer it and people have booked a party with you, the fair thing is to allow them to bring it.\n\n- the place is not equipped with an intercom of any kind, so you cut your kids loose to go play- pizza comes, you want to get all those kids back in that room? Good luck - they’re in the tunnel maze.\n\n- they started prompting us out of the room by 1:00. Our party was 11:30-1:30. If we only get 15 minutes to set up, don’t rush us out without offering help. It’s rude.\n\n- customer service was non existent, no one offered to help us clean, they seemed inconvenienced that we had left shoes in the room.\n\n- no one wished my child happy birthday.\n\nLame.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J.K.

Very strict rules on place about signing a waiver and walking on socks. But a homeless person was allowed to get in with out a child to wonder around in the play area. Going table to table soliciting money. How is this safe for family and kids visiting this location.  I brought this to the manager attention and they did not no what to do with the situation.

Mother of Cashew purchased the birthday package for 10 kids and you would have to pay for additional kids who show up. LaTasha was our hostess and she hit it out of the park. Things to know, you need to sign a waiver before you enter the main area with the iPad by the register. Another step is taking off your shoes before you go into the main seating area. The kids and jump, slide, run, etc all over the building. They do have some bikes but you have to pay extra, there's time included with the bday package. LaTasha brought us the cupcakes, drinks and helped pick up after the party. This is a safe place to have a party so we recommend the place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: P Eliz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean , great staff friendly and caring , my kids love it here !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Ponce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Fun indoor playground.

My one year old can’t enjoy all the facilities so I think he should’ve been discounted. They also don’t allow outside food or drinks so it can get even more expensive with food. They don’t allow grip socks and my 2 year old fell and hit his head twice. I will not be back here for awhile.

The package we got was apparently the kids meal package even though we brought our own pizza and cake. So that means that every kid after the first 10 kids is $39 dollars extra per kid. Which cost more than the entry fee. We had a total of 24 kids we spent $957 dollars for the kids to play on a jungle gym. Our hostess was apparently on break and abesnt the whole party. We passed out the food, poured the drinks, picked up all the trash. No announcements are made, no rounding up kids, no helping with the cake. By the end of it my wife was ready to put on her kids empire shirt and clock in and I was ready to put on the dragon suit and hop around for the parade. What exactly did 957 dollars get me? Not to mention, there wasn't enough cups or plates either, but that's okay we brought our own. Save yourself some money and go to urban air or a skating rink if your having a birthday party for more than just your immediate family.}",

I was nervous it would be a long drive, but it's right off the highway, making it a short trip. The coffee shop has lots of goodies including snacks and drinks for kids, the bathrooms come with a step stool and changing table, and the couch is comfortable. Bring your laptop and use their wifi at any of the tables, and let your little play while you work AND your house stays clean. There's multiple play areas with a house, a construction area, a climbing and slide set, dress up clothes, and even a separate area for 2 and under. I wish we had visited sooner, and if you visit more than once a week, the membership is worth it, but you'll be here more often!

From the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to make the day extra special. They thought of every little detail to ensure the event was perfect for both the kids and adults. The team was incredibly sweet, attentive, and helpful throughout the entire party, making sure everything ran smoothly.\n\nOne of the highlights was the “balloon drop” near the end of the event…the kids were overjoyed.  Another highlight, for the adults attending, was the delicious coffee they served—seriously some of the best I’ve had! The kids had a blast with all the fun activities, and the atmosphere was welcoming and full of joy. It was a day we’ll remember forever, thanks to the amazing team at Village Play.

Seating area was spacious and comfortable. Play area was a bit of a let down. There were almost zero toys to play with. The centers were empty. The doll house had no dolls or furniture. The items that were there were very worn.  The website photos make it seem “more” than what you are actually getting. I understand that toys getting used by multiple children over the years get worn out, but this is a business and items should be re stocked and replaced as needed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tamia Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had our daughters first birthday party here and we were so pleased with everything! Village play staff helped us with setting up / cleaning up for the event . They were available during the whole event to help us with anything we may have needed. They communicated greatly with us. Our guest loved the area for lounging and our kids loved the area for playing. Village Play was very clean/neat. We loved how we didn’t have to provide a lot the facility had just about everything we needed besides our decorations. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who’s looking for a place to have a child’s party at. We were very fortunate to have found this place for our daughter’s birthday party. We will book again. Thanks Village Play for making my daughters first birthday such a pleasure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Teddy Chip\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Went for the first time, appreciate that they have a capacity for the play area. A big shout out to those who work there. I saw them constantly cleaning up the play area, major props.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: PARENTS BEWARE! Read your waiver agreement CAREFULLY. I was invited to a birthday party by some friends, I guess I was the only one in the group to read the waiver. When you sign the Village Play waiver, it goes beyond the obligation of holding Village Play harmless. You will also agree to “indemnify and defend” Village Play. For those of you who don't know legalese, when you agree to indemnify and defend a business you agree to take on and/or reimburse all legal costs on their behalf. This includes ALL attorney’s fees, court cost, and judgments. This could make it possible if your child is involved in another child's injury and the other parent decides to sue you and Village Play, not only would you have to pay an attorney for your own defense, but you will also have to pay for Village Plays representation, costs, and judgements. Additionally, this could also make it if a parent sues Village Play for an incident that involved you or your child, Village Play could also forward you the bill for their legal cost because you have agreed to defend them in court and reimburse their fees. Such agreements may also make it possible for you as a parent to burden such expenses under the most loose of connections. In my opinion, these are terrible clauses and even worse business practices. Holding harmless clauses are strong enough defenses for a children’s business, but clauses to agree to indemnify and defend is a highly offensive legal approach that has the potential to financially decimate an average household income. Unless such verbiage were to be removed from an agreement, I would advise staying FAR away from a children-centered business that implements such measures and consider an alternative place to bring my children and/or host events. In my opinion, Village Play falls in the same category as the chain trampoline parks deserves one star for this practice.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Faye Murray\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Staff is super friendly and everything is always so clean!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Rainey\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Very frustrated with my experience today. I have been eyeing this place for a long time and finally decided to give it a go today. My spouse has been out of town for work for the week and I wanted something easy and fun to do to get the kids out of the house and play. After packing the kids up and driving from Greenville to get there, we walked in and the kids were SO excited. We waiting in line to pay and were asked if we checked in online. I had checked out their website and facebook all morning prior and no where did it say to check in online. We were told they were full and we would have to wait. Every table was taken with kids waiting so it was clear we were never going to get a chance to play. I left with two really upset and crying kids who were looking forward to somewhere new. They should really post this information online and give new patrons a heads up about their process. We were looking forward to a fun morning and checking out a place to host my daughters 2nd birthday.  We will not be returning as it was not worth our time and money. I took the kids back to Greenville and we had a blast at Unity Park!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Synthia Kohlmorgen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haylea Morris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Sligh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Clean and friendly indoor play place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S.

This was our first time there and I can say that we will definitely be back again. I love how every little one is able to play together or independently without being trampled over by bigger kids or inattentive parents not showing their kids to be careful around smaller babies. Other establishments aren’t as attentive about this and this is what set Village Play apart from the competition. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. The owner was such a sweet soul and even came through to reorganize and pickup the centers as more kids came in so everyone would have a great experience. She certainly gets the meaning behind “it takes a village”.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dana Ashley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: Great place to bring the young kiddos!

Just a very cozy atmosphere. Everything was so clean & sanitary too which I loved. Definitely recommend & will be back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ryan Nowland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christopher Lee\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brie Frist\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gretchen.

We have been coming since opening day and love the experience we have with being able to interact with different ages in such a fun setting! The different rooms  provides options with out being overwhelming for kids and teaches them how each room works. The play gym is great for older kids and the big and little slide helps separate while still including everyone. The healthy snack options and natural cleaner they use to clean all the toys and equipment makes us feel so much better about our little ones playing here. They also clean multiple times a hour which is a huge relief! The owner is such a sweet kind person and we thank her often for providing such a good environment to bring our kids to. Can’t recommend this place enough!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ed paige\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Great place for grandchildren to have birthday party on a Saturday\nVery clean and nice people 🙂 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Moody\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alyssa Watson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: So I hate to be a Debbie downer here. I really do.\n\nBut I’ve had friends who continuously recommended this place to me, so I finally decided to try it.\n\nI went on Saturday afternoon and the same occurrences took place as this afternoon. So weekend or not this happens. I tried to give it a second chance.\n\nI have a 1 year old and a 2 year old. The entire time we were there (2 hours the first time and 1 hour the next) there were much older children probably 6-10 years old who were running over my 2 year old. Then older kids were in the “baby” area running over my 1 year old. I did not feel relaxed whatsoever. I felt like I had to continuously stay under my children because older kids were taking their toys away from them, running over them, ect.\n\nParents do not pay attention to their children in this environment and it’s dangerous to younger kids.\n\nStaff does not periodically clean up toys (at least they didn’t while we were there) so toys weren’t in the places they were supposed to be played in.. they were everywhere.\n\nStaff does not enforce rules and parents do not watch their kids (of course staff cannot change this), but there HAS to be a better way to protect younger children. We go to many indoor playhouses in the upstate and we have never had issues like this.\n\nOver the course of the time we were here today, my friends child got knocked in the head with a shopping cart by an older child running and ended up with a goose egg on his head, older children took toys away from my toddler and baby, and older children pushed my toddler down the stairs.\n\nA total waste of $40.\n\nEdit: we actually came on Friday, then the following Thursday. I do appreciate the owners feedback and credit, but just because most younger kids come in the morning doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be able to play in peace on afternoon while older kids parents are supposed to be supervising.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: BurningBread10\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My 16m and 3 year old had a blast! Lots of activities to do, and impressively clean. The cafe has yummy coffee and espresso options, and a small selection of snacks. I recommend bringing a small lunch for the kids if staying a while. This is the perfect place for moms to come and relax while the kids play.\n\nI wish it was closer so we could come more often! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diana H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Such a fun place for kids 5 and under!

They're great for all ages, I've personally taken children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years and they have all loved it. I love that I know the kids are safe and clean, and that I can get coffee without having to make an extra stop. I highly recommend this place for anyone with kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justine Mullinnix\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: We visited Village Play for the first time today and it was great!!! My 2 yr old son loved all the toys that were very age appropriate and fun for him. The space is very clean and inviting. Parents and caregivers can sit in the cafe area and see the playground easily. It's a great environment for play dates and a little down time for parents while the kids play in a safe and contained area. The bathrooms were very spacious and clean. The staff is friendly and we're making rounds to keep toys and play area clean the whole time. We really enjoyed our visit and will definitely return!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasive Guadarrama\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cynthia Bennett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Valerie Colacurcio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Petrie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: This play space is well thought out.  There are good site lines wherever you are.  You don't have to worry about chasing your child (or children)  around just to keep an eye on them. There is a dedicated and adorable space for building/construction,  another space for a barn,  a grocery store,  and a house with a kitchen.  My kids never get bored here: )  There are 2 age appropriate slides and playspaces underneath the slides. I always look forward to heading to this play space.  My daughters gross/fine  motor and social developmental needs are absolutely met here: )  Side note- their coffee is soooooo delicious!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jodi Monopoli\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: Village play is a wonderful indoor play area.

I enjoyed this and I think my 7 year old would enjoy this place. They need more toys for the young toddlers. My toddler became easily bored within the first 10 minutes of our first visit here. Which is unfortunate since Piney is only 9 minutes from our home. Also adding that’s its $15 and some change for an hour I was expecting a lot more. I think adding more toddler friendly activities/toys could easily fix my review.\n\nAside from this it’s very clean and was a good first experience for me.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Rinderer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: What a wonderful place for children to play and use their imagination.

Every detail was thoughtful, colorful, and perfect for the occasion. The kids had a blast, and the entire event was so well-organized that we could actually relax and enjoy it.\n\nWe initially had some concerns because we invited a big group of friends, and we were worried the space might be too small or that we’d somehow be over capacity — but the space was HUGE! It was more than enough for everyone to play, mingle, and celebrate comfortably. Courtney, the owner, even called me personally before the party to check in, reassure me, and make sure we were confident in moving forward — that level of personal care really meant a lot.\n\nWe chose the Pandarosa package, which included 48 cupcakes, sweet tea, lemonade, chicken trays for the adults (so delicious!), and 7 large pizzas for the kids. There was plenty of food and even some left over — they really thought of everything.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Ede, Railey, and Madison who were absolutely wonderful — so helpful, kind, and attentive throughout the entire party. Their energy made the day even more special.\n\nOverall, Piney Town made Zayn’s 3rd birthday unforgettable. Everything was smooth, stress-free, and full of joy. We can’t thank Courtney and her team enough, and we highly recommend Piney Town Play Space to anyone looking for the perfect place to celebrate!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Isaac Miller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Paula Allison\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Fun place for little kids.

They have added to the space and the place always looks and feels clean. It is definitely a great place for the younger kids my 7 year old gets board quickly ( unless he finds a playmate) 3 to 5 year old seem to have the best time. The place is small which is great is only one person is taking 2 kids or if you are meeting up for a play date and the parents can actually talk as your kids are never too far away. Also they sell coffee and snacks if needed! Great local place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerri Starnes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 6 months ago\nReview: We love Piney Play House!

I do wish I had been warned about most of little girls wearing princess dresses. Being our first time I didn't think that was a thing. My daughter felt left out. We saw Belle and she was very snarky towards kids and played favorites with some of the girls. She was very overwhelmed! Would go again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 9 months ago\nReview: I love Piney Town but more importantly, my granddaughter does.   She always enjoys the open play but had her first character experience on Sunday and was ecstatic.  I could not have asked for a more positive experience.   The tickets are limited to the amount sold so it's a small intimate group.  \"Moana\" took time to make sure every child felt special.   They had a group activity, pictures and just a super time.  Thank you Pineytown you are knocking it out of the park.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J P\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: The place seems very clean and the different themed centers are absolutely adorable.  The reason that I’m only giving 4 stars is that there seemed to be a lack of actual toys in each of the centers.  There were probably 20 children there during our visit.  There were only 2 ride on toys, the toys in the themed centers seemed very sparse, and the train table (which was very popular with the little boys) only had 3 magnetic trains.  I’m sure that the reason is to make clean-up more manageable, but helping children learn to share is near impossible with not enough toys to go around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelsey Durham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: This place is so cute!

My children love playing at Piney Town, and at busier times it can get overwhelming for my kids (but great to see a local, family owned business thriving and full of joy!). I highly recommend checking out the sensory friendly playtime for anyone with children who need a calmer environment to explore and play. I am happy to support a business where the owners listen to feedback, ask questions, and work to make their environment enjoyable for all children.\n\nMy family has also attended the daddy/daughter event and a princess event, as well as regular open play sessions and have had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla Gregory\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We always appreciate how clean, organized, and fun this indoor play place is!

Loved they also had a reading, coloring, and sensory type area outside of the main area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Caridad Ramirez\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: overcrowded. Older kids are rude and hoard toys and then taunt the little ones. Younger kids parents were super attentive to them but the older kids did not have parents in sight.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Steve Kovatch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: My grandson from out of town totally enjoyed it!

Kids ranged in age from 2 to about 6. The parents were about 80/20% Helicopters/Free Rangers. Don't judge this book by it's cover...there's a great downtown themed setup inside for creative children's play. Coffee snack bar for the Free Rangers, lolz. Group sizes are limited, advanced tickets recommended.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Hochler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: great fun for my 18month girl\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Mellin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you, Brittany!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Candace Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was one of the best indoor playgrounds I've ever seen 👏 Very clean, friendly staff, two bathrooms and high quality toys and playrooms. Wonderful for cute pics of your kid as an added bonus 😆\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dariene Watkins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Piney Town is awesome!  It is a clean, safe place for indoor play.  It is particularly nice for littles to get energy out without constantly having to say, \"No, don't mess with that,\" as we would at home.  There is a separate space for 2 and under to enjoy age-appropriate toys.  The bigger-kid space offers costumes for dress up fun, a stage for performances, a farm, an auto shop, a grocery store, a police station, a house, a construction site, a treehouse, and an ice cream stand.  There is something for everyone!  We have not yet been to any events, as our little is too little to enjoy them and we do not want to take space from people who are able to do so; but they sound like a good time for kids who actually know the characters.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fantastic location for a birthday party. We had my daughter’s 5th *Barbie* party there today and I was very impressed by the facility and the staff. We will definitely party with them again!

Wow!  It's amazing how much more inviting the space is with just a few changes.\n\nThe addition of the treehouse and seating areas made a world of difference.  My 1 year old and 5 year old both had a blast (which is rare with the age difference).  We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Curtis Reinking\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I took my 4 year old daughter on my day off, the staff were available to immediately check us in (we had prepurchased our time), and the staff was on a constant rotation of resetting the toys after the kids had played with them. Everything was clean and in good shape. There was plenty of room for the number of children and my daughter loved all the activities available.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Hightower\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is such a fun indoor play spot for young kids! My toddlers enjoy playing with all of the toys, dressing up, and the big tunnel slide to show how “brave” they are! During my most recent visit, I was having trouble getting a coupon to work, but the staff member was so helpful and got it all taken care of. Great customer service as always!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara Forbes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a birthday party for my 2 year old daughter this past weekend and it was such a great experience!

Piney Town Playhouse was a fun but not overwhelming environment for littles, and planning/communication was easy. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elsie Aldrich\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had a wonderful time at Piney Town with my 15 month old grandson.  It is clean, well organized and affordable.  I would recommend It for children up to about the age of five.  It’s fun without feeling chaotic.  Abundant opportunities for creative play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaleigh Habel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We've been here a couple times and LOVE it! Lots of options for kiddos to play and imagine! We will keep coming! Thank you! (Also love that they have good coffee.) We bought a spot in advance, but it wasn't busy. However, we have gone when it is! It's nice to have the option to schedule online.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristina Markofski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Boy boys (5 & 2.5) had a blast! They played for the full two hours! Piney town was very clean & I had a wonderful iced coffee! I love how they have the area for parents to sit and work while the kids play! We will be coming back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Grace Lyttle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is such a cute play space! My kids really enjoy it. We recently went to one of the events that they hosted (the Barbie party) and it was so great!\nThey had Barbie come out and read a book, then had a scavenger hunt, and did a bracelet making activity, then they had a dance party. My daughter's bracelet broke during the dancing and Barbie sat down with her to help her remake her bracelet. It was really special.\nWe had a great time and will absolutely be making this a regular spot in the rotation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olivia Clapp\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We hosted our daughter’s birthday party there and it was amazing.

Love the way they “fenced” off the play area!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I love this place for my toddler! Piney Town is always clean, has tons to keep kids occupied and their special events are always so much fun! I just went to the Baby Egg Extravaganza and the live bunnies and chicks made my daughter so happy! They also keep the groups small so if your toddler is just walking they won’t be knocked over by kids that are too old for this activity. I will continue to visit Piney Town and look forward to the next special event!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linda Healy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our little 2 year-old grandson absolutely loved playing at Piney Town at the 8:30-10:30 session on Saturday morning.  He had an opportunity to engage with another child and learned to take turns and share.  It was a great experience for him and for the other little guy as well.  Everyone was so friendly and very accommodating!  Cannot wait to return.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Whitney Cress\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you, Whitney!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susmita Shrestha\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had my son’s 4th birthday party here.

The play areas are clean and the staff very welcoming.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kateryna Solovei\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: 2UPD:\nAfter my updated review, the owners contacted me by email and they were very kind and concerned. They offered me a free 1 time pass to this place and therefore I was hesitant, but decided to give it a try. Its still dusty, the surfaces are sticky, hairs are stuck to lots of the toys, but it's the staff's fault, not the owners. So, here I am, updating my review back to 5 stars. I just don't want to harm this nice family business. It's a great place for little kids to play, amazing idea and a great addition to the area. The staff is extremely friendly, but can't clean well for some reason.\n\nUPD: We used to go there, but not anymore. The place is dirty, dusty and most of the surfaces are sticky and disgusting. The staff members are very friendly, but constantly staring at their phones and don't clean during the day.\n\nThe cutest place for toddlers ever! I wish they had longer hours. The staff is friendly. Fascinating decorations!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adriea Laurore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Went for a character event and had a blast.

I was also happy that it was not overly packed with people and kids, especially on a weekend. Definitely will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Gillespie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: EDITED 2/9/24: I said I would never come back here but I have eaten my words and have changed my review from 1-star to 5-stars. The new owners are amazing and have really turned this place around. They have restructured the play area, now offer snacks and coffee, and provide more supervision during play time. They even offer events each month and have extended their hours to include afternoon play times! Piney Town has gone from being the worst indoor play place around to the best, by far.\n\nI never thought I would be writing this review or have a membership (because we are there at least once per week), but here we are.\n_______________________________________________________________\nTHIS REVIEW WAS FOR THE PLAYHOUSE MUSEUM...BEFORE THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP.\nMy issue is not really with the Playhouse itself but more the culture there. We have been 3 times and the facility itself is great and the staff are always super friendly but, some parents don’t watch their kids AT ALL.\n\nEvery time we have been there has been an issue with at least one kid pushing or shoving or taking toys from other kids (just being kids), but there is no redirection or even acknowledgement from the parent.\n\nUntil today, I just chalked it up to differences in parenting and it wasn’t a deal-breaker for me. As a stay-at-home mom, I totally understand needing a break and wanting to let your kids figure things out socially for themselves. However, today, my child was playing on the fire truck and sitting in the driver seat, when a child literally picked him up out of the seat and threw him out of the truck. I removed the child from the and out my very upset toddler back into the driver seat. I told the kid that he could play there when my kid was done.\n\nThe mother didn’t come over until much later and didn’t even ask me what happened. Instead she asked me “did you just put your hands on my child?” and didn’t even apologize when I told her what happened.\n\nAgain, I know this is not really the fault of The Playhouse Museum, but all the same, I don’t think this place is for us and we will not be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adam Scher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I brought my daughter for the Daddy/Daughter event and it was absolutely amazing. We both had so much fun and the staff was very warm and friendly.

Have also done a birthday party here and it was well worth the money. It's alway super clean and smells great and there is a great variety of inflatables for the kids to play on. Can't wait to continue to make lots of memories with my kids here!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Watkins\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: DO NOT GO HERE!!! My friends girl and my girl were being scared by a little boy, we told them to ask him to stop. He didn’t listen so my friend and I asked him to stop and he still didn’t stop and then he started pushing and corning them with his arms on either side of them so they couldn’t get away! We told him that was not ok and then confronted his parents. He still pursued them and so we told his parents again. Now, non of this so far is the business fault but then the owner steps in while we were talking with his parents and says we should’ve come to her and not “ yelled at her customers, that this little boy comes all the time and is just fine.” My friend says” but he is pushing our girls” and the owner just argues back and it it obvious that she is upset and that this little boy is being backed up and will not stop. so we start to leave and the owner follows us out the door, still yelling, telling us not to come back. This is not the kind of place you want to bring your kids, if this is just one instance of how the owner of the business acts! That is not ok!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JENNIFER LIPSEY\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: Such a fun place. We  brought our boys here for an hour to burn off some energy!

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.

She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles.

They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place!

I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it!

There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business.

My children ages 1 and 4 could stay here all day . There is so much to do , it's great for short attention spans . There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

Went with our little one today and she had an absolute blast. There are so many different play areas that kids of all ages can enjoy.

We will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Allison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cate Niezgoda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 3 and 4 year old played primarily independently for two hours with a quick snack break. They have snacks to purchase if you aren't having a \"Pinterest parent\" organized sort of day. I was able to sip on a cold brew while they wore themselves out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ed Quigley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great indoor play space. Clean, bright, lots of activities.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Vaughan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Funky Frogz is exactly what Sanford needed for kids! A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

I was looking for somewhere to take him to release all his pent up energy.! (Too cold and wet for the playgrounds). Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny.. Ideal place to stop by if you have children that love imaginative and interactive playtime!\n\nPs. I will be back day after day\n\n10/10\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Holly Page\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I love using little bees as a get away for me and my kid to play.

It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue \"Elsa\" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately. Will definitely recommend to other families!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlyn Brown\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We had so much fun!

Very reasonably priced especially for a membership which we definitely get our use out of. Perfect for rainy days or to take a break from the summer heat! The play environment is always clean, well thought out, and inviting. The owners are so kind & plan fun events like story time/crafts and pizza play nights. I love how there are tables to sit and eat a snack or watch children play. Perfect place to meet up for a play date. 10/10 would recommend😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janelle James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My family had the best experience at this indoor play place. The owners were so friendly and down to earth. They are great people and very personable. The environment is targeted to younger kiddos. Our three and six year old kiddos had a blast. They played non stop the full two hour session. We were just stopping in the area for a short while during our travels but if we lived here then we would definitely get a membership here.

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times.

He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way.

Thank you for being open on a tough day after the holiday. Perfect setup for my 2 & 3 year olds as far as toys and sizes of toys. The check-in was easy and the employee was very nice and helpful throughout the 1 hour visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: romeo mullings\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Faith Peterson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was wonderful for a larger space to run and jump and climb on the rainy days! They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Eubanks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great space!

My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back.

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! Wonderful atmosphere and great sensory toys and activities for kids! The staff had amazing energy and did several organized dances for the kids (baby Shark, Gracie’s Corner) and played lots of great music for them!

Very relaxing for me, mentally stimulating and fun for her.  They are very very clean. People tend to bring sick kids to indoor playgrounds but here they clean so often I felt safe letting my daughter play freely. They even have a baby area for parents to engage with their almost toddlers safely. Hands down our favorite indoor playground so far mainly because of how clean it is, the kindness and just the right amount of engagement from the owners.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abigail Geason\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: The absolute best playhouse we have been to so far!\nSo many age appropriate toys for kids of all ages and everything was so tidy and clean.\nThe owners truly make this place!

They have lots of different activities for the kids to enjoy. A nice sitting area for parents to watch the kids. They also offer free coffee which is nice for those who need a lift. They do ask for you to wear grippy socks so the kids don’t slip on anything. They are also continuously cleaning during play time to help keep the space tidy and germ free. The staff were kind and welcoming. We will love to visit again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nakeysha B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We recently celebrated our son’s birthday here, and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish! The owners were genuinely excited to host us, and their enthusiasm made us feel truly welcomed. The entire space was clean, well-kept, and perfect for a kid’s party.\n\nWhat really made the day extra special was the surprise appearance from Spider-Man! He didn’t just show up—he played with the kids and made our son feel like a superhero himself. It was such a thoughtful and fun touch, and our son hasn’t stopped talking about it since.\n\nHighly recommend this place for any kid’s party. Great people, great environment, and memories that will last!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ty Longworth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We just stumbled on this hidden gem and absolutely love it!

I’m so excited that Mount Holly and the surrounding local areas finally have a play place for kids. I was always traveling into Charlotte to find activities. We were in desperate need of a place like We Kan Go Play. They have something for all ages 0-5. The ball pit and climbing wall was a total hit. There’s also a cute little coffee truck at the facility so you can sip while the kiddos play; such a perfect combination. The couple that runs the facility was so kind and generous. We will definitely be regulars here. 5+ stars for sure.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Dionne\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I would give 10 stars if Google allowed it! I cannot say enough about how magnificent our experience throwing our son's second birthday was at We Kan Go Play. Shay and Kyle went above and beyond in every single aspect and wouldn't let me lift a finger. They took care of everything from helping set up, to loading gifts into the car. My son's party was absolutely perfect. If you are looking for a place to throw a party for your little one please consider them. From the play area to Bluey coming out and dancing with the kids it was impeccable. Thank you Kyle and Shay!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mallory Tsiolkas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Our son had the most amazing 3rd birthday party here and we have nothing but great words to speak about the owners.

The very clear thought and care put into every aspect of this indoor play place is unmatched. There were many different types of play available for children including unique puzzles, a ball pit, slide, and lots of imaginary play areas.\n\nAs a mother of two children at very different stages of development I love knowing that they will both enjoy themselves here.\n\nWe will definitely be visiting  again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan O'Brien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 months ago\nReview: Couldn't recommend them enough! I've taken my two girls (4 and 9) for a regular play date and we loved it enough to immediately book a birthday party for the 4 year old.\nWhat you get with a place like this, as opposed to a chain, is that the owners clearly take pride in their work and are very hands on with everything. Everything is extremely clean and well taken care of, the toys are high quality, engaging and actually fun! The area is thoughtfully laid out to where you will constantly find new things as you walk around, but doesn't feel overwhelming with clutter.\nWith the party, I came in to decorate with a random box of decorations and Shay (one of the owners) came out to immediately help bring in stuff from my car and helped put up the decorations with me. Honestly, couldn't have done it without her. They make the whole process as easy as possible, they are there to help when needed and you don't have to worry any clean up!\nOverall, for parties or just a playdate for the kids, this place is a high quality establishment with extraordinary owners!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda O'Brien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We celebrated my kiddo’s birthday here, and We Kan Go Play made everything perfect!

I got messages afterwards from parents of her classmates talking about how great it was. The owners couldn’t be nicer and are very organized. They checked in prior to the party with a schedule, had everything covered and thought through for the food, decor, music, and timing. They greeted our guests and helped with setup and take down which allowed me to just enjoy the party! The space was fun and incredibly clean. We will certainly be back and I would recommend this place to anyone for free play, events or parties!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tanya Barnes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place is awesome!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jerrika Swartz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Such a fantastic, safe play place!

Especially when mama needs a potty break 😂\n\nHighly recommend and we can’t wait for our next visit!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Lee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We had SO much fun!!

So many great toys, all educational and open ended play, not just a playground. So, so many options! The sensory corner is nice, and the baby section is perfect. It’s a little loud, but I mean…it’s kids playing.\n\nYou’re allowed to bring in small snacks and drinks, and they offer complimentary tea and coffee with the option of small snacks to purchase.

The play areas are set up so we'll and even had some sensory areas that my little guy loved! The owners cleaned up and sterilized as the little ones played, making sure to keep them safe and allow some wonderful exploration for both the little ones and toddlers/preschoolers.

Plenty of space but intimate. Engaging and warm owners! Went twice so far, once with my boys and again with friends - They have a 10-day play pass to help you and your family $ave! Take your littles and be blessed!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine Pickford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: As someone who has been to A LOT of indoor play spaces- I would rate this as one of the best. There is plenty of space for the littles to move around and play safely, but it is small enough that you can sit and watch them play and be able to see them easily. The owners were so friendly and the atmosphere has tons to do without being overstimulating. My 2.5 and 15 month old loved and we will 100% be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mini Evans\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Their level of commitment to service, cleanliness, and care are unmatched.

Don’t take my word for it, visit them yourself!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Diane Steil\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Such a wonderful place! The owners have created such a special and NEEDED spot for kids in the area.\n\nYou’re greeted as soon as you walk in with smiles, warmth, and *the most* aesthetically pleasing kids’ space I’ve been to around here. The colors, designated areas - everything was planned so intentionally.\n\nThere’s so much to do, and yet it’s done in a way that invites kids vs overwhelms them. Sensory areas, imaginative play, trains, a scarf wind tunnel, stem activities, indoor playground set, a gated baby play area, climbing and jumping… it’s all there, plus things like board games, color wonder and puzzles in the café seating area - which can also entertain older siblings.\n\nYou can make a cup of (complimentary) coffee, grab a seat, and see your child from any vantage point. Snacks are allowed to be brought in and also available for purchase - plus a water station.\n\nWhile you’re there, you’ll find “Ms. Shay” sanitizing often - checking in, engaging with the kids, and making it feel more like a community than just an indoor park.\n\nWe love visiting here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Q\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wow, what a great place! I could see the whole play area from where the sitting area is, and everything was set up perfectly so I felt totally safe just letting my kids run around without having me right by their side.

They even had free coffee and tea for the adults.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Margaritta Sepko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My granddaughter and her friend loves playing.

If you have a kiddo with sensory sensitivities or occupational therapy needs this playground will help meet several of those needs!

I also love the smaller size of the facility, which makes it easy to keep an eye on your little ones while relaxing in the comfortable seating area or even getting some work done.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart is its commitment to inclusivity. As a mom of a special needs child, I deeply appreciate the thoughtful design that makes it accessible and enjoyable for all abilities. We’ll definitely be back and highly recommend We Kan Go Play for a fun-filled family outing! 10/10! 🤩\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniela Villa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I loved this place!

It’s clean and the ownership takes the time to speak to you and ask your thoughts. Innovative toys, sensory sections, and they also can do birthday parties. Section for parents to monitor is comfortable, and gate entrance once you walk in to ensure your child does not make their way out the door without you. Huge fan and will be adding this place to our list for rainy or really hot days.  Suggest you pre book your play time slot as they do monitor their capacity.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dianna Aboulhosn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We had such a great first experience at We Kan Play this morning. We loved that they were open early for our kids, 4 and 2 to play before their nap and they had a blast! The facility had so many different activities and stations set up for independent and creative play. There was a dress up station, salon, grocery store, ball pit, camp site, blocks etc. They have snacks for purchase and great seating for parents. We are so excited to have a play area like this so close to home and look forward to visiting again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A.

We will definitely be back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Victoria B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Absolutely Amazing Indoor Play Place!\n\nThis indoor play place is an absolute gem! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how clean, safe, and well-organized everything was. The owners were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure all the kids were having a great time while maintaining a safe environment. The sensory area was absolutely amazing, I could tell they really put a lot of thought and time into it. I also really appreciate the area for the babies, my 9 month old enjoy it. We will definitely be visiting again soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miriam Perez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We had a great time! My two year old really enjoyed it.

I feel like it’s the perfect size unlike the bigger play places because sometimes those can be very overwhelming as a mom of 2. The owners are super sweet and constantly cleaning which I love that! So much to play with for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We Kan Go Play is awesome! Inclusive, thoughtful design and a lot of love clearly went into this place. It’s comfortable and relaxing, I had a great chat with the owner today about inclusion of autistic children & she seemed so genuinely curious on how to better include and accommodate kids like mine while keeping everyone safe and content. We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aj H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: A wonderful and safe place for the little ones.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Rothenberg Hunt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My two year old had a blast at We Kan Go Play. The facility was super clean, the owner was incredibly friendly, and the atmosphere was perfect for him to explore on his own without being too overwhelmed like he gets as some of the larger play places. We loved it and will definitely be back!}",

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy. Tons to do for everyone and accommodates all group ages from babies to teens! The staff always goes above and beyond to make your visit nothing short of amazing!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shania Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Came here for my nieces birthday party!

When it was time to go my daughter told me all the nice and sweet things Krysten did for her. I’m so happy that a worker like Krysten could make my daughter have a memorable experience and one she won’t forget.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy W (Mother of 3)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great for the price. Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog. Very impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yesica Robles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great place for kids !

My 2 year old had a blast!! All the staff is fantastic, but Francine was AMAZING!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalie Mays\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

The variety of Hands-On activities, problem solving creative thinking physical toys,  swings, tents even a zipline. opportunities abound for pretend and make believe;  a playhouse,  a kitchen, manipulatives galore. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. The facility is meticulously maintained and clean. My only frustration is that we don't have one of these in Boone of this size and caliber.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jamie h\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This is a fantastic place for a child to relax and have fun without being overstimulating.

I've actually never seen children this age play this peacefully in a long time. I work in the mental health field and I'm well seasoned to these kind of settings. Without a doubt this place had the best staff possible for these kids. My expectations were beyond met. No, my daughter doesn't have autism but it doesn't matter.

We really enjoyed the environment and love that all kids are welcome! Will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J V\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is way overpriced given the area. I was introduced to this place through one of my child’s field trip and decided to take my family here only to be closely and physically monitored more than half the time. I do not have any autistic kids by the way. We had a male coworker literally standing close by my kids, even when I was supervising, fixing literally every single thing along as my kids were playing. It was super awkward and uncomfortable to have strangers that close up in you and your child’s personal space making you feel like you’re unwanted company. I could not enjoy my time with my kids when I was being watched within a few yards by total strangers or knowing they’re hawking my kids down. It’s super weird and it’s safe to say we won’t be coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina (Bri)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Was a perfect place for my nephew to run around and play.

We came in around 1:30 and my son loved the play space immediately. We were the only ones there so got to know Heather who was working at the time. She is so sweet to chat with was gentle and patient with my son who eventually was playing with her and not me.. The play space has pretend play areas and more physical elements like rock climbing and a full sized trampoline. There’s something for every child here.  Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones trying to find a way to expend their energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Volentine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The staff at WRTS is incredible.

From start to finish, every detail was handled with care and professionalism, allowing us to truly enjoy the day without a single worry. The pricing was more than fair, but what truly stood out was the quality, attention to detail, and genuine commitment to bringing our daughter’s dream of a Princess Unicorn party to life. With 27 kids and parents in attendance, the food was a hit, the goodie bags were perfect, and the entire experience far exceeded our expectations. We’re already looking forward to celebrating our son’s big day with you this fall. Thank you for making this such a magical memory!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karina Molina\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My daughter had her first birthday party here and it was absolutely beautiful and great!!

We just had our son's third birthday party at Liberty playtown. These ladies are the real deal. They took care of every last detail and we were so extremely grateful for everything they did.

Ms. Faith gave her a small dinosaur toy to calm her down. I cannot recommend this playhouse enough to any parent looking for something to do with your kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kat Goins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: AMAZING STAFF, amazing for the kids, and great prices!

There not may places for the little ones in our area most places are for bigger kids so we were so  grateful to find out there was a spot for the young ones.

I walked in at 10:10. I drove an hour to bring my little boy just so they could tell me they sent Elsa home early cause everyone else was done with her. There was way too many kids & costs way too much to not be able to walk around or get the Elsa breakfast that we signed up for.\n\nUpdate: they did offer me a partial refund which was nice.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beverly Barraza\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Nice place for kids parties.

It was SO CLEAN which was incredible! It's hard to come by a kids play place that is actually well maintained and clean. It's small enough that I felt comfortable letting my kids play independently and knew they were safe. They had a wide variety of toys that kept both my 18 month old and almost 6 year old well entertained. I cannot recommend this place enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Virginia Ruppert\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I can’t speak highly enough of this place!

The place is exceptionally clean and has so many amazing imaginative play things! My kids were entertained the entire time.

The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Solberg\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old! My husband and I love it because we can sit and watch her without running all over the place. We also don’t have to worry about any injuries because everything is soft and padded. Definitely has become a regular spot for us :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Harris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Okay, I showed up skeptical not knowing what to expect and left with a monthly pass! My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting — sewer water was overflowing and actually leaking into the play area, which is a major health concern. Had we not already paid to play, I would have walked out. The entire facility felt unclean and poorly maintained. I paid $24 expecting a fun, safe environment for my kids, but it felt like a complete waste of money. We left within 20 minutes of our play time and we won’t be coming back. Megaplay seriously needs to address these issues.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Richard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: At 12:15 we are told that we can't enter with our 3 year old because \"the current playtime is about to end and the next one doesn't start until 12:45\". There ONE child currently in there playing. ONE! There are two parents with him. So, there are literally twice as many parents, including the staff, three times as many adults as children here. Still, our child can't come in, and we can't wait inside either for some odd reason. \"You have to come back at 12:45\" we are told. I point out the ONE child thing. Nope, come back at 12:45. I'm informed these rules \"are strictly enforced and have been since covid\". So, I asked \"why have we not been turned away and told to come back at a designated time the last THREE times are three year old randomly decided she wanted to go there\"? With a straight face, the girl behind the counter tells me, \"well, it depends on who the staff members are that are that are working that day as to if the 'rules are enforced'\". Have you ever tried to explain to a three year old, who's now throwing a fit because she can't play, that she has to go somewhere else and can't play because the wrong staff member is working that day? One last try. \"Ma'am, there's one other kid in here, she's all excited to play, no one has ever mentioned this to us before\".  Nope, come back at 12:45. ONE kid! I have no problems with there being rules. I do have a problem that only ONE staff member chooses to enforce them or even make them known. I do have a problem that we were allowed to pay and play three previous times and out of the 5 maybe 6 other staff members we've met, none of them ever mentioned these \"strictly enforced\" rules.\nTLDR;\n1)Whether or not your child can play without an appointment in a building with ONE other child, COMPLETELY depends on which staff members are working that day.\n2)We did NOT return at 12:45\n3)You are not allowed to use the restroom to change a toddlers diaper unless you pay. You can't pay until 12:45.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Craig Vincent\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It's a fun enough place for what it is.\n\nGreat way to spend 90mins and let your kids tire themselves out while having fun.\n\nThe kids play area is engaging for toddlers and there are two pretty cool bounce houses\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It was pretty cheap, nice to play to go on a rainy day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey Vincent\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This was B U L L S H I T\nBULLSHIT.

I booked the party room for my daughter’s birthday party and when we arrived…. It was a TOTALLY different theme. All of the guests were in mini mouse attire and the room was decorated with Moana. I was so embarrassed. The staff went to the back and found 1 pack of mini mouse plates and 2 pack of napkins and offered to “decorate” with those items. They offered to refund me the $30 for decorations and a refund for the 3 EXTRA PIZZAS(that i did not order) to my reservation. Nothing could replace the special day that we were all looking forward to. Also the employees rushed us out of the party room smh.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hello Shneighther\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My baby sister turned 4 today and we decided to take her to play.  she's afraid of the high slides so she wanted to stay and play where the 3 year old play one of the works came up to us and told us that the manager Katy told us she couldn't play there and that if we didn't leave she would call the cops on us. I thought it was very disrespectful and stupid how she said she would call the cops on us because our kid didn't want to play in the big slides. Me and my family are never going back to that dirty place. Mind you it was empty there was only two families there and my family was on of them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alasia Medina\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Good morning, I am formally filing a complaint against the Jacksonville, North Carolina Megaplay location. I took my daughter to megaplay early January around 11:30  when I was told from an employee to come back\nIn 15 minutes as there where three parties going on. My daughter and I then proceeded to wait the 15 minutes which it is now 11:45, come back as to where I was greeted by another employee who stated they have reached the maximum capacity and I could not check my daughter in to play until 5pm at night which was an enormous inconvenience for myself and my 5 year old daughter who was in tears leaving as I had to explain to her that she could not play. I cannot understand how this kind of business can accept employees that toy with children’s emotions like that. And I will post this review on every social media platform so they know the kind of standard that is being held at the Megaplay Jacksonville, North Carolina location. What a disgrace. Zero stars if I could.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Lawrence\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: 3 stars due to cost and needed maintenance and upkeep.\n\nMy daughter (3 years old) absolutely loves Megaplay. She has more fun here than she does at Zing Zumm and Altitute, both of which we have memberships for.\n\nThat said, I think Megaplay is prohibitively expensive as a place to take my daughter. Zing is $100 for an entire year, and for her and I to jump at Altitude 7 days a week for 2 hours at a time it's $40 a month. At Mega, there is no monthly option, so taking her just 3 times a month is as expensive as Altitude unlimited visits.\n\nCan we get a membership option like everywhere else?\n\nAs for maintenance, the junglejims have many spots missing padding, covered in duct tape, equipment removed likely due to damage. The bounce houses have airleaks and tape all over.\n\nI'm not posting this to bash, we really love it and would really love if we could go more often and see some much needed repairs. Thank you and please think about it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Eric Smith\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Well after booking we didn't get to go because it was closed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lakysha Neal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I bring my girls every weekend and they love it and have so much fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: megan bryan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Came for a birthday party and it was a fun clean environment.

I took my kids here because it’s always a great time and my youngest is almost 3 years old. He was in the big jungle gym and I was with him. Well another kid bulldozed into him (not so mad about that bc kids will be kids) what I was and am furious about is the fact that he almost fell from almost the ceiling height to the ground level on the ground. If I wasn’t there he would’ve 100% fell to the ground from up there.\nPictured below is the netting he was gripping onto before the incident happened. When he fell from another kid running into him he was completely under the netting except for his head, I pulled him up immediately and I checked to see if I was being dramatic or not and I was in fact not being dramatic. The net was completely open and any child would have fallen to the ground especially smaller children. This is not safe and should be better handled. Fix this so it doesn’t happen again or worse.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evangeline Jones\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: On 11/15/2024 at approximately 10:02AM My son & I visited Mega play's Center. I am writing this review to raise awareness about discrimination faced by children with developmental delays during playtime. Office Manager of Megaplay left her office door open leaving a safety hazard to all children in this establishment my son entered her office to play on her play rug and we were verbally attacked by this Manager screaming for us to \"get out of her office\". I immediately attempted to explain my son is Autistic and this door should be closed. We were kicked out and I asked for a refund before I would leave. The Manager did grant this refund while speaking in a tone and demeanor not professional or fit for any type of leadership. As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which ensures disabled children have equal access to play and recreational activities my sons experience suggests that such principles were not upheld.  On behalf of my son, I would like to emphasize the need for this environment to become more nurturing and increase the ability for children to be able to thrive here. I am disappointed in my experience both women in this business lacked professionalism. maturity, and the ability to run an establishment properly by using conflict resolution this is a vulnerable child. You kicked him out because he entered your office and then screamed at a parent? I'm mortified...I ask anyone in this community don't allow your children to be treated like this. This business is unsafe, and follow-up will be taken to determine ratio per employees, cleanliness, and overall ability to operate properly. Staff training and creating a more inclusive environment should be required for this establishment to continue to operate.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Ferguson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The set play times make no sense since it is never busy. You cant get your full hour and a half unless you get there at the right time. It’s way too expensive to not get the full time. Also had an older sibling go into the toddler area to help my toddler get off something and she was told to get out she wasn't playing in the area just helping her sibling quickly so i don't understand that either. They’re loosing money with the set play times I saw plenty of people come in and then leave because they’re told the next play time starts in 45 minutes or whatever. Dont waste your money just go to altitude\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Tinsley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: 2 stars.

Needless to say we were very disappointed, it looked very grungy and not cleaned, the padding needs to be replaced in several areas . The toddler area was very small but yet limited, will be glad when the Spring Lake location is opened back up\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelynn Burnett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We rented the party room at Megaplay for my daughter’s 7th birthday this year. I am someone who really struggle with perfectionism and people pleasing. Thanks to this, party planning means a lot of stress for me. The folks at Megaplay were so kind and accommodating from the first moment I called. They had no problem answering every question I had before booking the room. They also explained clearly the fees and accommodations. In addition, they never made me feel uncomfortable or like an inconvenience for needing more clarification or for asking a second or third time. They also confirmed my time slot and accommodations twice before the date of the party. They made it clear they would do all the decorating all I had to do was drop off my supplies, and there was even an option to have them go buy the supplies for you (for an additional charge.)\n\nAll of that is great alone, but the staff really went above and beyond to support me. My daughter woke up sick the day of her party and I frantically called crying and defeated that everything was ruined. Not only did Megaplay have no problem rescheduling me, but the staff went out of there way to offer me reassurance and support that everything would be okay. Not as a customer, but as a stressed out mom thinking way too hard about a pokemon party. The reschedule affected the guest turnout pretty badly and I was fretting around in circles most of the party. Josh and Joyanna were right there for me the entire time. They checked with me every few minutes to make sure I was doing okay. They let me take the reins wherever I felt comfortable, but had no probably helping me direct the flow of the party in my stressed out state. I cannot count the number of times they told me “if you need anything at all please don’t hesitate to let us know.”\n\nThe sincerity of the staff at Megaplay made every difference in the world for me. Thank you so much to Josh and Joyanna for having next level customer support. It was so clear my experience mattered to them as a person not just a customer. They were really able to help turn my entire mood about the party around. I’m so grateful this is where we chose to celebrate and I would give more stars if I could. ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Higdon\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Came here with family visiting. It was very empty, felt very dirty. As we were sitting and watching our children play, we seen the staff standing on tables to decorate for the party the next day, never cleaned the table off, wearing dirty shoes where families place their food at for their parties. When we had the teenagers helping the toddlers in the toddle area, the workers played the voice over saying they weren’t allowed to be in there, yet no one was in the building other than us & we were sitting next to them… but instead of being nice & polite they rudely continued to play the sound seeing that the teenagers were just helping.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this place. It was my first time there and I would never bring my family back or myself. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Taillon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Shepard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicola Gerber\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: They offer a military discount which is appreciated. But you have to come during the certain play times, so prepare. Then we asked to use the bumper cars and were informed since it is within 30 minutes of ending playtime it is closed. It would have been nice to know about it closing when we came in.\nThe large obstacle blow up had a hole where my 10 year old son's leg fell in, we reported it.

They decided to turn off the inflatable with my son in it even though they knew he was in there, and even saw us standing at the end of it trying to get him to come out of it. I reached out and asked for management but never heard back. Then my son asked to go again on his birthday on the 20th and we took him. We were super surprised to find that it was absolutely disgusting on the inside. All the inflatables hardly held my 29lb daughter and were all taped but still leaking air. The bridge at the top of the play place had a screw that was barely holding on and was bent. Then when I went to the front desk to buy drinks for my kids I could not find the lady that was up there till my fiancé pointed out that you could see the top of her head as she was sitting down below the counter on her phone. I tried getting her attention said hello and excuse me, but it wasn’t till the phone rang that she got up a couple minutes later. It really does suck because my kids love it here but now we gotta find a new place to take them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Wangard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Not worth the money in my opinion.

During covid, they were on top of keeping it pretty clean. They stopped play time every hour to walk through and sanitize.  The equipment has always been a bit worn out, but this last visit, I was blown away. They have let this place go all the way downhill. 2 days after visiting this place, my son came down with a high-grade fever.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the only thing I noticed was how HOT and muggy it was inside. Smelled like moldy gym socks. My son was too excited to turn back, so we continued.  My son is only 40 pounds, and he was the only child in the whole building. The bounce house he first picked could barely stay inflated with just him on it. Lots of holes and tape to patch these inflatables up.  And dirt. Lots and lots of dirt.\n\nIn the jungle gym maze part, there is pure filth. Candy wrappers, dirt,  drippings of God know what, and HAIR EVERYWHERE.  Lots of spots in the maze need to be fixed properly before someone gets seriously hurt. DUCT TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING.  Mind you, we were the first ones there for the day.  So surely there were plenty of hours to clean before the next batch of children came in. There are signs all over saying, \" If your child shows any sign of being sick, please inform the staff immediately.\"  Well, it's 2 days later, my son is very sick, and the only place we were was mega play.\n\nI understand that businesses are short staffed, and I will say that the only girl working in there was very kind..... but this filth is absolutely unacceptable at a childs play place.  They charge 12 dollars for one hour. Not worth it at all. I will never ever bring my son back to mega play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jeffrey andre\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Papas play ground\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Seth Lauzon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Granddaughter had an absolute blast playing on everything.

And well worth all of the money spent.\n\nThis place was wonderful for our son’s 5th birthday party. Our son got to experience another kid’s birthday party held here last year and loved it so much, he asked to come back and have his birthday here this time.\n\nJust like last time, the tables were already set up, the room was already prepared for all of the parents and the kids. Literally all we had to do was bring our son and his birthday cake (with utensils).\n\nIf I could change anything at all, I’d want:\n-Help facilitating the pizza-cake-opening presents thing for parents/people who haven’t hosted a party before. Or a reference source offered at the time of the party.\n-Designated birthday seat for the birthday kid at the furthest end of the table.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Helen Guy\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It was horrible.bought token just to find out All the games were out of order.nothimg for the 3 or 1 year old to do.This place is a r ipe off\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya Juarbe\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Mega disappointment\n\nI've been bringing my family and friends to this establishment for a while now, so it’s disappointing to see that little to no repairs or maintenance is ever done whenever we revisit.  It’s very frustrating to see all the out-of-order signs and dirty mats my children are provided to play on. This visit was the most disappointing due to my son's favorite ride being out of order once again on our latest visit. I would assume with the price of entry; it should be sufficient enough for maintenance and replacements of mats and balls for the ball pit. As a frequent customer, I am pretty upset with the lack of care and upkeep of this indoor playground.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cadence Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: love this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juan Yanez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Horrible !!!

The price has doubled and the time slots are restraining. I can understand the timeslots of cleaning between but it doesnt seem like thats been happening. No one has been SANITIZING between guest visits. Vacuuming isnt sanitizing. At least spray some aresol lysol on some areas if there isnt time to wipe down. Also, there are 3 very large issues that need to be fixed on the equipment and if the managment just inspected it they would see how children could fall through or get hurt. I wont elaborate because id like them to look through all the obstacles and see what im talking about. Id be willing to change ny review if items were properly fixed. My kids havei a good time there but im tired of them gettinf injured there and sick after being there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carly Blackmar\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We use to love this place it was clean and well taken care of. Went back after a year and it’s dirty, run down. Kids still had fun but they were suppose to offer food popcorn or nachos the 2 kids they had running that shift had nothing on. The one bounce house was so low on air my 4 year old almost smacked the ground barely jumping. This place could be a gold mine with better equipment and more stuff. The games were too much money and a few didn’t even work. Definitely will go somewhere else next time it’s a shame.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexie Backer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 1 and 3 year olds LOVE this place!! So much fun and works out a lot of energy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Camryn Holloman\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have been coming to this place for 3 years and absolutely love it. Besides the occasional times my kids have gotten sick, never had many issues. I have my kids birthday parties here. My concern currently is yesterday when we went at the FIRST time slot available; my 5 year old managed to get their leg IN BETWEEN a zip tie that is holding the net to the giant Playset. Another parent had to run up there and help me break the zip tie as my child was suspended in the air.\n\nAdditionally, there was a large hole above the slide that my child thought was funny to try to stick their head through. Obviously I corrected my child. However, this is still a serious safety concern and should be checked CONSTANTLY and addressed asap. Not once a week!\n\nI called the manager the next day who told me once a week someone comes through to check the safety of the net and the playset. She Then proceeded to tell me that the large hole in the net above the slides must’ve occurred the same day because the employees check the nets every night. That is not possible, because we arrived at the very first timeslot that was available that day.\n\nI tried to explain to her that the zip tie was also loose because there’s no possible way my child could have slipped their entire leg through a zip tie in between the foam padding on the side; She continued to say it must’ve happened that day and that the employees are very busy.\n\nMy child is not a small kid. The zip tie had to have been loose. A zip tie that is loose connected to the foam siding can cause a child to slip through the side off the playset, and the only thing holding a child from falling down is that cheap net that the employees supposedly check every night? I think not.\n\nAdditionally, we have a birthday party planned there and I cannot get any refund for the party. I will lose 50% of the funds that I paid so I will continue to have my birthday party there for my child and we just have to ensure that a parent is in there with kids, because the employees do not effectively check the netting for safety. Most of the employees that work there are likely high school or early college kids who genuinely don’t care. It’s just a job to them. Nothing wrong with them personally I was at age once with a job that wasn’t a serious career for me so they genuinely do not care and probably do not check the netting every single night.They are NEVER been too busy the 20 times we’ve been here to check for safety hazards.\n\nMy kids enjoy this place so much so we will likely still attend here and have the birthday party where I can’t get my money back but if you’re a parent you need to make sure you watch your child extreme amount on that place and be up there with them or have an older child who is capable of watching younger kids because your childs safety is at risk on that play set.  And because you sign a waiver, the facility and the employees and manager genuinely don’t appear to care.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Robinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son loves this place!

It’s disgusting inside & needs better cleaning. This place is visually dirty. This place is also known that if you want your kid to get sick, you should come here cause it’s gonna happen.  You can read tons of reviews stating the same thing but the owner still does nothing about it. They also ironically only respond to some of the reviews, but none of the ones stating the issues with the place. If they don’t fix something soon, they’re gonna go out of business. My kids truly enjoyed this place and now we don’t go anymore cause we’re tired of getting sick & tired of the cleanliness so we wish it wasn’t run so poorly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leeza Cruze\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute place.

Scrolling the reviews just now I see another one from 8 months ago where her child also got HFM after going there.\n\nI even wiped my kids hands and faces with wet ones wipes multiple times while we were there. The place isn’t clean or disinfected clearly. There were only a total of 5 other children in there while we were and it’s not like a daycare where you have no choice but to bring your kids there and they’re busy taking care of your children the whole time and may miss cleaning something.

I love that it gives him the opportunity to play, run out energy and socialize, but I do think the play areas could be cleaner. The foam mats are visibly dirty. There is also a play area specifically for younger children (less than 3 years old) and there’s often older children playing rough in that area. While I was there with my almost 2 year old, there were older kids jumping off of the top of the slide while my son was standing at the bottom of it and almost jumped right on him. I love that this is a cheap option to let your kids play, but I wish the rules were enforced more and there was more active supervision between staff and parents.}",

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tasha Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Went on a Friday at 1:30pm and not open.

Website doesn't have https, which has been the standard for nearly a decade & makes my web browser warn me that the site may be dangerous or deceptive - was it put up by a child?? Would be trivial to hijack, zero web security - a quick vuln scan shows it is full of holes and insecure container objects, plugins that are out of date and have open vulnerabilities from CISA. Not much for professionalism, between this and the pictures I think we are going somewhere else. When your website gets hacked, it's because your developer left the door wide open.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lachelle Nelms\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My two year old enjoyed but mostly she was playing on things we pretty much had at the house. We went earlier in the day and I don’t think the place had been cleaned in a few days or longer. Sand and stuff in the ball pits toys in the younger children room area was all over the place! I don’t think it’s worth $15 to be honest the price should be lowered. When dealing with sand and stuff the place needs to be cleaned up often and sanitized. Yes they have sanitizer bottles around but they need someone cleaning daily. My daughter ended up getting  a rash on her arm the next day and I didn’t allow her in the sand only the ball pit area where she wasn’t there long.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evette Nachtigal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Such a fun addition to the Madison community to take little ones! I think this place is just going to grow and get more and more additions to it! Our little one loved it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey Powers\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We took my son here one weekend and fell in love with this cute little indoor play area. It had lots of different centers to choose from. The lady that was working there was very nice and helpful.  I read some reviews complaining about the price, but it's the same as other indoor playgrounds in Huntsville,  and at Sandy Land, you can come and go through out the whole day. The only reason i gave 4 stars is I think it needs to be a bigger place or take out some centers or toys. It felt very crowded. There was only 1 other family there besides us, and the way the rooms are set up, the kids were having a difficult time riding the Ride-on toys and trying not to run over the adults or others toys.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Canhg\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited 3 months ago\nReview: Sandy land is a cute place, you walk inside and there’s a little area for snacks and tables if you want to have lunch, they have snacks for sale as well and allow outside food.\nMy initial impression though is that it’s wildly overpriced. For my 4/1 year old I paid 30$ which I find extremely steep especially when you have let’s play Huntsville with so much more interactive stuff and ways to get the energy out. The blow up ball pit is rough, it’s dirty and clearly used, the sand pit with water was not thought out well, you need to bring extra clothes to this place as the sand room with water gets your kids not only soaked but sandy as hell. I wasn’t prepared for that and my baby was soaking within minutes of playing and then I felt like we had to leave because she was so cold and had wet sand inside her clothes and yeah idk about that situation.\n\nThe owner wasn’t overly friendly and honestly I was just taken back at the initial expense. If they did a 10$ per kid plus 5$ for an additional I could see this place being realistic but the cost for what you get doesn’t match at all. You’ll only really be there maybe 2 hours max and yeah that was my biggest turn off next to the dress up clothes that were all broken and missing pieces. Like if you’re going to charge that much money you want to have a really epic time.\n\nLet’s play Huntsville was way more worth money imo.\n\nNot saying this place doesn’t have potential but meh.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mohammad AL Hassan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We came after diner with my family to jave my 4 years old play. They wanted to charge me for my other two boys 13 and 10 despite the fact that they didn’t want to play.

Lost my business.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe S.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Wow!! Five minutes in and we love this place!

Super safe environment and a judgment free zone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David homolak\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Our kids had a great time here and the staff was very nice and helpful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Garcia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My 2 year old had a great time. We went not long after they opened and found everything clean. We also saw employees wiping toys down/vacuuming/tidying up before we left.\nI feel like the price is a good value especially since they don't charge for adults. It was well worth it and less than we would've paid at similar places.\nRecommend bringing a change of clothes for the water tables.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: very creative place and clean!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chesa Pryor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: The perfect place. The perfect size. Like being at your friends house. I can do my schoolwork, while my kid plays. With only 1 preschooler $15 is doable, especially since he will stay its worth. Bring extra clothes in case your kid plays with the water in the sand room.\nI wish they were opened this past summer! Praying this place stays open for a very long time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ELP SM\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Was not impressed by the cleanliness level and overall safety.\n-Cleanliness: Toys do not appear regularly washed, never mind disinfected. A lot of stains on everything. The blowup ball pit and slide had holes and stains all throughout. The water/sand room was gross and the water appears to not be replaced regularly throughout the day. I appreciated multiple hand sanitizers throughout the building, and vacuuming of stray sand, but overall there are a lot of toys that are in need of replacing.\n-Safety: This is a big one for me. The sand is dusty and appears to not be silica free (through observation alone), which is incredibly toxic and dangerous to any one that breaths it in. They also advertise sanitization through UV light, but I have a hard time believing that/and how that works.\nThere are exposed cords and open wall sockets EVERYWHERE. There is zero baby proofing here, and it was a constant fight to not have my young kids stick their fingers in the outlets. There is an area, specifically by the bubbles and bathroom, that has an open cord storage area that is not blocked off and easily accessible. There is also a glass cabinet with doors that are not locked and kids were exploring in there and getting hurt climbing the glass shelves. It appears to be intended for \"grocery store\" use in the imaginative play section, but doesn't have anything in it and is unnecessary.\n-Lastly, a young girl was there with what appeared to be her pet snake, and was walking around with it showing everyone and offering pets. No harm was meant by this, but it should not be allowed to let anyone have animals in this facility meant for young children playing. People with phobias of snakes, and the liability of having a reptile (not being presented by a professional) in a child play place, was not taken into consideration.\n\nOverall I think this place has potential, but needs a lot of work, especially for the high price of admission. People expect a higher level of entertainment, cleanliness, and most importantly safety, when catering to young children, and this place has not met the mark.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Cecil\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: This place is so neat! My 2 and a half year old didn't want to leave! The people were super friendly. The place was super clean. Definitely worth going!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dalton Eskew\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Sandy land is great and worth the money. $15 for each of my kids was worth them getting 4 hours of fun in their sand with the toys provided.

They are great for kids birthdays!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kennedy Lauren\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: It’s very clean, the owners are very nice and caring 😊 my kids loved it there we will definitely be back soon 😊 …}",

This is the perfect answer to a Mama's prayers! Such a sweet place with great toys for your little ones. It's clean, well designed, comfortable for kiddos and parents. There's a snack bar, an under 3 area that the owner politely and thankfully keeps 'under 3', a place for parties if needed PLUS the best lemonade in town! Please spread the word so this place is around for many years to come!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: brian U\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very cute and clean little place for kids. Great for rainy days or something to get out of the house. *Just a side note for those with chemical sensitivity, it has a very strong smell from febreeze which if you've done your research can be an endocrine disruptor and mess with hormones* My 3 year old had fun though!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hellonurse815\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessie Daniels\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shiloh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael Barrett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place, great to have an inside option for kids to play, and clean and safe.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savannah Carey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love going here.

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy. Tons to do for everyone and accommodates all group ages from babies to teens!

I’m so happy that a worker like Krysten could make my daughter have a memorable experience and one she won’t forget.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy W (Mother of 3)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great for the price. Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog. Very impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yesica Robles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great place for kids !

My 2 year old had a blast!! All the staff is fantastic, but Francine was AMAZING!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalie Mays\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing. The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy.

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

Such a nice indoor play place for kids of all ages! There is a nice little section for kids under 3, so they are sectioned off and can play freely in their own area while it still being open for parents to see bigger kids play as well! We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it! All of the staff is super friendly and attentive! We always have a great time here! I also had a question for management and they handled in such a friendly way. Let this be your sign to take your kids for a fun play date!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Kinder\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love playing here.

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kambrianna Norton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We recently had a birthday party here and it was fantastic! Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy.

Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog.

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it! All of the staff is super friendly and attentive! We always have a great time here! I also had a question for management and they handled in such a friendly way.

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy.

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Quiroz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday party at Plum Krazy and it was amazing.

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

Housing\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Our kids love this place and always have so much fun when they come in.  Our negative experience comes from their lack of empathy regarding the needs of children.  We brought our two kids and 3 friends today to enjoy the teacher workday.  The kids knew that they have pizza there and wanted to eat when we got there.  About 15 minutes after getting there, we went and asked for a cheese pizza and were told they were out.  She was very nice and said she would order more.  She called dominos and was told it would be at least an hour and a half for it to be delivered.  I asked her if we could pick it up and she said no due to health concerns it needs to be delivered?  I then asked if we could leave and get something to eat and come back to which we were told if we left the parking lot our tickets were void!!!!   We waited over two hours and still no pizza and very hungry kids.  If you are not going to allow outside food, then you need to have inside food available for purchase.  It’s that simple.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We celebrated my daughter’s 4th birthday at Jumpin Jax using the weekday after-hours package for 10 kids. Christine was very informative and communicated in a kind, professional and efficient manner. Sara was our party host and she was fabulous! She met all of our needs right on time. Everything was ready for us, all we had to do was bring the cake and the party! We did the glow party add-on and it was an excellent twist on the evening. Kids had a real blast and the party was huge success! Highly recommend this place for a convenient, low-hassle, low-stress birthday celebration.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Prudence VanTilburg\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5 star review of JumpinJax!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lynn Dawley\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Thank you for your 4-star rating, Lynn!

A last minute birthday party turned out like we spent forever planning it.\n\nFor parents considering hosting a party here or just bringing your child to play, it’s worth it! And honestly, an even better price than other indoor play spots within 50 miles.\n\nSuper clean facility.\nFriendly staff.\nPlenty of fun for kids of all ages.\nWell organized.\nSpacious and most important, FUN!\n\nWe especially loved the fact we could feel safe letting our 2 year old run and play freely.\n\nSpecial shout out to our party host again. Gracen was funny, kind, and kept our party going. She stayed ahead of our every need and had things ready go. We didn’t need to ask for a thing.

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.

But I was very disappointed to see the lack of care from the staff. There were teenagers or very young adults playing rough and jumping on the trampoline. I was surprised they didn't break them on how they were jumping. The staff didn't do anything to inforce rules.\nI was very impressed with the size of the party room. I'm not sure if I will be back.

The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting — sewer water was overflowing and actually leaking into the play area, which is a major health concern. Had we not already paid to play, I would have walked out. The entire facility felt unclean and poorly maintained. I paid $24 expecting a fun, safe environment for my kids, but it felt like a complete waste of money. We left within 20 minutes of our play time and we won’t be coming back. Megaplay seriously needs to address these issues.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Richard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: At 12:15 we are told that we can't enter with our 3 year old because \"the current playtime is about to end and the next one doesn't start until 12:45\". There ONE child currently in there playing. ONE! There are two parents with him. So, there are literally twice as many parents, including the staff, three times as many adults as children here. Still, our child can't come in, and we can't wait inside either for some odd reason. \"You have to come back at 12:45\" we are told. I point out the ONE child thing. Nope, come back at 12:45. I'm informed these rules \"are strictly enforced and have been since covid\". So, I asked \"why have we not been turned away and told to come back at a designated time the last THREE times are three year old randomly decided she wanted to go there\"? With a straight face, the girl behind the counter tells me, \"well, it depends on who the staff members are that are that are working that day as to if the 'rules are enforced'\". Have you ever tried to explain to a three year old, who's now throwing a fit because she can't play, that she has to go somewhere else and can't play because the wrong staff member is working that day? One last try. \"Ma'am, there's one other kid in here, she's all excited to play, no one has ever mentioned this to us before\".  Nope, come back at 12:45. ONE kid! I have no problems with there being rules. I do have a problem that only ONE staff member chooses to enforce them or even make them known. I do have a problem that we were allowed to pay and play three previous times and out of the 5 maybe 6 other staff members we've met, none of them ever mentioned these \"strictly enforced\" rules.\nTLDR;\n1)Whether or not your child can play without an appointment in a building with ONE other child, COMPLETELY depends on which staff members are working that day.\n2)We did NOT return at 12:45\n3)You are not allowed to use the restroom to change a toddlers diaper unless you pay. You can't pay until 12:45.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Craig Vincent\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It's a fun enough place for what it is.\n\nGreat way to spend 90mins and let your kids tire themselves out while having fun.\n\nThe kids play area is engaging for toddlers and there are two pretty cool bounce houses\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It was pretty cheap, nice to play to go on a rainy day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey Vincent\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This was B U L L S H I T\nBULLSHIT.

I booked the party room for my daughter’s birthday party and when we arrived…. It was a TOTALLY different theme. All of the guests were in mini mouse attire and the room was decorated with Moana. I was so embarrassed. The staff went to the back and found 1 pack of mini mouse plates and 2 pack of napkins and offered to “decorate” with those items. They offered to refund me the $30 for decorations and a refund for the 3 EXTRA PIZZAS(that i did not order) to my reservation. Nothing could replace the special day that we were all looking forward to. Also the employees rushed us out of the party room smh.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hello Shneighther\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My baby sister turned 4 today and we decided to take her to play.  she's afraid of the high slides so she wanted to stay and play where the 3 year old play one of the works came up to us and told us that the manager Katy told us she couldn't play there and that if we didn't leave she would call the cops on us. I thought it was very disrespectful and stupid how she said she would call the cops on us because our kid didn't want to play in the big slides. Me and my family are never going back to that dirty place. Mind you it was empty there was only two families there and my family was on of them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alasia Medina\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Good morning, I am formally filing a complaint against the Jacksonville, North Carolina Megaplay location. I took my daughter to megaplay early January around 11:30  when I was told from an employee to come back\nIn 15 minutes as there where three parties going on. My daughter and I then proceeded to wait the 15 minutes which it is now 11:45, come back as to where I was greeted by another employee who stated they have reached the maximum capacity and I could not check my daughter in to play until 5pm at night which was an enormous inconvenience for myself and my 5 year old daughter who was in tears leaving as I had to explain to her that she could not play. I cannot understand how this kind of business can accept employees that toy with children’s emotions like that. And I will post this review on every social media platform so they know the kind of standard that is being held at the Megaplay Jacksonville, North Carolina location. What a disgrace. Zero stars if I could.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Lawrence\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: 3 stars due to cost and needed maintenance and upkeep.\n\nMy daughter (3 years old) absolutely loves Megaplay. She has more fun here than she does at Zing Zumm and Altitute, both of which we have memberships for.\n\nThat said, I think Megaplay is prohibitively expensive as a place to take my daughter. Zing is $100 for an entire year, and for her and I to jump at Altitude 7 days a week for 2 hours at a time it's $40 a month. At Mega, there is no monthly option, so taking her just 3 times a month is as expensive as Altitude unlimited visits.\n\nCan we get a membership option like everywhere else?\n\nAs for maintenance, the junglejims have many spots missing padding, covered in duct tape, equipment removed likely due to damage. The bounce houses have airleaks and tape all over.\n\nI'm not posting this to bash, we really love it and would really love if we could go more often and see some much needed repairs. Thank you and please think about it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Eric Smith\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Well after booking we didn't get to go because it was closed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lakysha Neal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I bring my girls every weekend and they love it and have so much fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: megan bryan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Came for a birthday party and it was a fun clean environment. Will be returning. Fun for all ages\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Nicole\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Just wanted to share what could’ve been a scary situation. I took my kids here because it’s always a great time and my youngest is almost 3 years old. He was in the big jungle gym and I was with him. Well another kid bulldozed into him (not so mad about that bc kids will be kids) what I was and am furious about is the fact that he almost fell from almost the ceiling height to the ground level on the ground. If I wasn’t there he would’ve 100% fell to the ground from up there.\nPictured below is the netting he was gripping onto before the incident happened. When he fell from another kid running into him he was completely under the netting except for his head, I pulled him up immediately and I checked to see if I was being dramatic or not and I was in fact not being dramatic. The net was completely open and any child would have fallen to the ground especially smaller children. This is not safe and should be better handled. Fix this so it doesn’t happen again or worse.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evangeline Jones\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: On 11/15/2024 at approximately 10:02AM My son & I visited Mega play's Center. I am writing this review to raise awareness about discrimination faced by children with developmental delays during playtime. Office Manager of Megaplay left her office door open leaving a safety hazard to all children in this establishment my son entered her office to play on her play rug and we were verbally attacked by this Manager screaming for us to \"get out of her office\". I immediately attempted to explain my son is Autistic and this door should be closed. We were kicked out and I asked for a refund before I would leave. The Manager did grant this refund while speaking in a tone and demeanor not professional or fit for any type of leadership. As per the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which ensures disabled children have equal access to play and recreational activities my sons experience suggests that such principles were not upheld.  On behalf of my son, I would like to emphasize the need for this environment to become more nurturing and increase the ability for children to be able to thrive here. I am disappointed in my experience both women in this business lacked professionalism. maturity, and the ability to run an establishment properly by using conflict resolution this is a vulnerable child. You kicked him out because he entered your office and then screamed at a parent? I'm mortified...I ask anyone in this community don't allow your children to be treated like this. This business is unsafe, and follow-up will be taken to determine ratio per employees, cleanliness, and overall ability to operate properly. Staff training and creating a more inclusive environment should be required for this establishment to continue to operate.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Ferguson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The set play times make no sense since it is never busy. You cant get your full hour and a half unless you get there at the right time. It’s way too expensive to not get the full time. Also had an older sibling go into the toddler area to help my toddler get off something and she was told to get out she wasn't playing in the area just helping her sibling quickly so i don't understand that either. They’re loosing money with the set play times I saw plenty of people come in and then leave because they’re told the next play time starts in 45 minutes or whatever. Dont waste your money just go to altitude\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Tinsley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: 2 stars.

Needless to say we were very disappointed, it looked very grungy and not cleaned, the padding needs to be replaced in several areas . The toddler area was very small but yet limited, will be glad when the Spring Lake location is opened back up\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelynn Burnett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We rented the party room at Megaplay for my daughter’s 7th birthday this year. I am someone who really struggle with perfectionism and people pleasing. Thanks to this, party planning means a lot of stress for me. The folks at Megaplay were so kind and accommodating from the first moment I called. They had no problem answering every question I had before booking the room. They also explained clearly the fees and accommodations. In addition, they never made me feel uncomfortable or like an inconvenience for needing more clarification or for asking a second or third time. They also confirmed my time slot and accommodations twice before the date of the party. They made it clear they would do all the decorating all I had to do was drop off my supplies, and there was even an option to have them go buy the supplies for you (for an additional charge.)\n\nAll of that is great alone, but the staff really went above and beyond to support me. My daughter woke up sick the day of her party and I frantically called crying and defeated that everything was ruined. Not only did Megaplay have no problem rescheduling me, but the staff went out of there way to offer me reassurance and support that everything would be okay. Not as a customer, but as a stressed out mom thinking way too hard about a pokemon party. The reschedule affected the guest turnout pretty badly and I was fretting around in circles most of the party. Josh and Joyanna were right there for me the entire time. They checked with me every few minutes to make sure I was doing okay. They let me take the reins wherever I felt comfortable, but had no probably helping me direct the flow of the party in my stressed out state. I cannot count the number of times they told me “if you need anything at all please don’t hesitate to let us know.”\n\nThe sincerity of the staff at Megaplay made every difference in the world for me. Thank you so much to Josh and Joyanna for having next level customer support. It was so clear my experience mattered to them as a person not just a customer. They were really able to help turn my entire mood about the party around. I’m so grateful this is where we chose to celebrate and I would give more stars if I could. ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Higdon\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Came here with family visiting. It was very empty, felt very dirty. As we were sitting and watching our children play, we seen the staff standing on tables to decorate for the party the next day, never cleaned the table off, wearing dirty shoes where families place their food at for their parties. When we had the teenagers helping the toddlers in the toddle area, the workers played the voice over saying they weren’t allowed to be in there, yet no one was in the building other than us & we were sitting next to them… but instead of being nice & polite they rudely continued to play the sound seeing that the teenagers were just helping.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this place. It was my first time there and I would never bring my family back or myself. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Taillon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Shepard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicola Gerber\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: They offer a military discount which is appreciated. But you have to come during the certain play times, so prepare. Then we asked to use the bumper cars and were informed since it is within 30 minutes of ending playtime it is closed. It would have been nice to know about it closing when we came in.\nThe large obstacle blow up had a hole where my 10 year old son's leg fell in, we reported it. It could be very dangerous for a small child who could fall all the way in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Bowling\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This is always so fun for the kids to play, and the prices are incredible!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Birgit Fuller\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Took grandkids but had to leave a after about 1 hr since it was uncomfortably warm inside the building and with all the kids running and playing it made it uncomfortable to say the least\nSomewhat dissapointed\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Riley Wagner\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place DESPERATELY needs a revamp.\nHere now with my kiddos and all the bounce houses go straight to the floor when you step in!

They decided to turn off the inflatable with my son in it even though they knew he was in there, and even saw us standing at the end of it trying to get him to come out of it. I reached out and asked for management but never heard back. Then my son asked to go again on his birthday on the 20th and we took him. We were super surprised to find that it was absolutely disgusting on the inside. All the inflatables hardly held my 29lb daughter and were all taped but still leaking air. The bridge at the top of the play place had a screw that was barely holding on and was bent. Then when I went to the front desk to buy drinks for my kids I could not find the lady that was up there till my fiancé pointed out that you could see the top of her head as she was sitting down below the counter on her phone. I tried getting her attention said hello and excuse me, but it wasn’t till the phone rang that she got up a couple minutes later. It really does suck because my kids love it here but now we gotta find a new place to take them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Wangard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Not worth the money in my opinion.

During covid, they were on top of keeping it pretty clean. They stopped play time every hour to walk through and sanitize.  The equipment has always been a bit worn out, but this last visit, I was blown away. They have let this place go all the way downhill. 2 days after visiting this place, my son came down with a high-grade fever.\n\nWhen we first arrived, the only thing I noticed was how HOT and muggy it was inside. Smelled like moldy gym socks. My son was too excited to turn back, so we continued.  My son is only 40 pounds, and he was the only child in the whole building. The bounce house he first picked could barely stay inflated with just him on it. Lots of holes and tape to patch these inflatables up.  And dirt. Lots and lots of dirt.\n\nIn the jungle gym maze part, there is pure filth. Candy wrappers, dirt,  drippings of God know what, and HAIR EVERYWHERE.  Lots of spots in the maze need to be fixed properly before someone gets seriously hurt. DUCT TAPE DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING.  Mind you, we were the first ones there for the day.  So surely there were plenty of hours to clean before the next batch of children came in. There are signs all over saying, \" If your child shows any sign of being sick, please inform the staff immediately.\"  Well, it's 2 days later, my son is very sick, and the only place we were was mega play.\n\nI understand that businesses are short staffed, and I will say that the only girl working in there was very kind..... but this filth is absolutely unacceptable at a childs play place.  They charge 12 dollars for one hour. Not worth it at all. I will never ever bring my son back to mega play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jeffrey andre\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Papas play ground\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Seth Lauzon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Granddaughter had an absolute blast playing on everything.

And well worth all of the money spent.\n\nThis place was wonderful for our son’s 5th birthday party. Our son got to experience another kid’s birthday party held here last year and loved it so much, he asked to come back and have his birthday here this time.\n\nJust like last time, the tables were already set up, the room was already prepared for all of the parents and the kids. Literally all we had to do was bring our son and his birthday cake (with utensils).\n\nIf I could change anything at all, I’d want:\n-Help facilitating the pizza-cake-opening presents thing for parents/people who haven’t hosted a party before. Or a reference source offered at the time of the party.\n-Designated birthday seat for the birthday kid at the furthest end of the table.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Helen Guy\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It was horrible.bought token just to find out All the games were out of order.nothimg for the 3 or 1 year old to do.This place is a r ipe off\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya Juarbe\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Mega disappointment\n\nI've been bringing my family and friends to this establishment for a while now, so it’s disappointing to see that little to no repairs or maintenance is ever done whenever we revisit.  It’s very frustrating to see all the out-of-order signs and dirty mats my children are provided to play on. This visit was the most disappointing due to my son's favorite ride being out of order once again on our latest visit. I would assume with the price of entry; it should be sufficient enough for maintenance and replacements of mats and balls for the ball pit. As a frequent customer, I am pretty upset with the lack of care and upkeep of this indoor playground.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cadence Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: love this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juan Yanez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Horrible !!!

Didn't pay for the room but we had my two year olds birthday party there yesterday! Bathrooms worked, they had drinks to sell and yes it was a little \"dirty\"(ware and tare) but I think that would happen anywhere kids play all day, everyday. All together we had a great time and my children had a blast!! Thanks mega play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elsie Webster\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Id give a 5 star for 2019 serivce... For 2024 its a 2. The price has doubled and the time slots are restraining. I can understand the timeslots of cleaning between but it doesnt seem like thats been happening. No one has been SANITIZING between guest visits. Vacuuming isnt sanitizing. At least spray some aresol lysol on some areas if there isnt time to wipe down. Also, there are 3 very large issues that need to be fixed on the equipment and if the managment just inspected it they would see how children could fall through or get hurt. I wont elaborate because id like them to look through all the obstacles and see what im talking about. Id be willing to change ny review if items were properly fixed. My kids havei a good time there but im tired of them gettinf injured there and sick after being there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carly Blackmar\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We use to love this place it was clean and well taken care of. Went back after a year and it’s dirty, run down. Kids still had fun but they were suppose to offer food popcorn or nachos the 2 kids they had running that shift had nothing on. The one bounce house was so low on air my 4 year old almost smacked the ground barely jumping. This place could be a gold mine with better equipment and more stuff. The games were too much money and a few didn’t even work. Definitely will go somewhere else next time it’s a shame.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexie Backer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 1 and 3 year olds LOVE this place!! So much fun and works out a lot of energy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Camryn Holloman\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have been coming to this place for 3 years and absolutely love it. Besides the occasional times my kids have gotten sick, never had many issues. I have my kids birthday parties here. My concern currently is yesterday when we went at the FIRST time slot available; my 5 year old managed to get their leg IN BETWEEN a zip tie that is holding the net to the giant Playset. Another parent had to run up there and help me break the zip tie as my child was suspended in the air.\n\nAdditionally, there was a large hole above the slide that my child thought was funny to try to stick their head through. Obviously I corrected my child. However, this is still a serious safety concern and should be checked CONSTANTLY and addressed asap. Not once a week!\n\nI called the manager the next day who told me once a week someone comes through to check the safety of the net and the playset. She Then proceeded to tell me that the large hole in the net above the slides must’ve occurred the same day because the employees check the nets every night. That is not possible, because we arrived at the very first timeslot that was available that day.\n\nI tried to explain to her that the zip tie was also loose because there’s no possible way my child could have slipped their entire leg through a zip tie in between the foam padding on the side; She continued to say it must’ve happened that day and that the employees are very busy.\n\nMy child is not a small kid. The zip tie had to have been loose. A zip tie that is loose connected to the foam siding can cause a child to slip through the side off the playset, and the only thing holding a child from falling down is that cheap net that the employees supposedly check every night? I think not.\n\nAdditionally, we have a birthday party planned there and I cannot get any refund for the party. I will lose 50% of the funds that I paid so I will continue to have my birthday party there for my child and we just have to ensure that a parent is in there with kids, because the employees do not effectively check the netting for safety. Most of the employees that work there are likely high school or early college kids who genuinely don’t care. It’s just a job to them. Nothing wrong with them personally I was at age once with a job that wasn’t a serious career for me so they genuinely do not care and probably do not check the netting every single night.They are NEVER been too busy the 20 times we’ve been here to check for safety hazards.\n\nMy kids enjoy this place so much so we will likely still attend here and have the birthday party where I can’t get my money back but if you’re a parent you need to make sure you watch your child extreme amount on that place and be up there with them or have an older child who is capable of watching younger kids because your childs safety is at risk on that play set.  And because you sign a waiver, the facility and the employees and manager genuinely don’t appear to care.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Robinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son loves this place!

We arrived at 1020am paid full price til 1130am because that is the time slots. Customer service stated that it's \"posted everywhere.\" It's 2 8x10 papers.  One in the door and one on the inside.

Todays trip was a total waste of money because we had to leave 30 minutes into our play time to go find a bathroom.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cathy Brinson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Children just wanna have fun....\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alemnesh Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I used to work here, and I loved it then.

Keep up the fantastic work!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kenna Lemon\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: They had choking hazards( half of Easter eggs) in the baby ball pit and employees watched as about 6 older kids throwing things  and pushing down babies in the baby area . They all stood there and not once tried to stop it one even walked by as these kids were chucking balls at people and the babies!!. They stood there  talking instead of doing their jobs. If you have a baby or toddler do not bring your baby here !!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mr Erny\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun place for kids. Lots of blow up areas. There is a three story playset with slides and obstacles. They have a few party rooms for rent.  The only downside is I've started to notice more and more games that cost money/tokens. I get it... but still a bummer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Miner\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The concept of this place is awesome but so poorly executed. It’s disgusting inside & needs better cleaning. This place is visually dirty. This place is also known that if you want your kid to get sick, you should come here cause it’s gonna happen.  You can read tons of reviews stating the same thing but the owner still does nothing about it. They also ironically only respond to some of the reviews, but none of the ones stating the issues with the place. If they don’t fix something soon, they’re gonna go out of business. My kids truly enjoyed this place and now we don’t go anymore cause we’re tired of getting sick & tired of the cleanliness so we wish it wasn’t run so poorly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leeza Cruze\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute place. Definitely more catered for under 5 year olds. Even tho they said 12 and under, I'd recommend 6 and under.

It took me a little to even think of where they could’ve gotten it from and this is the only place we went that’s remotely a possibility. Scrolling the reviews just now I see another one from 8 months ago where her child also got HFM after going there.\n\nI even wiped my kids hands and faces with wet ones wipes multiple times while we were there. The place isn’t clean or disinfected clearly. There were only a total of 5 other children in there while we were and it’s not like a daycare where you have no choice but to bring your kids there and they’re busy taking care of your children the whole time and may miss cleaning something. The employees could be sanitizing things during the loads of downtime they have.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D.N D.N\nRating: 2/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: During the pandemic I caught covid here.

Sometimes they are not taking walks in because they short staff or an event going on. They closed early too without previous notice.\n\nAlso, besides trash there's dead cockroaches around they big play area🥴\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jackson Lafferty\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Absolutely horrible. 400$ for my daughters birthday to be ruined. The pizza came with about 5 minutes to spare, the place was so dirty, things kept going missing from the guests we invited to her birthday party. A random child ran in the room and dug his hands in the birthday cake. Nothing was done or said. We were so rushed the entire time, then the best part. My mother was actually kicked out for \"complaining too loudly\" to the 16 year old manager. She then proceeded to kick out my crying 11 year old daughter on her birthday. This place needs to be shut down.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maxwell Matos\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: A little fun place for the kids. Adults are free which is nice.

For the price you pay for a Birthday Party ( $300.00 ). I have attended my granddaughter’s and a friend”s little girl’s party. And for what price is charged for an hour and a half for the service you receive is absolutely ridiculous. So if you like being rushed this is the perfect place. But if you want your children to have fun and enjoy then I wouldn’t recommend this place. Rude and unprofessional.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: michelle bates\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place used to be clean and fun for the kids. Today, it was dirty and run down. It was unsafe for my younger kids, as there was tiny pieces of styrofoam all over the floor in the play areas. While we were there a little girl fell under the big slides area and left bleeding from her nose and mouth. We have been here many times in the past and thrown several birthday parties here. Needless to say we will not be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We love this place!

We use them for their drop-off childcare. Everyone that works there is extremely nice and dedicated to making sure the kiddos are having fun. We love the arcade games as well as the play structures. There's even a spot for babies and small toddlers to enjoy. Mega Play is the perfect place for families and for your little ones to wear themselves out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alisha Hill\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Worst Experience Ever!!!\n\nI am very angry at this place of business because when we first got to this place we started late because the pizza's was late and then we was kicked out so fast they have people standing over you like you are babies cleaning up the host did nothing at all tell me what did we pay for we paid for 1:30 in a stone small place nothing promised me and my guess was so displeased everyone talked about the serviced that we did not get I will never come to place for anything not even for my child to play games. I am just disappointed and disgusted at the business and i feel robbed of my hard earned money period and will never come to this place again nor tell anyone to go I will tell them to run!!!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kyle j\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Nice place for younger kids. Small arcade area. Couple of different inflatable areas and a budget jungle gym area. Normally pretty clean and friendly staff. Kids can earn tickets and spend them on prizes\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alise Emmert\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I’ve brought my toddler here twice so far. I love that it gives him the opportunity to play, run out energy and socialize, but I do think the play areas could be cleaner. The foam mats are visibly dirty. There is also a play area specifically for younger children (less than 3 years old) and there’s often older children playing rough in that area. While I was there with my almost 2 year old, there were older kids jumping off of the top of the slide while my son was standing at the bottom of it and almost jumped right on him. I love that this is a cheap option to let your kids play, but I wish the rules were enforced more and there was more active supervision between staff and parents.}",

So many things for littles to do, so clean, and so much fun! It’s similar to children’s museums, but small enough that you don’t have to hover and follow your little ones everywhere. You can keep your eyes on them no matter where they are playing. It’s super open - which is really really nice and cuts down on anxiety, especially if you have multiples. I’ve wished for somewhere like this for years. Burlington is lucky to have this gem. 🤩\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany White\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Extremely clean and organized.

I was able to sit with the baby while my 3 year old safely ran around. It's big enough for older kids/toddlers to run but small enough so you don't have to follow and you can always see them. Would be a good spot for working while kids play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ami greene\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Omg loved it, it is  so beautiful and perfect for the lil kiddos and the lady up front was so sweet I will definitely be back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Talea Eiserman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Love this place! Fantastic for those rainy days when kiddos can’t play outside. Owner is friendly and so good with kids. Can’t wait to come back. Great addition to Burlington!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: N W\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Wow, what a great place to take young children to play! There are so many different areas for them to explore! Everything is beautifully decorated! If parents want to get some work done while their children are playing, there's an area with tables that they can sit at. There are several other seating areas for parents to relax. There is a huge party space in the back! There is even a cafe area where snacks will be sold!}",

I took my 1.5 year old today for the first time. Daycare was closed this week due to the holidays, so this was a wonderful opportunity to burn some energy. $15 for two hours that we reserved in advance was well worth the price.

All the kids had so much fun it was truly worth it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tristen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My 21 month old had so much fun here today!

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff is very nice, layout is wonderful and super clean.

The staff is friendly and helpful and the play area and birthday room were incredibly clean. The kids had so much fun and there was something for all - a great variety for our group of ages ranging from baby to 6 years old. It was nice to have the pizza and drinks included in the package so there was no worrying about that. I would recommend this to anyone with young kids! We’re already planning to come back during regular hours and meet up with friends so the kids can play even more!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lee Cuningham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My toddlers had a blast here this past week.

They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Eubanks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great space!

My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay.

The highlights for my girls were; the ball pit/slide, the kid cafe, the spin tops, and the big middle slide. While seated I did see numerous employees sweeping, wiping tables, and checking the bathrooms. My husband and I enjoyed the sweets they had to offer. We tried a crepe and the Oreo waffle, they both were good!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexie Love\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Bocklett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great birthday party!!

As adults we were really uncomfortable as one of the staff literally watched our kids and said something to them every time they did anything but he wouldn't say anything to any of the other kids not following rule. He would literally walk past them to come say something to my son and nephew. I found this odd as we were the only black family there.  I probably won't go back. It is fun for kids but not for my kind of people....\n\nAs I stated yesterday we were made aware and the kids only went in there once. There were tons of other kids at the same age but of a different race in the toddler area and the guy seen them. He only said something to our children because we were the only black family. And to keep from taking ownership someone who wasnt even there gets on here and tries to paint my children as the bad guy but wont tell you how my children helped the guy clean up as the other children played wild and out of control. My son also had another child flip him the bird. Parents bring their kids here and don't pay any attention once they get there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: The kids thoroughly enjoyed the play area and ran around for nearly two hours straight.

A worker came up to us, while we’re actively playing, and told us that we needed to stop because he is “spinning too fast and looks like he’s going to start gagging and be sick!” Okay, while I appreciate the “concern” I know my child, I’m actively playing with my 3yr old who LOVES spinning and sensory play. I could understand if my son was screaming, crying or standing up while spinning.. something OTHER THAN laughing and asking and signing for “more spinning”.. He begged me to spin him more after something was said and I had to explain to him that “mommy can’t spin you anymore” he got so upset he asked to go home.. He is THREE!! A three year old, or any child, should not have experience discrimination..I have friends who have had similar experiences with their children whom aren’t neurotypical.. This place is NOT inclusive for those with intellectual disabilities and I will be filing a formal complaint.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather Baker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 8 months ago\nReview: Super fun place with a chill staff. We didn't have to buy their socks. I didn't feel like they were breathing down our necks about every tiny infraction of the rules. I felt like my toddler could be a toddler and just have fun. He didn't run wild but he climbed up the slide once or twice and didn't get yelled at. We've been back and will go back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris Roach\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: It can be a challenge sometimes to find something all your children will enjoy.

I informed an employee, he came over and did one check. As soon as he walked away it was swarmed again. We gave up and left with a refund. The front desk worker said, “parents need to watch their kids”.

I look forward to making this a stop each time that we travel to this area. Very highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: George Washington\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Its nice.  The hours are so restrictive that its nearly impossible to find them open now.  Also pricey for what you get. If you don't mind traveling there are better options with better hours for the price.  Is nice to have something local to Nashville.  Just wish they could find a way to help it open throughout the week and throughout the day so I can bring the kids there when needed.  Essentially for private events now since they are hardly ever open to the public.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kailen Elizabeth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids always have so much fun here.

They have 4 rooms for parties that seem to be a good size and a large area at the front with a lot of tables for both kids and adults to use. Tons of climbing areas, a ball pit, trampolines etc for kids to choose from. My daughter loves the carousel swing while my son's favorite is the trampoline area. There are a couple spots with big screen tvs that play kid-safe/friendly shows too.

However, it has issues. First of all the food/kitchen menu is basically fake. In theory, they serve both coffee and hot food, but in reality, there's never actually staff to prepare it. I've been here 10+ times. Just don't expect any food except packaged snacks.\n\nSecondly, why is there a huge movie screen playing cartoons??? Who thought this was a good idea at a playgym? If I wanted my toddler to sit and watch Disney movies, we do that at home for free.\n\nToo bad for these poor management decisions. High Five could be great! But right now there is zero reason to visit when you can drive 10m down Independence & go to Playland instead.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cintya Calix\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: s jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Great birthday party location.

They do, however, need to work on logistics. We arrived 30 minutes before start time and they said we needed to wait until 15-20 minutes prior—no problem. The email stated we’d have a room attendant which we did not have. No grip socks included for my party guests. The food came and no one announced or told us it was there so by the time the kids got to it—it was cooling off. The same happened with their sweet treats at the end. No announcement, no notifying the parents—just dropped it off to melt and walked off. The only time someone came and communicated directly with me was at the end when they wanted me to check out and pay them. For the prices they charge they should be way more accommodating to families hosting parties. If you’re going just for kids to play 6 and under it’s a good option with accessibility for the smaller kids. I’ve hosted multiple kids parties and this was the least impressive experience on that front.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Michel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristal King\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great spot for kids! We went recently for a 2 yr olds birthday party and everyone has a good time. There's something to do for kids of pretty much all ages... my 18 month old enjoyed herself just as much of my 9 year old. It can be a little chaotic as kids can run around independently while parents can choose to watch from the sidelines. So you just have to be extra watchful of the smaller kids to make sure the bigger ones dont run them over. The location would have been hard to find of the party host didnt specifically tell everyone it was behind the At Home store, because if you simply type the address in the GPS you would end up at the front door of the At Home store. Overall it was a great time, I would visit again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jana Swift\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great for my 10 year old and my 18 month old.

However when you book a party (which is very expensive)they expect you and all your guests to be out of the entire facility in the two hour window. They also failed to put the correct amount of chairs knowing the number of guests that had signed in about an hour prior to seat for pizza and cake. The number of chairs was not updated in time. One of my guests felt left out because they took a long time to bring the chair and the little one stepped out crying. It was not a fun experience for my guest and I’m very unhappy about that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Nnene Okeiyi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Great birthday experience for the kiddos.

Large spaces, tons of slides, ball pits, trampolines. Took off a star because it was freezing! All parents were wearing jackets, our kids’ hands and feet were cold. Granted I went soon after they opened and it is a very large space , however  someone should get there earlier and make sure the place is appropriately heated before opening. I paid for 2 hours, but ended up leaving after the first unfortunately because of the cold. We will be back on a warmer day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thornheezy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Good time for both my kids (age 3 and 6).

It was very clean as well as we saw multiple employees cleaning while we were playing! Definitely will be coming back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cassandra Freitas\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Not worth the money 👎🏻 biased because I’ve been to other indoor playgrounds, and this was most definitely at the bottom of my list. Parents aren’t allowed to go down the beautiful big slide they have and that really threw me for a loop since my child wanted to go down together. There was also paper signs multiple places saying that adults couldn’t go on or use areas as well as other paper signs to not lean on furniture etc. This just tells me you bought cheap furniture but charge an expensive price to get through the door. Not to mention, the cafe was not stocked with any food or snacks in the cases and when asked for a cup of coffee well over an hour before their closing time, we had been told the machine was already shut down for the day. They only offer 2 hour passes and within 30 minutes of not being able to join my toddler on things, we were ready to go but stayed since we had already paid for it. I’m sure people enjoy it here but in my opinion, spend your money elsewhere. The place was also clean, which was nice. The gate at the front had been left open a couple times and had to keep redirecting my toddler to not run away.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cynthia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: They keep it clean\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DA Bhatt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Nice place to have a birthday party or just day out for toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bill Hawks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place was incredible for my 2 year old daughter. I’d say it’s a perfect indoor play area for kids under 7 years old. They had equipment for balancing, climbing obstacles, swinging and rotating equipment, tiny trampolines, ball pits, and a really cool jungle gym with three slides. Everything is soft sided so you can feel good about kids trying new things without getting hurt. Didn’t try any food or anything, but was impressed with how much my kid enjoyed it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen van Bergen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mack Mizzle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Beautiful place for toddlers and little kids to play and explore\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yasiel Barroso\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: The playground boasts vibrant colors, clean, well-maintained, and modern equipment, ensuring fun and safety.

Definitely recommended for a family weekend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Iyana Rushing\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Nice place to play for toddlers, not worth $20 though. I’d also examine the ball pits while your child is in it. There was a huge living spider in the smaller ball pit for 2 and under it looked like, luckily my 2year old seen it and notified me before anyone was bitten. Hopefully they clean out the ball pits regularly to make sure there aren’t any insects living beneath.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vivian Pan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: The environment is OK, but don't use the vending machine in the store, when you pay no product comes out.

My children are 1 year and 4 years old. Both kids had a great time. The playground was built in such a way that I could always visually make sure that everything was fine with my eldest and that she was having a great time, while I stayed close to my youngest daughter the whole time. Clean, beautiful, lots of fun for children. For two children it turned out to be about $35 for 2 hours, which is above average, but the day was cloudy, and most importantly the daughters had a great time.\n\nYou can book your time online, but it is not necessary. The first time I booked, the subsequent ones came simply when they wanted to play. But in the second case, it is worth considering that if the site is overcrowded, you may be refused, which has never happened to us.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Jennerich\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Pretty cool place for kids. Plentybof space for a party or if you just bring one child. There are ball pits, slides, mazes, and other things to climb. There is an area for smaller toddlers to play as well. Every surface is soft so no problem if anyone falls down. They have 4 private birthday rooms. Grownups are allowed to play too. They just can't go on the trampolines or slides.I recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: IURII ORLOV\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Super👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️ …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: bobbie Berke\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Ridiculously cold (manager says it’s set at 68).

We had a blast! We went around 4PM on a Friday. Everything was clean. Even made me more excited to see people actively cleaning as we were playing. The only reason I took off one star is because the price is a bit steep for a 2 hour playtime. I only brought one of my two kids but I can’t imagine a family paying for more than 2 kids. This place is definitely geared to kids 10 and under. They have little baby sections for little ones to play on. Socks are required which is great! Hand sanitizer stations posted everywhere and lots of spaces for parents to sit out and chill. Even a place for parents who need to charge their phones, use their computers, or even moms to plug up to pump. They also have a cafe that serves food. We were going out to eat afterwards so we didn’t get to use those services. It overall we enjoyed and though the price is higher than others, we will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Noel\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The establishment is clean, and maintained well, it was not very busy today which was nice,   Removed stars for not having any saftey measures for kids leaving with correct adults and the gate to the exit was not consistently shut either and the front door wouldn’t completely shut either   … when we got here it was so hot inside everyone was sweating even people sitting down- I personally bumped the ac to a comfortable level bc no employees were… overpriced, (15 min down the road I can pay half of what I pay for 1 here )-  the food options are not healthy at all,   And there are tvs in multiple spots ….  Which for some would be a  non issue but for people bringing kids who are screen free the kids just stare at the tv and video game tv  in the ball pit and barely play with the eqpt we overpaid for.  …. Not allowed to go down the slide with the toddler. Means  we now have to keep redirecting away from the slide and this one loves slides. The “little” slides are great for 6-9 month olds, but not 2 year olds.  the spinning car thing has broken pedals  it was not a horrible time, but it def could be better\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kim Hoang\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing for toddlers. It is very clean and very toddler friendly. They have put a lot of thought into protecting all of the potential hazards for a small kid who is just learning how to walk. My toddler really enjoyed it, and the staff was always cleaning. We would highly recommend this place for anyone who has more children, they have a larger area for bigger kids as well. The place is also very aesthetically beautiful. It’s a little hard to find at first since it is behind the home store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: PRONTO AND CARPET LLC\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Hi, thank you for the review!

With a 4 year old, for a few dollars more than Playland, she had a fantastic time. Absolutely loved all the play equipment. It felt pretty clean, was very spacious, had more things that parents could sit on closer to the kids if they needed help, and truly it was worth the extra dollar or two above Playland to not have to drive all the way down there.\nHowever, the one negative thing I would say is that there's absolutely no security measures for the children or parents. There's no name tags to double check and make sure you're bringing your child out with you or someone else's kid. I felt very concerned the entire time that I had to keep a lookout near the door and make sure no creeps had come in.\nWould really appreciate it if you guys have a name system and check on the tags before the parents and children leave. Playland does that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Demetcha Gochette\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hi Demetcha! Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

My son recently had a birthday party there last weekend and we had overall a good experience but I do wish our party host told us to leave in a kinder manner. Our party was over at 12 and we were out of the play area by 12:15. The party room was completely empty by 12 pm. We were on the side where the chairs were by 12:15 gathering last minute things but by 12:20 our party host came to me and told us we had to leave now and was very rude about it. I understand that we were still in the building 20 mins after party time but we were not in the party room or play area whatsoever.. just on the side gathering things and putting kids shoes on. I would understand more if the facility was busier or if we were in anyone’s way but like I mentioned, our party room was empty and the next party hadn’t arrived yet. At 12:20 the building alone wasn’t even as busy as it was 30 mins prior. I’m really big on customer service and I wish our birthday party experience didn't end that way. I also wish they wouldn’t tell us to start packing up 15 mins before our party time ends which cuts us short of our 2hours that we have booked. I wish they had longer slots in between parties to avoid people from feeling rushed to leave.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: uday kumar komaravelli\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Thompson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vidya komaravelli\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shab Yay\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Nice play area but some of the management staff were very rude!! especially to their own employees yelled at a employee right in front of the paid party u was apart of when it was obviously a training issue, I wouldn't recommend booking their over priced party rooms to anyone you won't even get what is listed on the included  oh yea and did I say rude management\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Benjamin Patton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Neibecker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: this was so much fun for my 4 year old! she was able to run in and independently play for 2 whole hours. she made new friends! it was super clean, and there wasn’t anything too scary or complicated that she would have needed my help with. everything was accessible for her (compared to Playland where she needs a lot of support to get where she wants to go). she had an absolute blast and I got a much needed little break!!! we went on a Friday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. it was hard to find but we eventually got there… it’s behind “At Home”!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandy Stroud\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brand new indoor playhouse!

I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present .

It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility.

We had the room upstairs. It worked out perfectly.  The staff was helpful and courteous.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquia James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had a chance to take my 2.5 yr old to Playland while visiting family in Charlotte. She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Perham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trey Gouch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Frye\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Since outside snacks and food aren’t allowed, I wish the owners would offer healthier options.

It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.

It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location.

(Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids!

We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks.

It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean.

My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly.

I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast.

This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

My toddler loved it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devon Pegg\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Amazing!! I love coming here with my daughter\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sherita thompson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: We booked a party which the details online included set up and clean up . Neither of which were done except sweeping by the staff after the fact . My dad didn’t get to enjoy the party due to watching our food platters and dessert tables from a known ant issue . I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive. My children and I visit here frequently and I typically speak highly of this place but we won’t be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa Aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This place was perfect for my little. It was clean, staff was nice and they made a really good caramel macchiato. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Essence Champion\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility. I really appreciate the staff always cleaning while we are there. The cleanliness doesn't go unappreciated on our little family's behalf. We love it here! Very friendly, professional, and laid-back environment. Of course we will continue to be returning Playland family 💕 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baylee Gibbs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place and just what our town needed! I brought my daughter on her birthday last year and I brought her again today for her birthday this year. Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it’s just perfect. I need to come here more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M Marion\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Clean. Nice area for kids.

So if you can’t bring food in have better options. Everytime we go there there’s only one thing food wise available for the kids the full menu is never available, according to the people working.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J Miller\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M.

Everything was perfect. As soon as I walked in, I could smell the cleanliness. It felt good just to know that they take care to make sure everything is clean. The kids had an awesome time. We had the room upstairs. It worked out perfectly.  The staff was helpful and courteous.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquia James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had a chance to take my 2.5 yr old to Playland while visiting family in Charlotte. She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Perham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trey Gouch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Frye\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Since outside snacks and food aren’t allowed, I wish the owners would offer healthier options. The little muffins are HORRIBLE for you, as well as some other snacks here for purchase. Please offer options with no preservatives and chemicals. Other than this, the place is totally fine!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Serge Filipskiy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zadie Templeton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: First time there this morning and my daughter loved it and so do we\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Infante\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.  The cafe has delicious drinks and snacks as well.  Definitely a 10/10.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brooklynn Dease\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Love the coffee, the playground and the staff!

I would not recommend for older than 4+ as it would bore them fairly quickly (IMO). Snacks, hot dogs & quesadillas, plus all kinds of beverages. Very friendly staff! They need to purchase newer cars for the kids that have more sensory things on them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nijel DeVore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Good Fun For Kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandi Sparks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatriz Requejo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best coffee in town!

It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank u for the best afternoon.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

There is so much for them to do from slides to ball pit, kitchen play, magnablocks, ball pit, ride on toys. I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space! My 3yo, 6yo, and even 9yo very much enjoyed their time. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. The food options are fresh and plentiful. Children are kind to each other. Lovely first experience, would definitely go back:)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was the perfect place to enjoy a couple of hours of active play with my two toddler granddaughters! (Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff.

It is a nice, clean  and affordable facility for a good play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keller Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids were disappointed because it rained and swimming was off the table.

Our toddler enjoyed it. Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing. So just be aware there’s lots of germs floating around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joannn caplinger\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Place smelt like sour feet and toys were laying on floor tripping hazard they let big kids run amongst small ones the changing table was very dangerous and not permanent and secure.

My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted.

My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid. Even the very small kids.\n\nThere are plenty of tables to sit.\n\nThey have coffee and snacks like waffles, hot dogs and potato chips.\n\nParking is easy, they have plenty of space outside.\n\nPerfect activity for when is too hot outside.\n\nIf it is not too busy you don’t need a reservation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nikki Sims\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super cute!

Lots of levels to climb, slides and a large ball pit. There is a kids cafe for quieter play and space for birthday parties. Huge waffles, hot dogs, quesadillas, snacks, smoothies and coffee. During the time we were here, I saw staff continuingly cleaning all the play spaces, including getting into the large enclosure. Definitely would recommend and will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Caspento\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 and 2 year old love this indoor play place! Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Cape\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cool place to explore with your little ones! Coffee was top notch as well\n\nWe will be back soon for another adventure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean. The kids had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: anna tilley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for little ones! My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The price was reasonable and the amount of time allowed is just enough to tire the kiddos out! Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Cora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had such an amazing time at playland today. The coffee is also amazing.

The staff was friendly and warming, the play area and mats were clean and the coffee was bomb!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

I love coming here with my daughter\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sherita thompson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: We booked a party which the details online included set up and clean up . Neither of which were done except sweeping by the staff after the fact . My dad didn’t get to enjoy the party due to watching our food platters and dessert tables from a known ant issue . I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive. My children and I visit here frequently and I typically speak highly of this place but we won’t be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa Aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This place was perfect for my little. It was clean, staff was nice and they made a really good caramel macchiato. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Essence Champion\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility. I really appreciate the staff always cleaning while we are there. The cleanliness doesn't go unappreciated on our little family's behalf. We love it here! Very friendly, professional, and laid-back environment. Of course we will continue to be returning Playland family 💕 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baylee Gibbs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place and just what our town needed! I brought my daughter on her birthday last year and I brought her again today for her birthday this year. Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it’s just perfect. I need to come here more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M Marion\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Clean. Nice area for kids.

She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland!

It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.

It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

Delicious Coffee at the Cafe too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leah H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This is the perfect place for your little ones. There is so much for them to do from slides to ball pit, kitchen play, magnablocks, ball pit, ride on toys. I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space! My 3yo, 6yo, and even 9yo very much enjoyed their time. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. The food options are fresh and plentiful. Children are kind to each other. Lovely first experience, would definitely go back:)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was the perfect place to enjoy a couple of hours of active play with my two toddler granddaughters! (Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff. Love that your own socks can be worn and adults can be on all the equipment to help their Littles. It is a nice, clean  and affordable facility for a good play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keller Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids were disappointed because it rained and swimming was off the table.

Our toddler enjoyed it. Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing. So just be aware there’s lots of germs floating around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joannn caplinger\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Place smelt like sour feet and toys were laying on floor tripping hazard they let big kids run amongst small ones the changing table was very dangerous and not permanent and secure.

My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted. We purchased tickets and filled out the waiver online so we had no wait checking in. The cafe was convenient to the play area and had a lot of items for adults and kids; staff were attentive; and the bathrooms were tidy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaclyn Votipka\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The facility was clean and so unique.

Wonderful environment; we will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlyn Hart\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Playland was amazing!

Always so clean, perfect for your little ones for indoor play. So much to do to keep them busy. Also the coffee bar and snacks are perfect! Would love to see a monthly membership pass in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: courtney ohlsen\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who’s new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid. Even the very small kids.\n\nThere are plenty of tables to sit.\n\nThey have coffee and snacks like waffles, hot dogs and potato chips.\n\nParking is easy, they have plenty of space outside.\n\nPerfect activity for when is too hot outside.\n\nIf it is not too busy you don’t need a reservation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nikki Sims\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super cute!

Lots of levels to climb, slides and a large ball pit. There is a kids cafe for quieter play and space for birthday parties. Huge waffles, hot dogs, quesadillas, snacks, smoothies and coffee. During the time we were here, I saw staff continuingly cleaning all the play spaces, including getting into the large enclosure. Definitely would recommend and will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Caspento\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 and 2 year old love this indoor play place! Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Cape\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cool place to explore with your little ones! Coffee was top notch as well\n\nWe will be back soon for another adventure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean. The kids had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: anna tilley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for little ones! My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The price was reasonable and the amount of time allowed is just enough to tire the kiddos out! Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Cora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had such an amazing time at playland today. The coffee is also amazing.

The staff was friendly and warming, the play area and mats were clean and the coffee was bomb!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present .

It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility.

Other than this, the place is totally fine!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Serge Filipskiy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zadie Templeton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: First time there this morning and my daughter loved it and so do we\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Infante\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.  The cafe has delicious drinks and snacks as well.  Definitely a 10/10.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brooklynn Dease\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Love the coffee, the playground and the staff!

I would not recommend for older than 4+ as it would bore them fairly quickly (IMO). Snacks, hot dogs & quesadillas, plus all kinds of beverages. Very friendly staff!

It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatriz Requejo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best coffee in town!

It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank u for the best afternoon.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

There is so much for them to do from slides to ball pit, kitchen play, magnablocks, ball pit, ride on toys. I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space! My 3yo, 6yo, and even 9yo very much enjoyed their time. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. The food options are fresh and plentiful. Children are kind to each other. Lovely first experience, would definitely go back:)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was the perfect place to enjoy a couple of hours of active play with my two toddler granddaughters! (Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff.

It is a nice, clean  and affordable facility for a good play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keller Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids were disappointed because it rained and swimming was off the table.

Our toddler enjoyed it. Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing. So just be aware there’s lots of germs floating around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joannn caplinger\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Place smelt like sour feet and toys were laying on floor tripping hazard they let big kids run amongst small ones the changing table was very dangerous and not permanent and secure.

My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted.

Would love to see a monthly membership pass in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: courtney ohlsen\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who’s new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid.

During the time we were here, I saw staff continuingly cleaning all the play spaces, including getting into the large enclosure. Definitely would recommend and will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Caspento\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 and 2 year old love this indoor play place! Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Cape\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cool place to explore with your little ones! Coffee was top notch as well\n\nWe will be back soon for another adventure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean.

My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly.

I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

It has so much in this space without it feeling overwhelming or overstimulating. This is likely most enjoyable for kids under 4, and we loooove the special events! It’s a great place to go to beat the heat in the summer and get out of the cold in the winter.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Haley Hildabrand\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We went to Kids Corner for a birthday party and I was so impressed by how clean and organized it was!

We moved to Murfreesboro in November and have no friends or family here, so when I was looking up things for me and my daughter to do I was super excited to see an indoor play place. Kids Corner is an absolutely adorable, clean, and creative play place for kiddos. There are so many different things for them to do and play with. They have free coffee, which is always a plus! Highly recommend!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellen Schumann\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: The kids really enjoyed their time there.  Facilities are on the cooler side.  Long hair in the ball pit bothered me a bit,  but there was an employee going around three times in the two hours we were there, cleaning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamie Fontenot\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We love Kids Corner!

This space is so inviting, the staff is incredibly supportive and the community of parents here is awesome. Great selection of toys - my 2.5 year old was moving and grooving all over. Love how the space is not over stimulating (loud music, loud colors) - instead it’s calming and welcoming.\n\n10/10\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alena Holdman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: LOVE Kids corner and have been taking my 2 year old son here since he was 6 months old. The cleanest play place we’ve visited around the area and it never disappoints. Also have booked an ultimate birthday party for my son and it was the absolute best. From the planning, decorations, cleanliness, and different options available for all of our needs. We will forever be loyal to KC\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We’ve been going since they opened, my little was only 1 year old - now at 3 he still LOVES going!!

They have something for all kids 6 and under, and they keep the activity centers fresh and inviting to play. They have wonderful add-on events throughout the year such as a Polar Express themed Christmas pajama party that we love to experience. Overall, they keep my daughter interested in age-appropriate play, and I love the environment that the wonderful workers have set up there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Wagner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Kids Corner is the best and cutest indoor play center in Murfreesboro. Montessori touches, craft tables, and imaginative play stations all centered around a padded climbing area. The attention to detail is unmatched!! Plus, it’s SO so clean (which is a huge thing for me and my family)!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris Henk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: A great place for our toddler to play!

My two year old daughter always has a blast and doesn’t want to leave. The space is always incredibly clean and they rotate the toys around so it stays interesting for the kids. The staff is so friendly and helpful. There are so many activities from art, to sensory bins, Montessori toys, the climbing area with ball pit, ride on toys, legos, costumes, a play kitchen, etc… there is something for all kids. We’ve never been to an event here but they hold lots of fun sounding events and we can’t wait to try one. Their birthday party decor looks incredible as well. I find the pricing to be reasonable as well. Give them a try!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Michaelaa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My son is 3 1/2 and he loves this place, he is on the spectrum and has not ever been very social until we started exposing him to the wonderful atmosphere of kids corner, he used to get upset by other kids being around him but after seeing how kids are in that environment my son started to come out of his shell and interact with the other kids more, and he absolutely loved the bluey events we’ve been to. All of the staff is very attentive and friendly, only thing I think would be an improvement is a toddler step up potty seat in one of the bathrooms, but I did end up purchasing a travel potty seat to take there and to other places which ended up being an extremely handy purchase. But all in all we love kids corner, I love the Montessori theme, it’s very calm, until it’s packed in there then it’s less calm lol\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Guy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I have enjoyed going to this indoor play place with my daughter.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Phandanouvong\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Beautiful space for littles!

It’s always clean and the staff is always friendly\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Conrad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 6 months ago\nReview: We’ve been to Kids Corner a handful of times now & always have the best time! It’s one of our favorite ways to spend time outside of the house. It is clean, organized, adorable, and so fun with friendly & kind staff!\n\nIt is a smaller play space with good visibility around the room so you don’t have to sweat if your little one takes off to find a new toy. They have an art area, 2 bathrooms, a nursing room, and lots of tables/chairs/several high chairs around the room.\n\nMy 18 month old loves their play kitchen, trampoline, and ball pit. We’ve met up with older cousins and friends and they also enjoy everything the space has to offer! The Thursday music classes are so fun too!\n\nI’m so thankful to have Kids Corner in our community & for all the memories and joy they bring us!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Barbuto\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Love Kids Corner!

The facility is clean and well organized. The staff is constantly putting toys back to where they belong. The place is big enough to keep my kids engaged and busy but sized enough to where I can still keep an eye on both of them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chuck Guinn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids are always first priority. Very clean atmosphere, friendly staff. My grandkids never want to leave!!! Highly recommend!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lis Heij\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids Corner of Murfreesboro is the perfect spot for your little ones to explore and have fun. The facility and its toys are consistently clean, and the staff are incredibly friendly. Kerri, in particular, is exceptional—she always makes me feel so welcome and her kindness really makes each visit something to look forward to!\n\nKids Corner offers a weekly infant hour for ages 0-18 months, which has been a fantastic opportunity for both my baby and me to connect with other moms and their children.\n\nWhether it’s too hot for a walk or rainy all day, Kids Corner is our go-to spot. If it isn't clear by now, I can't recommend this spot enough :-)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Newcomb\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I have a 3yr old and 1yr old and struggle to take them to the other indoor play places without my husband because I can’t keep track of both kids. This place is easy to manage, because the walls are low and I can see the whole space. It’s always super clean and the staff is always really friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: William Ordonez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: 🩷🩷🩷 thank you for your review.

The setup itself is nice, however, I noticed two young children with (Hand, Foot, Mouth) which prompted us to leave due to us potentially putting her at risk. I wish staff and others were more considerate of situations that could potentially put our children at harm. I am hoping that the equipment gets sanitized daily to prevent illnesses.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beth Warrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had the best experience here today, even better than the first time I took my toddler in! I definitely recommend going in if you have little babies or toddlers!

We ran into this miracle corner.\nThe place and the staff have been such a blessing to us. They welcomes you with a smile and talked to you like you belong there. The place does not only have variety of things for kids, but also different programs to choose from. It is clean, calm and affordable for kids up to 6yr Olds. We are thankful to have found you.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Marley Latham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I love this place! It's enriching without being overstimulating.

Best for kids 1-6yo. I could see older kids getting bored easily, but if you have older siblings in the 7-10yo range, they could have fun too. Usually, it's not too busy from what I've seen and relatively quiet, so it's a nice place for parents to hang out as well. It's not as big as some other play gyms that we've been to so you might think your kids won't play as long, but we've found that we have to drag our kids (5 & 2yo) out after 90mins.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lily Termer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son had a blast there! We went for an hour and the facility was clean, inviting, and so much fun!

It was so nice to have the whole place to let the kids play and just relax. The facility is extremely clean (the staff can be seen cleaning multiple times a day), the environment is calm and welcoming (not chaotic like other kids play places), and they also have a private nursing room. They even add a bounce house for the kids! The staff was extremely helpful and willing to make any vision come true. We will be using them for years to come for our parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joy G\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Pike\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charles Ericson (Opie)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tara Allen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We’ve visited many times and every time we stay for hours and my 4yr old still doesn’t want to leave !

Great place for 6 and under !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erica G\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Over priced, staff I'd super rude! If your child is over 1 yr it is just a waste.

Definitely NOT worth the price!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: janita hendricks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I’ve brought my daughter here a handful of times so far, and we’ll definitely continue our visits. Everyone is always so friendly and welcoming. The play stations are so cute, organized, and most importantly - CLEAN. I never get an icky feeling. My daughter always has a blast, so it only made sense to have her 2nd birthday party here. We purchased the Ultimate Party package and it was well worth the investment. The process was fairly simple. I spoke with Alex about our vision for the party, sent my Pinterest board and the rest was history. Communication is prompt and efficient and expectations are clearly stated. Which I love! I become very detail oriented with things like this and I really appreciate thoroughness. On the flip side It felt so weird not doing anything bc with her 1st birthday, we did it alllll. DIY stuff, set up, break down, renting a venue, food, hiring a vendor for balloons, etc. It was just a lot! So going from being really hands on, to just showing up, taking pictures and having fun…. it was different and a much needed change of pace. And we definitely saved more money! Everything was absolutely beautiful and my girl and out fam/friends had so much fun. There was something for all the kiddos to enjoy. Brittney was our party host and she was just so warm and attentive! She really took great care of us. This is such a long review, but this place is truly 10/10 across the board. Cayla and Alex are so talented and I so appreciate the way they handle business!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Ortiz-Ramirez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is the BEST place for birthday parties. They take such good care of you and your guests. Plus, they are experts in decorations. From the very start of our booking to the party, they will handle everything and walk with you each step of the way. When I wasn’t sure what decorations I’d like, the owner created an entire vision board for me. She executed everything perfectly and brought that vision to life. I 100% recommend this place for parties and regular play. The littles will love it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tamia J\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Threw my son’s 3rd birthday party here and it was amazing!

Communication was easy leading up to the party, and the decor was BEAUTIFUL!! I was so pleased, and beyond everything else, my son had a blast at his party!! We have also been here for free play in the past, and it’s a great place to let your toddler have free choice and enjoy play time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla Renfroe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: E we just got done having my daughters 1st birthday here and let me tell you this place is AMAZING!! The owner, the staff, the toys and play areas, the cupcakes, the DECORATIONS 😍!! Everything was beautiful and there was no detail that got missed. Throughout the party I would randomly find special touches that they added in just to make it that much more special. Seriously can’t say enough. Do the ultimate party!! Totally worth it. We showed up 15 minutes before the party and everything was ready. Best experience a mama could have asked for!! Thank you to Kayla, Kacey and the ready of the team that helped!!💕\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patty Puga\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a great space for little kids!!!

Both of my kids a crawler/new Walker and a preschool age have a great time. There are smart spaces set up for a wide variety of ages. We did the basic party package and it was wonderful. We didn’t feel like we were being bossed around. It felt like having a party at your very clean home with a great host. I believe Cayla is the one who helped us set up our own decorations, served pizza and cupcake and juice and made sure even us parents and adults had food, helped solve a balloon issue, helped us tear down and pack everything away, shuttled presents into a little cubby and helped pick up paper. So so helpful and kind. (I ended up re-reading their party policies the week before and noticed they don’t allow balloon garlands brought in which I was planning to do so I’m really glad I saw that and that there is a party schedule on there. I would have been pretty disappointed had I not reacquainted myself with those via their website so be sure to check those out). Overall I would def recommend! The parents/grandparents loved it. The floors are super clean for crawlers. NOBODY got sick which I know is weird to include but for a kids place I just assume we will be sick with something. So they are clearly cleaning very well. This was the easiest birthday party I’ve ever done for my kid and that’s saying a whole lot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: My 13 month old LOVED his time playing here!

Indoor play has been taken to a new level at KC, entertaining little ones of all ages, and providing parents with a peaceful atmosphere for their kids to play and learn. The perfectly curated play stations give kids so many options without overwhelming them with all of the toys at once. No more overstimulation! Children are encouraged to use their imagination…and they do!! We recently booked the Ultimate Package birthday party for our 4 year old and could not have been more pleased. KC made our vision come to life and set up the most magical day for our daughter and her friends. Kids of all ages, newborn to 6, played and laughed and enjoyed all that KC has to offer. Everything we needed was provided. We just showed up, a dream come true! It was the most perfect day at this incredible place. Don’t hesitate to take your kids for an afternoon of fun or book your next party with these amazing people!! 5 out of 5 stars!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justin Boyd\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is pretty neat, but they are not very customer oriented - granted my sample size is now two visits. Today I drove my son 40 minutes for an hour of play with his grandparents only to be greeted by the staff closing the doors for the day because \"they hadn't seen any business for a little while.\" I explained we were there to play and had driven 40 minutes only for the staff member to ignore me and continue closing the doors. Pretty wild to be honest.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: Staff great, birthday party was great, everything was great!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Theresa Prince\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great place for toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Yoder\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had the best time here! Such a fun place for kiddos.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Myers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My two year and and I visited Kid’s Corner yesterday for open play, and I could not have enjoyed the experience any more than I did! I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Such an awesome, unique place for my little one to get to play with other little ones. From getting to dress up and play pretend in a coffee shop, to dressing up in a police outfit and riding a car around playing pretend, to playing in the ball pit with new friends, or playing with cars with new friends, I recommend this place to any parent of littles! PLUS, there’s the perk of them being able to go to a place, and not having to worry about the deep cleaning of a playroom at home! Their atmosphere is so amazing and the staff is so friendly. Plus, all the stations were SO clean! We will definitely be back every opportunity we are able to be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: nickole beaman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Really sweet place and the everyone was very kind.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Bailey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Such an amazing facility.

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting.

They also host fun events there throughout the week! The drinks that you can buy there are delicious, and now I find myself stopping by there instead of Starbucks.

She absolutely loved it! It’s perfect for kids! They can run and slide and play and be loud if they want too! That’s what being a kid is all about!! The owner was super friendly,  we had the best time, and she didn’t want to leave! We are having her actual birthday party here at the end of the month and we cannot wait! 🩷\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karigan Spurlock\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: The place was amazing and set up very well and my son really enjoyed his self and I know kids it just kids but the owners kids one of them kept yelling at my son and the other one kept trying to pick him up and pull on him and she than proceeded to try to force my son to go down the slide pulling him onto and I kept having to tell her to stop and not to pull or hold on him. But other than than the place was really nice just not sure if it’s the place for me if something like that happens every time\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krystina Arey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Absolutely love this place. It has everything you need for a fun time with the kiddos indoors. Give it a try, you won’t regret it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Iron&Cloth Productions\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Took my son there today to check it out and was not disappointed! The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Solberg\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old! My husband and I love it because we can sit and watch her without running all over the place. We also don’t have to worry about any injuries because everything is soft and padded. Definitely has become a regular spot for us :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Harris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Okay, I showed up skeptical not knowing what to expect and left with a monthly pass! My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

We love the play pit and what they have to offer the kiddos in our community. The only reason I didn’t give five stars was because I wish the hours were later in the evenings. My husband and I work opposite shifts and we would utilize the membership more if we had later hours. Not many kids are there to socialize with during school hours and shift changing at 5:30pm doesn’t allow much play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joseph Levine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kalee Morgan\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Loved it, my son loved it, was a nice clean Environment & the staff were amazing too!

The Play Pit was a pleasant surprise and my 4 year old loved it. We bought a one month membership and went a few times each week. It's very clean compared to some other play cafes we've visited. I saw the employees vacuuming, taking the trash out, and checking the bathrooms regularly. All of the employees were very kind and friendly. Even the other parents were wonderful and handled little kid disagreements/rowdiness very well.\n\nOn top of that, it was a great place to get some work done while my little one played. Comfy seats, fast internet, and we were able to bring in our lunch. So grateful to have had this experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jimmy guthrie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Baldazo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: A great play space for the kids!

OK we knew the price. So not a isdue. It was clean & kids had a blast.  Then we are walking out door & a worker stops my 5yr granddaughter & has scissors. My grand daughter asks \" plz Don't cut it. \" the wrkr proceeds to cut string to balloons claiming the weight ( $3 at store) doesn't come with it. WHAT?  We paid over $400 for 90min & u want to make a kid sad cause u can't spare a $3 weight? Yea that ruined our whole experience.  So mayb if u see a kid walking with 4'5 balloons please let the weight go.

There was no party immediately following us, and they showed up handed us a thank you note at 2:50 and started cleaning out from under us. Didn’t say a word and had the whole area cleaned up by 3:05. Meanwhile we were scrambling to get our son’s birthday presents put away so they didn’t get swept off the table into a trash can.\n\nI was under the impression that we would be find to hang out afterwards since there wasn’t a party after us, but instead it felt like we got swept out the door at 2:55.\n\nI’m sure it’s great for just showing up to play, but I wouldn’t recommend the over priced birthday fee. They’ll rush you out the door before your end time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Hart\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The area is large and seemed clean- a lot of seating\nBut parents do NOT supervise their older children.

My poor kids tried to go down and got hit with a giant ball once and kicked in the back of the head the entire ride down the second time they tried to go down. Older kids running and jumping into the small kids area. Ended up leaving worried my kids were going to get badly hurt by the older children.\nThey were just running around doing whatever they wanted and their parents didn’t say a word.\nOh and one kid was throwing a giant ball as hard as he could and hit me (holding a newborn baby) and also hit another parent and their child.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquita\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Great play place!!

Today I had to complain twice to an employee about a group of bigger kids harassing my son. They punched him in the stomach a couple times and I mentioned it and asked how I should handle it - to which she said she had already had to talk to the father once. Then it happened again my son ran up to me holding his head and nose because they hit him again. I talked to the father after that time and he talked to the boy. Then I heard my son yelling so went to see and they had chased him again and he said they spit at him and were chasing him. We decided to leave after that because he was too worried to even play and I was on edge. I don’t feel it was fair that we left because my son was uncomfortable when there was no repercussion for the older kids. I was told the cut off age is 12 but that seems much too old considering the majority is 3-6 it seems and some of these kids were twice his size. I hate to leave a negative review because we do love coming here but I feel that something else should have been done.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K R\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The Play Pit is Norman's only indoor playground and does it so well! 🤗\n\nBeing in a kid-centered environment can be a bit uncomfortable and overwhelming after a while. Still, the Play Pit's cozy antique rocking chairs and furniture, complemented by the modern-chic aesthetic, make you feel like you brought your kids over to your cute friend's house to play. It's as cozy and comfortable for adults as it is entertaining for their kids. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\nThe historic architecture enchants your visual sense, and it is such a great example of adaptive reuse with what would feel like a contradiction in housing a playground, but it fits oh-so-well. We are used to traveling an hour to Edmond for a similar center, and although Edmond's is larger, the aesthetic at the Play Pit appeals to the adults more and makes it a comfy place to hang out and not feel like you are surrounded by raging children. 😌\n\nThe staff is friendly, and it always smells fresh in there. On more than one occasion, I have witnessed them actively cleaning surfaces and the air with Lysol and other anti-bac/viral products.\n\nFinally, with the price of $13 for the first kid and $10 for additional kids and re-entry allowed, it makes for a fun family experience you can feel good about! 🙌🥳 They also offer monthly passes, birthday parties, and private parties.\n\nLast, but not least they offer an assortment of snacks and coffee for sale, in addition to bringing your own food if you keep it out of the playground areas. 🛝\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tahrima Binte Rouf\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Navil Cervantes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place to take the kids to let out their energy!

Great little spot to burn some energy or host a party\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gregory Failing\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A bit expensive for what is offered and no supervision of other people's children.

I booked my twin girls 3rd birthday party and it was a hit! Everyone really enjoyed themselves, the staff was extremely nice and professional and all the kids had fun. The atmosphere was extremely comfortable and everything was very clean despite it being a busy Saturday. It was a lot of people’s first time there but all my friends with kids want to book their next parties there and I would definitely use them again next year. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Studio Honey B Designs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place. An actual gift from above. I don't know what we'd do without it honestly. It's nice all year around but especially during summer and winter months. I can't thank it enough for giving me a space to let my kid run free AND allow me to work at the same time. Truly amazing! The staff is great too and I love that they do parent nights out occasionally! 6 stars!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brayden Gulliver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great for little kids!

Ordering the party online was a big plus. Our party had close to 20 kids and there was another party going on, but still everything went smoothly. They give you an hour and a half, but since we were the last party of the day we could stay longer. The kids had fun playing and then had two tables for the birthday party, which were mostly arranged by an employee. We also liked that the place was big, but not huge, so parents can talk while looking occasionally where their kids were playing.}",

The toys are a bunch of “every day” imaginative toys and activities, nothing special.\nStaff was weird, told my 6 year old who was nicely playing with a toy with his 2 year old sister that he’s too big for it, then the same lady came running over a few minutes later telling me that my daughters diaper was sticking out of her shorts and acted like it needed to be fixed, (she was wearing shorts that were loose at her leg and her diaper sticks out some times), very weird place. Do not recommend. Waste of $23. Better off going to Piney Town in Fuquay or Over The Moon in Cary, relatively the same price with much better toys and staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karl Dwyer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Lovely place very clean, nice snacks as well.}",

I've gone a few times with my kids, and each visit has been amazing. They have an absolute blast and could play for hours on end!\n\nThe atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and we absolutely love the owners. They're incredibly attentive to both my needs and my kids' while we’re there. It’s clear they genuinely care about the community.\n\nWhat stands out most is their commitment to cleanliness and safety—Shay (the owner) is constantly cleaning toys and surfaces while the kids play. It gives me such peace of mind.\n\nI truly can't believe how LUCKY I am to have this gem just five minutes from my house. It’s such a blessing—for me and for all the moms in Mount Holly!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Britnee Reid\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: What an engaging, fun indoor play space for kids! We loved our first visit here and will be back many more times. Thanks for providing such a clean, interactive play option for our littles. Highly recommend to anyone looking for multiple sensory experiences for children to explore to come check out the excitement that awaits here!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marissa Woods\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Cute place for the kiddos to play. They have lots of different activities for the kids to enjoy. A nice sitting area for parents to watch the kids. They also offer free coffee which is nice for those who need a lift. They do ask for you to wear grippy socks so the kids don’t slip on anything. They are also continuously cleaning during play time to help keep the space tidy and germ free. The staff were kind and welcoming. We will love to visit again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sheree Mangum\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My now two year old loved her first visit!

She was able to have a blast with her buddies in a private intimate space! It was perfect! Bubble dance party time is always a hit! Kyle and Shay were awesome host and did great with set up and breaking things down! This is such a clean, cozy and fun atmosphere for your kids!

The owners were genuinely excited to host us, and their enthusiasm made us feel truly welcomed. The entire space was clean, well-kept, and perfect for a kid’s party.\n\nWhat really made the day extra special was the surprise appearance from Spider-Man! He didn’t just show up—he played with the kids and made our son feel like a superhero himself. It was such a thoughtful and fun touch, and our son hasn’t stopped talking about it since.\n\nHighly recommend this place for any kid’s party. Great people, great environment, and memories that will last!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Victoria Brooks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We had an amazing time at We Kan Go Play! There’s so much for kids to enjoy, from sensory activities and imaginative play to ball pits and slides. The owners are absolutely wonderful, so friendly and welcoming. I also love the smaller size of the facility, which makes it easy to keep an eye on your little ones while relaxing in the comfortable seating area or even getting some work done.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart is its commitment to inclusivity. As a mom of a special needs child, I deeply appreciate the thoughtful design that makes it accessible and enjoyable for all abilities. We’ll definitely be back and highly recommend We Kan Go Play for a fun-filled family outing! 10/10! 🤩\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Diane Steil\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Such a wonderful place! The owners have created such a special and NEEDED spot for kids in the area.\n\nYou’re greeted as soon as you walk in with smiles, warmth, and *the most* aesthetically pleasing kids’ space I’ve been to around here. The colors, designated areas - everything was planned so intentionally.\n\nThere’s so much to do, and yet it’s done in a way that invites kids vs overwhelms them. Sensory areas, imaginative play, trains, a scarf wind tunnel, stem activities, indoor playground set, a gated baby play area, climbing and jumping… it’s all there, plus things like board games, color wonder and puzzles in the café seating area - which can also entertain older siblings.\n\nYou can make a cup of (complimentary) coffee, grab a seat, and see your child from any vantage point. Snacks are allowed to be brought in and also available for purchase - plus a water station.\n\nWhile you’re there, you’ll find “Ms. Shay” sanitizing often - checking in, engaging with the kids, and making it feel more like a community than just an indoor park.\n\nWe love visiting here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We LOVE this place! The baby area is perfect for my twins who aren’t walking yet.\n\nMy 3 year old absolutely loves everything, especially the ball pit and the slide! He kept running up to me saying “This is so much fun mama!”\n\nThe owners are also so welcoming and nice. They even offer to help me if I need when I’m there with all three kids by myself. Especially when mama needs a potty break 😂\n\nHighly recommend and we can’t wait for our next visit!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Lane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Such a great find! I’m so excited that Mount Holly and the surrounding local areas finally have a play place for kids. I was always traveling into Charlotte to find activities. We were in desperate need of a place like We Kan Go Play. They have something for all ages 0-5. The ball pit and climbing wall was a total hit. There’s also a cute little coffee truck at the facility so you can sip while the kiddos play; such a perfect combination. The couple that runs the facility was so kind and generous. We will definitely be regulars here. 5+ stars for sure.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marissa Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wasn't sure i was in the right place at first but boy was it a nice surprise!

The play areas are set up so we'll and even had some sensory areas that my little guy loved! The owners cleaned up and sterilized as the little ones played, making sure to keep them safe and allow some wonderful exploration for both the little ones and toddlers/preschoolers.

There were soft climbing structures, a ball pit, and a sensory area with colorful toys that kept the kids entertained. I loved that everything was so safe and age-appropriate—no sharp edges or hard surfaces, just lots of soft, padded fun!\n\nThe party package included a private party room with a serving table, lovely decorations (we also were able to bring some of our own), table seating for little ones, and a cozy seating area for parents to relax in while keeping an eye on the kids. We all had a blast and can’t wait to come back and visit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madeline Hannah\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This deserves five hundred stars.

It’s a little loud, but I mean…it’s kids playing.\n\nYou’re allowed to bring in small snacks and drinks, and they offer complimentary tea and coffee with the option of small snacks to purchase. Being gluten free, this is a huge deal for us!\n\nThe owners are so kind and are CONSTANTLY cleaning and sanitizing. I’m so happy that we stubbed upon this gem!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miriam Perez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We had a great time! My two year old really enjoyed it.

Owners are a wonderful couple that put their heart into the space and it shows.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Dionne\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I would give 10 stars if Google allowed it! I cannot say enough about how magnificent our experience throwing our son's second birthday was at We Kan Go Play. Shay and Kyle went above and beyond in every single aspect and wouldn't let me lift a finger. They took care of everything from helping set up, to loading gifts into the car. My son's party was absolutely perfect. If you are looking for a place to throw a party for your little one please consider them. From the play area to Bluey coming out and dancing with the kids it was impeccable. Thank you Kyle and Shay!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sydney Boatman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Had a great time today. Family run by a husband and wife, and you can tell they put their heart and soul into the business. For the amount of toddlers present, it was amazingly clean. I’m super hesitant about public restrooms, and I let my 2 year old use their restroom, which is really saying a lot from me.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leah Mull\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Visited this gem for the first time today and it was wonderful! The very clear thought and care put into every aspect of this indoor play place is unmatched. There were many different types of play available for children including unique puzzles, a ball pit, slide, and lots of imaginary play areas.\n\nAs a mother of two children at very different stages of development I love knowing that they will both enjoy themselves here.\n\nWe will definitely be visiting  again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mallory Tsiolkas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Our son had the most amazing 3rd birthday party here and we have nothing but great words to speak about the owners. Everything was so organized, fun, and the kids loved every minute of it! We will definitely be back for Open Play soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan O'Brien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 months ago\nReview: Couldn't recommend them enough! I've taken my two girls (4 and 9) for a regular play date and we loved it enough to immediately book a birthday party for the 4 year old.\nWhat you get with a place like this, as opposed to a chain, is that the owners clearly take pride in their work and are very hands on with everything. Everything is extremely clean and well taken care of, the toys are high quality, engaging and actually fun! The area is thoughtfully laid out to where you will constantly find new things as you walk around, but doesn't feel overwhelming with clutter.\nWith the party, I came in to decorate with a random box of decorations and Shay (one of the owners) came out to immediately help bring in stuff from my car and helped put up the decorations with me. Honestly, couldn't have done it without her. They make the whole process as easy as possible, they are there to help when needed and you don't have to worry any clean up!\nOverall, for parties or just a playdate for the kids, this place is a high quality establishment with extraordinary owners!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Lee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We had SO much fun!! This was our first time to go and I took 2 of my kiddos (2 and 3.5) and they had a blast. There was a huge selection of activities for the kids and very clean. I also love that they open EARLY compared to so many other kid activities. 10/10 recommend and we will be back this summer :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meghan Vesely\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We loved this place!! Very clean, owners super friendly, complimentary coffee/tea/water for parents, large snack/seating area and so many different things to do in the large play space. Perfect for a rainy day with toddlers. We'll be back :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: N. Mian\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Great indoor play for toddler and infants.  Small but lots of things to keep kids entertained.  Clean and sanitary.  Owners are so kind and welcoming.  Always enjoy coming here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amie Miller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: A perfect place for my girls (2yrs and 5yrs)\nVery well put together by an awesome power couple.

With A coffee bar for adults, snacks and a nice bathroom. We love We Kan Go Play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Turgeon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: The owners are wonderful. The place has so much to do for both young and older toddlers. We were there for almost 2 hours, and my 20 month old and 4 year old still didn't finish playing with everything.  Will definitely return!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaiti Courts\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: WKGP is always a favorite!! The atmosphere is so fun, and the toys and play areas continue to get better and better. My son loved the new ice cream truck! This spot stays at the top of our list for play places.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine Pickford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: As someone who has been to A LOT of indoor play spaces- I would rate this as one of the best. There is plenty of space for the littles to move around and play safely, but it is small enough that you can sit and watch them play and be able to see them easily. The owners were so friendly and the atmosphere has tons to do without being overstimulating. My 2.5 and 15 month old loved and we will 100% be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda O'Brien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We celebrated my kiddo’s birthday here, and We Kan Go Play made everything perfect! From reserving the party and confirming details to party cleanup, they go above and beyond to ensure the parents can enjoy the celebration as much as the kids! We had a wonderful time and are looking forward to coming back for open play. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dianna Aboulhosn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We had such a great first experience at We Kan Play this morning. We loved that they were open early for our kids, 4 and 2 to play before their nap and they had a blast! The facility had so many different activities and stations set up for independent and creative play. There was a dress up station, salon, grocery store, ball pit, camp site, blocks etc. They have snacks for purchase and great seating for parents. We are so excited to have a play area like this so close to home and look forward to visiting again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: antomeia chaney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: My kids really enjoyed their time there, the owners were very welcoming and friendly it was also a clean environment. A great alternative to take the kids from being outside in heat. We will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsay Mincey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Such an amazing indoor playground with amazing owners! If you have a kiddo with sensory sensitivities or occupational therapy needs this playground will help meet several of those needs! The owners were constantly cleaning the entire time we were there (even the balls/floor in the ball pit!) which was greatly appreciated and they were both so incredibly kind as well - learning each kiddos name. We can’t wait to come back and host parties here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maya Domoto\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We love going to We Kan Go Play. They have so many different kinds of fun toys from sensory activities, activities to promote fine motor and gross motor skills, pretend play, a nice ball pit, and a big structure with a slide. It’s very clean too! The owners are extremely friendly and welcoming. It’s nice to have a place for toddlers in Mount Holly close to our home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Q\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wow, what a great place! I could see the whole play area from where the sitting area is, and everything was set up perfectly so I felt totally safe just letting my kids run around without having me right by their side. The owners are AMAZING and we’re constantly cleaning and even playing with the kids! They even had free coffee and tea for the adults.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justin Spivey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We just celebrated my son’s 1st birthday here and had a great overall experience.

I feel like it’s the perfect size unlike the bigger play places because sometimes those can be very overwhelming as a mom of 2. The owners are super sweet and constantly cleaning which I love that! So much to play with for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D Torrence\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: So much fun and soothing for moms and kids - it’s built for the low stimulation. Plenty of space but intimate. Engaging and warm owners! Went twice so far, once with my boys and again with friends - They have a 10-day play pass to help you and your family $ave! Take your littles and be blessed!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stacy McGuffee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We just had my son’s 4th birthday party here and I cannot recommend them enough!!! Everything about the party was a breeze! Shay and Kyle helped to set everything up, serve the food, cut the cake, and even helped with all of the clean up and loading our car with everything from the party!! I am so happy to have them as a new play place for my littles and as a Mom, I love having them in our community! We will definitely be back and look forward to many visits in the future!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexandra Alzate\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Perfect set up to avoid the heat or cold. Large enough for child to explore with just the right amount of space to oversee their playtime and keep an eye on them. It’s clean and the ownership takes the time to speak to you and ask your thoughts. Innovative toys, sensory sections, and they also can do birthday parties. Section for parents to monitor is comfortable, and gate entrance once you walk in to ensure your child does not make their way out the door without you. Huge fan and will be adding this place to our list for rainy or really hot days.  Suggest you pre book your play time slot as they do monitor their capacity.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We Kan Go Play is awesome! Inclusive, thoughtful design and a lot of love clearly went into this place. It’s comfortable and relaxing, I had a great chat with the owner today about inclusion of autistic children & she seemed so genuinely curious on how to better include and accommodate kids like mine while keeping everyone safe and content. We will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We LOVED this play place!

It’s small space but very clean and age appropriate for babies and even for pre-k and elementary school aged children.

Definately will be going back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Halley Cable\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Owners are gems of people and their space is amazing.

Place was absolute chaos. No one checked us and we went right in. No one in charge to see people through the gate. There was about ten adults with sneakers on and no one made them take them off or or put covers over them. Walking around in my socks while they were they with their dirty sneakers. Doesn't make sense. There was no order and kids arriving for the party had no clue they had to check in. Run by little teenagers with walkie talkies who have no idea how to run a small place. Will not go again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patricia copeland\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandon Armes\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jayceon Evans\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Bad\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgin DiAntonio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rich Gordon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Fun place for kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah and Joe Guilfoy\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sean Coohill\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jade Le Gall\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Amazing experience with my 19 month old,\nEverything was really clean the workers are all very nice.

My son ran around for 2 hours playing fireman, sliding the slides, and playing in the ball pit.

I love that they have a separate section for toddlers in the front, it was a good way for my 11 month old to acclimate himself. They also had little play pretend areas like a fire truck, a doctors office, a grocery store. Really cool additions!\n\nEverything was great and the kids had tons of fun, except for the fact that it was *extremely HOT* in there! it was like walking into a sauna. we were sweating the whole time, even just sitting and watching the kids play. going outside wouldn't cool us down much either. there just didn't seem to be much air flow going on.\n\nnot sure if that's the norm (I'd think not, especially bc it makes me think of the perfect breeding ground for bacteria etc) but that was the only unpleasant thing, so 4 stars! I'm sure we will visit again as my child gets older and more independently mobile.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jacki B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oleyah Njie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Clean and great for toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Paul Green\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dustin Bushika\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Excellent physical engagement for our son, not-too-large for the age group.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: robert horton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruhsan O.\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Well maintained and lots of fun for the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heeren Pandya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very good place for toddlers\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Big, clean, and friendly staff\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liyana Miranda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Went here with my 1 year old daughter and my mother.

They have a large “self-serve” cafè with vending machines & tables with seating. No outside food allowed. Overall the place is a lot bigger than I expected & it was clean. There’s a small play area for children 3 & under. We brought my nephew (19 mo.) on a Monday & it wasn’t very busy so he was able to explore the bigger climbing structures & slides. He loved the ball pit with the interactive games. There are arcade games & some of them are play till you win. Spent $10 on a game card & walked out with a bunch of rubber ducks & a colorful ball. We stayed for about an hour & a half — it was money will spent. We all had fun!}",

Great news spot in time for some fun for kiddos. We will be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DJ Drop Dead\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My son had an amazing time here! He loved everything about his time he spent with the employees and what he had access to play with while there. Can not recommend them enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Fertig\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Such a fun and safe spot to drop your kids off to grab a pedicure, get groceries, or go to a Dr appt. My boys especially love to stay and play, so I stay with them while they play in the various stations throughout the facility, and I sip on a specialty coffee they offer while they play. Would recommend to any parent in the Stanly County area!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Black\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place has good potential. But there isn’t anywhere for parents to sit while their children play. Also, the foam floor squares are coming apart causing a tripping hazard for small kids. I will try this place again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Huneycutt Mills\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I took my kids 1 & 3 here for stay n play and they loved it! There are so many activities and toys to choose from. The space is clean and spacious! This is a great asset to our area so please give them a try! We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aisha Jeane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place was amazing! My two kids enjoyed every minute of being there and were sad to leave because of how much fun they had. I enjoyed my time there as well (inner kid came out haha), very welcoming ladies that work here. Hoping to visit  many more times!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Dick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2 year old had a wonderful time! Place was inviting and clean.

I love coming here with my daughter\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sherita thompson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: We booked a party which the details online included set up and clean up . Neither of which were done except sweeping by the staff after the fact . My dad didn’t get to enjoy the party due to watching our food platters and dessert tables from a known ant issue . I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive. My children and I visit here frequently and I typically speak highly of this place but we won’t be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa Aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This place was perfect for my little. It was clean, staff was nice and they made a really good caramel macchiato. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Essence Champion\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility. I really appreciate the staff always cleaning while we are there. The cleanliness doesn't go unappreciated on our little family's behalf. We love it here! Very friendly, professional, and laid-back environment. Of course we will continue to be returning Playland family 💕 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baylee Gibbs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place and just what our town needed! I brought my daughter on her birthday last year and I brought her again today for her birthday this year. Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it’s just perfect. I need to come here more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M Marion\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Clean. Nice area for kids.

Wish had more tables though especially on busy days. But I know space is limited in there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shannon Green\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Amazing place to spend with your little one's! We had a blast!

So if you can’t bring food in have better options. Everytime we go there there’s only one thing food wise available for the kids the full menu is never available, according to the people working.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J Miller\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M.

The play equipment was appropriate size for the kids but big enough for adults to navigate along with their child. The cafe has a variety of snacks for kids and adults and the drink coolers prices were reasonable.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ramon Castillo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We went this past weekend and we had waffles and coffee.

Everything was perfect. As soon as I walked in, I could smell the cleanliness. It felt good just to know that they take care to make sure everything is clean. The kids had an awesome time. We had the room upstairs. It worked out perfectly.  The staff was helpful and courteous.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquia James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had a chance to take my 2.5 yr old to Playland while visiting family in Charlotte. She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Perham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trey Gouch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Frye\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Since outside snacks and food aren’t allowed, I wish the owners would offer healthier options. The little muffins are HORRIBLE for you, as well as some other snacks here for purchase. Please offer options with no preservatives and chemicals. Other than this, the place is totally fine!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Serge Filipskiy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zadie Templeton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: First time there this morning and my daughter loved it and so do we\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Denise Infante\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.  The cafe has delicious drinks and snacks as well.  Definitely a 10/10.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brooklynn Dease\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Love the coffee, the playground and the staff!

I would not recommend for older than 4+ as it would bore them fairly quickly (IMO). Snacks, hot dogs & quesadillas, plus all kinds of beverages. Very friendly staff! They need to purchase newer cars for the kids that have more sensory things on them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nijel DeVore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Good Fun For Kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandi Sparks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatriz Requejo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best coffee in town!

It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank u for the best afternoon.

Clean and aesthetically appealing for the parents. Minus one star because this play cafe is Expensive. I paid $19 for one child, they surge the pricing on the weekends, after that forget about it if you want a coffee or need to buy your kid a snack.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Paul Gullesserian\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Kept very clean, very friendly staff, and the food is actually pretty darn good!

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

There is so much for them to do from slides to ball pit, kitchen play, magnablocks, ball pit, ride on toys. I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space! My 3yo, 6yo, and even 9yo very much enjoyed their time. Everything is very well-maintained and clean. The food options are fresh and plentiful. Children are kind to each other. Lovely first experience, would definitely go back:)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This was the perfect place to enjoy a couple of hours of active play with my two toddler granddaughters! (Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff.

It is a nice, clean  and affordable facility for a good play time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keller Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids were disappointed because it rained and swimming was off the table.

Our toddler enjoyed it. Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing.

My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted.

Would love to see a monthly membership pass in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: courtney ohlsen\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who’s new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid.

Definitely would recommend and will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Caspento\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 and 2 year old love this indoor play place! Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Cape\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cool place to explore with your little ones! Coffee was top notch as well\n\nWe will be back soon for another adventure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean. The kids had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: anna tilley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for little ones! My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The price was reasonable and the amount of time allowed is just enough to tire the kiddos out! Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Cora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had such an amazing time at playland today. The coffee is also amazing.

The staff was friendly and warming, the play area and mats were clean and the coffee was bomb!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

The variety of Hands-On activities, problem solving creative thinking physical toys,  swings, tents even a zipline. opportunities abound for pretend and make believe;  a playhouse,  a kitchen, manipulatives galore. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. The facility is meticulously maintained and clean. My only frustration is that we don't have one of these in Boone of this size and caliber.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jamie h\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This is a fantastic place for a child to relax and have fun without being overstimulating. The setup is perfect for neuro diverse children.\nMy child is very hesitant to do anything risky. When he comes here is willing to take chances.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alley Williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Absolutely loved it!!! My 7yr old who is autistic had a blast being able to safely play. We brought her 13 yr old and 1 yr old sister. They were all able to play with each other.\nThey all only lasted about 2.5 hours and were exhausted by the time we left. There was so much to do!\nSo thankful we found this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabina\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: My kiddos love this place!

I've actually never seen children this age play this peacefully in a long time. I work in the mental health field and I'm well seasoned to these kind of settings. Without a doubt this place had the best staff possible for these kids. My expectations were beyond met. No, my daughter doesn't have autism but it doesn't matter. She had a blast playing with everyone and she didn't want to leave. Five stars without a doubt and I don't usually leave reviews.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Asia Lowe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: WE HAD A BLAST!

I had my daughters birthday party here this past weekend. We will definitely be returning again! The owners/ employees were very welcoming. They made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The play areas and party room were very clean upon arriving. Our party was private which makes it even better.

As soon as you come through the door, you are greeted with welcomeness! I love they have all the Sensory play so everyone can enjoy it. It's also so clean. My son got to get a sucker out of the Treasure box to help Ease him out the door with a meltdown, and as a mom of a Fiery three-year-old, it was nice not to feel judged. We will keep him coming back.🙌🏻\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hayley Henson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Would give wayyy more stars if possible, the area is so clean, you can tell that they work their butts off keeping this place tidy, toys are in great shape, there is so much to do for kids of all ages regardless.

We really enjoyed the environment and love that all kids are welcome! Will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J V\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is way overpriced given the area. I was introduced to this place through one of my child’s field trip and decided to take my family here only to be closely and physically monitored more than half the time. I do not have any autistic kids by the way. We had a male coworker literally standing close by my kids, even when I was supervising, fixing literally every single thing along as my kids were playing. It was super awkward and uncomfortable to have strangers that close up in you and your child’s personal space making you feel like you’re unwanted company. I could not enjoy my time with my kids when I was being watched within a few yards by total strangers or knowing they’re hawking my kids down. It’s super weird and it’s safe to say we won’t be coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina (Bri)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Was a perfect place for my nephew to run around and play.

We came in around 1:30 and my son loved the play space immediately. We were the only ones there so got to know Heather who was working at the time. She is so sweet to chat with was gentle and patient with my son who eventually was playing with her and not me.. The play space has pretend play areas and more physical elements like rock climbing and a full sized trampoline. There’s something for every child here.  Would highly recommend for anyone with little ones trying to find a way to expend their energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Volentine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The staff at WRTS is incredible. Always inclusive and mindful of all of their regulars. My family has been very satisfied with the level of care and freedom provided to my five year old with autism.

Highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keith Bullard Jr.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: Great play space for kids and reasonably priced. Easy to find, plenty of parking and lots of different activities for different age ranges and sensory types. Staff ratio to number of kids/ parents was good as well. Footprint is much smaller than Defy but adequate. Lots of fun and great alternative for families with smaller children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily McWilliams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had my son’s 3rd birthday here and it was as wonderful.

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff is very nice, layout is wonderful and super clean.

Reservation was super easy online and the staff was so helpful to ensure everything went smoothly. The extra hands with setup/cleanup was a godsend. Everyone had a blast and we are already planning  for another birthday in Sprouts next year!  HUGE SHOUT OUT to Jada and Garryin at Sprouts for making this birthday a fantastic experience for all!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kennie Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Amazing place. Full of sensory items, learning tools and safe equipment to burn energy and keep the mind stimulated. Loved the swinging apparatuses that even helped to calm my 3 and 5 year old admist all of the fun. Highly recommend and hope we get one in DFW!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Glynis Litwin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The playground is fun and the workers look like they enjoy their job. My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

I guarantee they will love it especially now because it’s so hot outside. Sprouts is a great alternative to a traditional playground and they accommodate all ages up to 6 years old. Go check them out they’re great!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Young\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jade M Pettit\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cute and low stress place to bring your kiddos!! They have a ton of different equipment for all ages and it's reasonably priced too! My 4 year old and 10 month old had a blast! Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back. I love that so much was included in the package, and am seriously considering a membership now that I’ve seen for myself how awesome this place is ☺️ if I could give 10 stars I would!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zariya Brevard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time here!

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! Wonderful atmosphere and great sensory toys and activities for kids! The staff had amazing energy and did several organized dances for the kids (baby Shark, Gracie’s Corner) and played lots of great music for them!

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy.

Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog.

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it!

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party.

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group.

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.\nThey have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Lafountain\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: While visiting from out of town we needed a place to play while it rained.

She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles.

Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.\nThe space is clean and it’s got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.\nSo thankful we found this place.\nWe will be back 💙\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie marie\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

Do you have babies and/or toddlers and need somewhere indoors, out of the elements for them to play? And you’d love to sit and drink coffee while they play? This is place for you!

I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it!

There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business.

There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

They have lots to do and lots to explore.  My daughter loves the grocery store building.  There is even a little indoor jungle gym with slide and a climbing wall!  It's a good price if you want to make a day event out of it.  It can get a little busy sometimes so if your kid gets uneasy around crowds it may not be the best place.  We have to leave when it gets busier cause my daughter can't handle it anymore.\nThey have great clean bathrooms with changing tables and extra diapers and wipes if you forgot yours at home!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Lafountain\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: While visiting from out of town we needed a place to play while it rained. Funky Frogs was the place that delivered. Would highly suggest to anyone looking for an indoor play place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley McKinney\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My two boys and I arrived to attended a birthday party this past Saturday and when we arrived the hostess (nana)was a bit rude. She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

Tons of toys and activities provided for my kid to use and develop her growing imagination. Super easy and affordable to maintain a plan. Great opportunity for a parent to work on homework/work in the lounging area as their kid plays and interacts with other kids for hours. 5 star rating hands down. Only if you're able to, before you leave, please help Mrs Sandy pick up some of the scattered toys as you go, a small gesture of kindness travels a million miles. Highly recommend Funky Frogz.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Briana Willett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jevon Brun\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My sons love Funky Frogz!

Checking on all of us all the time even when you think they are not.\nThe space is clean and it’s got so many things. They have a nursing room and diapers in the restrooms/changing rooms. Diapers! In case we forget or something. They also have a change of clothes cause who knows, it can happen. That is so thoughtful.\nSo thankful we found this place.\nWe will be back 💙\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie marie\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I come here often with my kids and we drive a good ways to get there. They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business.

The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos.

We were so impressed and will definitely be back. Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara Karar\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: This place is so filthy.

Not sure what’s happened since then but it definitely hasn’t been cleaned in a while.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Fragomeni\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Not worth it. We’ve come here a few times before but things just seem not to be kept up with. Ball pit interactive game not working (“front desk person said it needs to rest”, ball sucking machine not working, most arcade games out of order. Not worth it anymore and don’t recommend especially as newer places begin to open up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David Grebens\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My wife and I brought our 18month old here on a Saturday and it was a great experience. We decided to bring him again on a Monday the 17th of March. There was blood smearing all over the indoor playground. I advised the worker of this issue. She only cleaned the spots I pointed out at the time. As we continued to play I found numerous obvious spots all over the playground. So, we decided to get off the playground. We proceeded to play downstairs. We where met with a (seemed to be 2yr old, pacifier in mouth) boy. Our son had a baby shopping cart he was pushing around. This other boy grabbed another shopping cart and began to Ram it into my sons. We gently told the boy to be gentle. We removed our son. The boy followed. While our son was playing with something else the unsupervised boy came up to our son and started hitting our son. This is when I intervened and grabbed my boy and left the facility. Don’t recommend on mondays..\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nico Ramirez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Drove over 35 minutes with an extremely excited toddler just to be told place was booked for a private event. Sad the business doesn’t update their website. Very unprofessional.. If you’re looking to go during open play hours I would say call first. Also with Fun Max Adventure park opening up 1 minute away I would consider your options now\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Gregory\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This place use to be very good and an amazing  spot for my son to have fun,  but has become unkept.

Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaslynn Ramos\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: The cutest little place! Perfect for a birthday party or to meet up with other mom friends and let your kids have a blast worry free. They have cameras, so you can still see your kids in the areas that aren't easily to be seen them in directly and a couple of spots to sit down and relax while your kids have fun. My children went to a birthday party just recently (our first time coming here), and they had a blast, and we were able to mingle with the other parents completely worry free. I'd definitely come back again. The only issue is that it's not closer to where I live! Lol\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tatiana Matsuk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My daughters and I had an amazing time today !!

I've had it bookmarked for a while and finally was able to check it out. They also host birthday parties. General admission for kids 2 and older is $16.95, adults are free; if they have a sibling under 2, they are also free. I purchased the general admission ticket ($16.95) plus a pre-loaded $16 game bracelet for $26.95.\n\nShoes are not allowed so socks are recommended. There was a snack area and tables for the parents. Restrooms were clean and had changing tables. The arcade area was small with an air hockey table, photo booth, and various arcade games. My toddler loved the dinosaur egg machine; there were toys inside those golden eggs.\n\nThe playground has two levels and they were soft on the feet. The slides were steep but my son loved it; I can see why there's a disclaimer that it goes fast. There was an indoor go-kart track that my son also loved riding the little go-karts on; it went around the playscape. There were large Legos, blocks, a ball pit, a mini ice cream shop, ride on toy cars, and grocery store. We spent an hour and a half there and my son still didn't want to leave. My other son is a crawler, he still enjoyed the toys at the mini stores and the ride on cars. Overall it was 5 stars for my children and I; we look forward to going back and highly recommend it for kids 10 and under.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Myrna Ramos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Children love it, it is recommended for children of all ages,\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Colleen Curtis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: What a great safe space for kiddos!

It’s the perfect size and lay out so I can always keep an eye on my oldest. The woman who works there during the days that has a daughter is incredibly nice and always friendly when we walk in. She’s always tentatively keeping an eye on things and making sure everything is going smoothly.

Its ridiculous how clean and shiny the place is with all the little kids coming through. We usually do just fine without the arcade add-on and just playing with the playground complex, ball pit, store, vehicles, etc. There are no unnecessary rules and parents can go into the complex to assist kids. Even kids under 2 can have fun here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mira Elezovski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just had my daughter’s 5th Birthday at It’s Playtime and we had a great experience !

Not to mention one of my friends Highly recommend it. I was supper excited to have her party their until the day of her party. We had chosen the Deluxe package were it included everything except the cake. Her party was scheduled for 2:30-4:30pm. So when it was time for everyone to eat due to it was only being a 2hr party. I asked the front desk employee who was ALWAYS on her phone at 3:40 when was the pizza coming? And she looked puzzled and finally said it should be here in 20mins. However, I quickly reminded her that our party was about to end soon, so how is that possible? And she said she had to call her boss to ask her where it was because she’s the one that orders the pizza for the party’s . It was now 4pm and still no pizza. So the front desk employee said her boss wasn’t answering and offered me a $50 gift card to the facility in exchange for the pizza not being ordered and I said no I would like it back on my card if not cash. So she gave me money in cash however, it wasn’t even the full $50 dollars. She either missed counted or didn’t have enough in her drawer to give me the full $50 dollars. So I reached out to her boss that same day and lettting her know what had happen in regards to the money situation and she said she would refund the rest of the money to my card but that never happend. It’s been over a week and I have still never received the difference of what her employee didn’t give me. But not to mention you would think that when someone makes an error of not ordering the main meal for my daughters party which is the  pizza and not fully refunding me for it; as an owner you would apologize but she never did. I mean thank god my family had brought in some small dishes to the party so that way the kids and their family had something to eat rather than nothing. If I had only depended on the pizza being served those kids and their family’s would have starved! Which would of been embarrassing! I am beyondly disappointed in this company, especially when I’ve always heard good things about this facility which is what made me book with them in the first place. Will I ever return their, most likely not. I found it unacceptable for a owner to not order a pizza for an event she was FULLY aware of in advance and knew she was the only one that orders it; along with not being apologetic not only for the pizza but for the refund as well. If you decide to book your kids party here just as soon as you walk in before paying them the remaining balance make sure the employees and management is willing to do their job first! I do NOT recommend this place for party’s. It is just not worth it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Randy Barthel\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time with my two grandkids. Very small, congested space made for a germ sharing environment. My seven year old granddaughter tried the claw machine more than 15 times and did not win once. I do not recommend playing the claw machine as it is a rip off. Won't be returning\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Irujo\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for little ones.  Probably good for children up to 4 or 5.  The women running it are very sweet. My 2 year old grandson loved it.  Be aware your kids (and you if you plan to join them) need socks, I did not see this on their website anywhere.   Be sure the socks are slip proof. They had socks there but they weren't slip proof and my grandson fell many times and I was close a few times.  I'd hate to see someone get hurt that way.  I would have loved to see maybe a few additional pretend areas but it was still very nice.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: איילה חן - סבירסקי\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: nice and calm Suitable for small children and toddlers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kim Prada-Gonzalez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I am driving home blown away on how smoothly my party at its playtime went!

I read the positive reviews and gave it a shot - we all were not from the area and some lived in different states and took the drive.

However they were there this past Sunday and the person working behind the counter had her 3 young children there.

The staff were also very friendly and helpful. The prices were reasonable and we will definitely be going back. I would give It's Playtime 5 out of 5 stars.

I was a bit disappointed this time.\nPros are that the place seems clean. It’s beautifully decorated. There is a lot to do. There is free WiFi and comfortable seating. You can come and go as you please for a low price. The seating area is a comfortable temperature. There is a camera system that allows the grown ups to see the kids playing.\nCons: When we were purchasing tickets we were told that the arcade and ticket pass was a really good deal by the lady at the desk, so we purchased that package. The arcade only has 9 games. The Virtual reality game was not working last year, and still is not. The games are expensive and give barely any tickets. The prizes for the tickets are priced to high. We were told we could save the tickets to use next time but we are from out of town. They would be better off getting rid of the disappointing arcade and adding more seating. Many times families came in and did not have a place to sit. The snack bar in the lobby has a confusing menu and the snacks are not good. I think they would be better off serving coffee for the parents rather than shaved ice for the kids. The website claims it’s for 10 and under but my 8 year old daughter seemed far to big for the place. The giant electronic game board was not working. It was just for show. A machine in the other ball pit was not sucking up and spitting out the balls like it was meant to. The bubble machine in the car wash was replaced by fake fluff. They require socks but did not have any for sale. Many families had to walk over to GAP for socks. Despite the air conditioning and fans, the kids play area was extremely hot. All kids would come out red faced and sweaty. We won’t be going back next summer.\nThis place seems better suited for kids 3-6 years old without the purchase of arcade as long as you bring your own socks and snacks.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Destiny Ferrante\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Absolutely love!!

My daughter's favorite part was the interactive ball pit and the slide while my son's favorite part was driving the cars and shopping carts and the guns upstairs. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.

You get the Scooters/Chuck E Cheese/Fun Zone feel in a clean, modern space. All the people were friendly, staff and patrons, and the modern touch with RFID bracelets instead of tokens was the only thing that made me feel I hadn't slipped into a time warp to 1992.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: We booked a private playtime/party for my daughter to celebrate her birthday.

We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i’m assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it’s too hot outside.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Micah Wolfe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We absolutely love this playground! Our kids loved it even more! (2 1/2 years old and 14 months old) They had a blast and did not want to leave! I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn’t even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend!

She had me sign waivers and then told my son to go play. About an hour into play my sons played hide and seek with another little boy. She seemed to be irritated walking behind them picking up toys. My son was hiding in one of the centers she went in asked my son “what was he doing” he said “I’m hiding” she then tells my son “he needs to get out because she needs to clean up” rude and very inappropriate to speak to someone’s child that way. It’s a play center and if children are not able to have access to certain areas while they clean a specific play area that needs to be addressed with the parents and not the child. And “get out” is never appropriate in a place of business. My son had a very unpleasant experience while simply just trying to play a game. Please watch your children carefully and question them after “Nana” says something to them. She made my child extremely uncomfortable. Over all The center was clean and the boys did enjoy attending the birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniel Riggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Since this place opened in 2022 it has been a staple for my kids.

They love coming to play because it’s a great mix for big and little kids but today was a bit off I’m not sure why but every time I visit it’s always warm inside but today was extremely hot inside the outside temp felt cooler honesty. In addition I’ve been to numerous play places all over I’ve never came across a situation where a parent came in dressed so undesirably and revealing. It’s sad no one asked her to cover up especially after she bent over to assist her child with something and her entire breasts were exposed. She had on a satin tank top very large breasts and her headlights were on the entire time. This is a children’s place and there’s literally Christian music playing in the background. No one wants to see your breasts when they turn around to get their kid or when you’re walking and they’re flapping around like some loose pancakes. It was disgusting and upsetting nothing was mentioned to that parent. This is a children’s place and there was a TON of kids there today. I hope in the future they are more mindful of others attire.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Came here Saturday 7/6/24 and my 1 yr old enjoyed it here.

It’s a lot less stressful than an outdoor playground.\n\nSaturdays can be very busy with birthday parties, and weekdays are cheaper.\n\nI wish there were more gates around doors here though, I’ve seen little kids run and ride toys out the front door and my own kid has tried to snoop around their back room.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darien Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebastian M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners, the play sets, the crowd, the snack options are really nice and all for a reasonable price.\nI will definitley recomend and come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morar Daniela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Lovely, amazing, super clean place with helpful staff and reasonable prices.\nI’ll be looking to get some sort of membership, my 4yo loves it! 🩵🩵🩵 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First impressions are that this place is good fun for the littles. We brought our 11 MO and she had a blast running around exploring all the toys and stuff. As well as seeing and watching other kids doing what they were doing too.\n\nWe might be visiting more often :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicki Kennington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was my first time visiting here. I love the variety of toys and playhouses they have. My 11 mo granddaughter had a great time playing and exploring. I will definitely bring her back.\nMy only criticism is that the music is a bit louder than it needs to be. The volume mixed with kids playing and yelling is a bit much. Also, maybe play children’s songs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jinnow\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Ryan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Delmazeo Sanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ari S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place for my toddler! Hands down the best find we have found for him to come play at. We make a 45 mins drive to come here because of how great it is. Staff is very nice, place is kept clean and organized. Other kids and parents have always been polite too and the play areas have stuff for all different ages to enjoy including for the parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liana Regan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son (3.5) has a blast here!   They have a play structure but a lot of the fun is in their toys and pretend play stuff.  Today they had a fire department, outer space, and camping play areas.  I like that they seem to switch it up to keep things interesting for the kids.  With both lower energy (train table, reading area) and high energy (race track, climbing wall) it offers a nice variety to keep the kids having fun for longer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciara Crane\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We are so grateful for this place! Happened upon it on a rainy day and it's perfect for my 1 year old!  Thanks to the Floridan family for making sanford your home! We will be back!!\n\nWe come here primarily because it is a Christian-based, young child friendly space with relaxed atmosphere. We appreciate this safe-space for our family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Claus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I come here with my kids all the time. It's big and has plenty of stuff for kids to do, and situated between a coffee place and food store - so it's easy to grab a snack or drink!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Cameron (Kim)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My child loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Beam\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Short version - This is an exclusively christian business where anyone not interested in listing to inappropriate, adult christian music is not welcome to play.\n\nWe arrived at Funky Frogs for the first time this morning and my toddlers immediately took off and started to play after seeing the toys. I paid and signed a waiver and only then did I notice that christian music was being played over the loud speaker. I asked the employee, Amanda, if it could be changed to something more appropriate for all families—children’s music, perhaps—and she said that she didn’t have control over the station. After a few minutes I became even more uncomfortable so I simply asked for the volume to be turned down. My children and I were the only people in the store so I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem. Amanda walked towards the back, but did not make any noticeable change to the level of the volume. This was a huge challenge considering I had not only paid, but my kids had already begun playing and I wasn’t willing to cut their experience short.\n\nWe stayed and played and when it was time to leave, I spoke to Amanda to discuss my discomfort and she made it clear that we were not welcome in the space if we weren’t willing to be subjected to inappropriate christian music in what is advertised as a family space. She offered no apology and told me that had she known that I was that uncomfortable, that she would have offered a refund so that we could leave. Only after advocating for the refund myself was I able to get my money back.\n\nThe christian thing to do would have been to  create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, but it is clear that the owners have limited their business to only those who practice christianity. Steer clear if you prefer that your kids not be exposed to religious indoctrination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Love it! If it was a bit more cost effective we would come multiple times a week!! The space snd imaginative play are what my kids thrive on! I cannot wait for a membership option!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Miller\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Best place in Sanford for kids to play!  Extremely clean and great atmosphere!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: The kids absolutely love it here. They are very safe and have a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alyssa Fortner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey Kosem\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 18 month old spent 2.5 hours playing & did not want to leave. Nice relaxing environment. I love that there is a separate little dining area. We brought in fast food & had a quick lunch before playing. It also felt very safe. Owners & other parents were super nice. Staff would tidy up every 30 mins or so.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great for kids! Our 2 year old enjoyed it and our 5 year old made the most of it. The married couple who works there was so nice and I appreciate the nice woman who works there giving my daughter a bandaid when she got a cut on her finger! She made her feel comfortable when she allowed her to pick her own bandaid colored and made sure she was taken care of. We will for sure come again in the near future and thank you for giving us a good time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: naomi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: my daughter absolutely loves this place & asks to go here when it’s time to do kid activities! great addition to town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittany Hendrickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is fantastic!! There isn't a limit on playtime like some places, so you pay and can stay the day. We always go at opening, have lunch there and then leave a bit after, making a decently long day out of it. Everyone is so friendly. My 3 year old always has a great time and is never bored. I hope in the future they have memberships or like 10 visit punch cards so we can come more often. Although you can stay the day, the cost prevents us from going more than 2-3x a month.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Claudia B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 7 year old had a blast. I love that you're allowed to bring your own food. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The ally BEHIND the play houses is so fun. MY daughter loved running through there. MY ONLY negative is I think the place needs more physical things to do. The place is huge with a lot of empty space. VERY high ceilings could provide great opportunity for climbing tunnels up in the air. I think the climbing structure they have is too small and would be easy to get bored on and over crowded on a busy day. Would be nice if it was BIGGER with more tunnels up in the air..something like mcdonalds has. I'm hoping for a GOOD membership bc I have 3 little kids and that would get EXPENSIVE paying each time. Also, I was asked to take my shoes off but all other parents AND staff had their shoes on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luke Wallace\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Incredible family run business. My daughter is 3.5 yrs. old. She had as much fun playing at Funky Frogz today as she had ever had anywhere else! Funky Frogz offers a special atmosphere for toddlers through young children to play together, and to learn through playing. 5 star experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: H and E\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My daughters love Funky Frogz. They can stay there all they and never be bored. Also, The staff is friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tracy Andreotta\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is wonderful for young children to go to play and interact with other young children. Very clean, imaginative play areas and a juggle gym. There is a party room and a place to buy snacks and cold drinks. Small family business owned and operated.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexander Shamburg\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My daughter had a blast here, tons of fun toys and activities for all ages\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Caity Seymore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is wonderful! My children ages 1 and 4 could stay here all day . There is so much to do , it's great for short attention spans . There's a nice reading area , a fun and educational environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kerrianne Dudek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This play place is so adorable I’ll definitely be going back. The price for admission was affordable and the inside is clean and laid out nicely. My 4 year old completely wore himself out dressing up as a firefighter, doing pretend construction projects and racing around the little play stations. The cafe is great, they have so many snack options.  The only downside is my child did not want to leave. It’s been hours and he’s still telling me how upset he is that we left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corey Eye\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It’s great to have a place like this in our town to take the kiddos. Taylor & Nate did a great job bringing this idea together, and our oldest has an absolute blast every time we go.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Nance\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Funky Frogz is awesome!!! Went with our little one today and she had an absolute blast. There are so many different play areas that kids of all ages can enjoy. They brought the fun of Marbles kids museum in Raleigh to Sanford and we loved it. We will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Allison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cate Niezgoda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 3 and 4 year old played primarily independently for two hours with a quick snack break. They have snacks to purchase if you aren't having a \"Pinterest parent\" organized sort of day. I was able to sip on a cold brew while they wore themselves out!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ed Quigley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great indoor play space. Clean, bright, lots of activities.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Vaughan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Funky Frogz is exactly what Sanford needed for kids! A fun, clean indoor play place that kids can engage their imagination! There is even a cafe for drinks, snacks and tables for parents to sit or work while kids play. My girls enjoyed playing pretend at the grocery store and endlessly climbing the play structure. We will be getting a membership once available!}",

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff is very nice, layout is wonderful and super clean.

It was nice to have the pizza and drinks included in the package so there was no worrying about that. I would recommend this to anyone with young kids!

They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Eubanks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great space!

My inner child was pleased 😃\n\nHappy they have play like this for the kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelica Chico\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Our 6-year-old had a wonderful time celebrating their birthday at Sprouts in Winterville! Reservation was super easy online and the staff was so helpful to ensure everything went smoothly. The extra hands with setup/cleanup was a godsend. Everyone had a blast and we are already planning  for another birthday in Sprouts next year!  HUGE SHOUT OUT to Jada and Garryin at Sprouts for making this birthday a fantastic experience for all!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kennie Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Amazing place. Full of sensory items, learning tools and safe equipment to burn energy and keep the mind stimulated. Loved the swinging apparatuses that even helped to calm my 3 and 5 year old admist all of the fun. Highly recommend and hope we get one in DFW!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Glynis Litwin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The playground is fun and the workers look like they enjoy their job. My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

I guarantee they will love it especially now because it’s so hot outside. Sprouts is a great alternative to a traditional playground and they accommodate all ages up to 6 years old. Go check them out they’re great!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Young\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jade M Pettit\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cute and low stress place to bring your kiddos!! They have a ton of different equipment for all ages and it's reasonably priced too! My 4 year old and 10 month old had a blast! Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

Talk about an amazing experience for a 5 year olds birthday party!! Everyone had so much fun, and the employees were SO attentive and even played with the kids throughout. I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back. I love that so much was included in the package, and am seriously considering a membership now that I’ve seen for myself how awesome this place is ☺️ if I could give 10 stars I would!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zariya Brevard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time here!

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts! We purchased a membership since he enjoys it so much!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louis Clark\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: What a cool place for kids to play! My Grandson played on so many different things. Slides, different types of swings, trampolines, and other fun play items. There was plenty of room for him to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine Castelloe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun and safe place to take your kids to play and burn off energy!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brian Fernander Jr\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Awesome for kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shondell Jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is the place to go for all of your kids' birthday parties\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Johnny Vain\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Looks like it's crowded all day, but we go at end of day so our little 'Introvert' can play at her own pace with minimal kids there.  Nice place, hope they get more obstacles\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audra Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a wonderful place!!

Our 18 month old had so much fun and was engaged in play for the entire 75 minutes. Very clean and the front desk staff were amazing. 10/10 experience and will definitely come again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla Garnett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We reached out ahead of time via email to schedule one morning our preschool homeschool co-op could come. They offered for us to play for 75 min then Brianna took us into the studio for a story and music/movement time. We packed our snacks and ate in the studio afterward. All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place. They say ages 1-6 but I personally feel it's more geared to 2-4 year olds. My 5 year old grandson is having a good time but not a lot he can do.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brielle Sanchez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It’s a cute little fun place for younger toddlers!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: madeline Yiznitsky\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience at sprouts today! It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay. I spent $30 to take two of my children, so it would have been nice to stay longer than 75 minutes.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Nichols\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! Wonderful atmosphere and great sensory toys and activities for kids! The staff had amazing energy and did several organized dances for the kids (baby Shark, Gracie’s Corner) and played lots of great music for them! Love how the staff engages with and plays with the kids! And it’s so awesome that they sanitize in between each group so you don’t have to worry about germs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Keilah Howard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I took my 2 year old here and she had an amazing time.

There is so much to do! She was so warn out after she fell asleep on the way home! Owners are lovely, and made the check in process easy!\n\nWe have been two more times and every time willow has a blast! She doesn’t get around kids much so this is awesome for her to get to be around other adults and children ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah S.

She absolutely loved it! It’s perfect for kids! They can run and slide and play and be loud if they want too! That’s what being a kid is all about!! The owner was super friendly,  we had the best time, and she didn’t want to leave! We are having her actual birthday party here at the end of the month and we cannot wait! 🩷\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karigan Spurlock\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: The place was amazing and set up very well and my son really enjoyed his self and I know kids it just kids but the owners kids one of them kept yelling at my son and the other one kept trying to pick him up and pull on him and she than proceeded to try to force my son to go down the slide pulling him onto and I kept having to tell her to stop and not to pull or hold on him. But other than than the place was really nice just not sure if it’s the place for me if something like that happens every time\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krystina Arey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Absolutely love this place.

The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Solberg\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old! My husband and I love it because we can sit and watch her without running all over the place. We also don’t have to worry about any injuries because everything is soft and padded. Definitely has become a regular spot for us :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Harris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Okay, I showed up skeptical not knowing what to expect and left with a monthly pass! My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

The area is exactly what I would want for my children to be able to run freely and enjoy themselves. Owner is very nice and a parent themselves so easy to relay any concerns that might come up. The coffee was fantastic! (I got the S'more latte) will definitely be coming back to get kiddo used to being around other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Solberg\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: You get what you pay for. $11 is not bad for two hours, but there was hair and pieces of trash on the floor and play areas. The no shoes in the play area rule was not enforced for all adults, which is gross for the kids crawling on the floor. The stuff on the coffee bar is within reach of kids in the play area. Each time slot allows up to 20ish kids but it feels cramped with about 7-8 kids and their parents. The owner is very kind, but the entire place feels very DIY. It’s not a bad thing if you know to expect it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jasmine Caldwell Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: We hosted my daughter’s 2nd birthday party at Shelby Play Place, and it was absolutely perfect! The space was the ideal size—not too big or overwhelming, but just right for the kids to explore and play comfortably while parents could easily keep an eye on them. The entire place was spotless, and the pricing was super affordable for everything included.\n\nKayleigh Melton, the owner, was incredible to work with. She maintained excellent communication throughout the planning process and went above and beyond to accommodate all of our needs. She really pays attention to the small details, like providing bathroom amenities specifically for little ones and ensuring the space was safe and secure for all kids.\n\nOne thing that truly stood out was that parents are allowed to get on all the play equipment with the kids. This was a huge relief since we have a little one who is sometimes a bit hesitant. So many other indoor play areas don’t allow this, but here, it made all the difference!\n\nThis play place made for a stress-free, fun, and memorable celebration. I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you, Kayleigh, for helping make my daughter’s special day so wonderful!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Olsen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 15 month old enjoyed The Play Place. It has equipment that is large enough for an adult to be with their child at all times. There is also a section where adults can watch their child and every area can be see.  The faculty contains a table where snacks and drinks can be enjoyed. The entire floor and equipment are padded to help eliminate injuries when kids fall. We will definitely be going back in the near future.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinsey Havener Hinsey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: So much fun for my 2.5 year old!

My kids had an absolute blast!!! The facility is very clean and it’s the perfect environment for my 1-4 year olds! It’s enough space to let them run, jump, play, and explore without feeling overwhelmed trying to keep your head on a swivel! The layout was definitely well designed and well thought out! I’m excited to see the outdoor space once it’s complete and the weather warms up! Kayleigh was such a friendly soul and we look forward to spending many more hours together enjoying play time at the play place ❤️ HIGHLY recommended all the way around!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Murray\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My 3 year old son absolutely had a ball here! It’s a smaller play area perfect for little ones I’d say up to 8 years old! I am so glad there’s an indoor play area in Shelby now! I cannot wait to see this place grow more! We will definitely be coming back!}",

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.  We did not feel comfortable letting our daughter continue to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tasha Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Went on a Friday at 1:30pm and not open.

The gentleman working the desk was super friendly so not sure where the negative comments came from. I was greeted and explained all the rules. Even got a flyer with their party packages.

I took my 1.5 year old today for the first time.

We decided to have our girl's 2nd birthday party here, and the day could not have been more perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful in making sure that we had everything that we needed. They were ready to help as soon as we walked in to set up, they were right there ready to help during the party, and even during the clean up. The schedule of events couldn't have been more perfect. Play time was for a hour and 15 minutes, and the last 45 minutes was dedicated to the party room for pizza and drinks. Sprouts took care of ordering all of the pizzas and even providing drinks!! The kids were allowed to run and play, while the parents were able to talk amongst each other without having to worry too hard about making sure every kid was safe. The layout of the indoor playground is so spacious and open - so it is easy to have eyes on your child at all times. I will always recommend Sprouts to anyone looking to entertain their children in a safe, clean and fun environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Saunders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Garriyn and Talia made my daughter’s birthday so perfect!

We had an amazing experience for my son's 4th birthday. He and his friends had a blast playing on the playground for the first half of the party, then we all moved to the (very spacious!) party room to eat yummy pizza from Michaelangelo's next door. The environment at Sprouts always feels clean and safe, which means the parents could (mostly) relax while the kids went wild.\n\nThe staff at Sprouts were great every step of the way. Briana was so patient and helpful during the planning process, and Talia and Michaela were super sweet and made sure all of our needs were met during the party itself.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Staff is very nice, layout is wonderful and super clean.

The staff is friendly and helpful and the play area and birthday room were incredibly clean. The kids had so much fun and there was something for all - a great variety for our group of ages ranging from baby to 6 years old. It was nice to have the pizza and drinks included in the package so there was no worrying about that. I would recommend this to anyone with young kids! We’re already planning to come back during regular hours and meet up with friends so the kids can play even more!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lee Cuningham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My toddlers had a blast here this past week.

They also had some fine motor activities!  However I hate that they have the TV on and battery operated toys. We can watch tv at home and play with toys at home; I had to peel my kid away from the battery operated toys to get her to run and get her energy out in the bigger space. We tend to stay away from screens and batteries at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Eubanks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Great space!

My child had a blast. Thank you!\nI do think birthday parties should be 2 hours, not an hour and a half. The little ones didn't have enough time for all the typical fun. There wasn't enough time to open the gifts guests brought.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Pierce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We loved our experience here!

Super sweet staff too!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda Branscome\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really wanted to like this place but we paid $15 per child ($30 total )for a 75 min play time. When we arrived the girl told us that because we had the last reserved spot of the day we needed to leave at the 1 hour mark because they needed time to clean and sanitize everything. So we were asked to leave at 5:30 when we paid until 5:45. It says on the door that they close at 6:00 p.m. The employee locked the door right behind us. I asked her why we were not told when we reserved the spot that it would be a different play time and she said she would have to look but never followed up with us and was instead behind the counter on her cell phone the entire time. She started cleaning with strong smelling chemicals before we were even done with our hour of playtime. This is something that I did not appreciate since I am pregnant.\nIf these are the rules, that should have been told to us when we reserved our spot, or our playtime should have been credited back or applied to another playtime. Will not be spending our money here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirstie Steele\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a wonderful experience for my son’s birthday party!

I got so many compliments from party goers, and I really owe it all to the ease of party planning with the team at sprouts!! My kids have not stopped asking to go back.

We love how fun, clean, safe and engaging it is. The staff is amazing, they even played with some of the kids Red light Green light. We will always come to Sprouts!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Trinidad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We started going to Sprouts a little over a month ago and I have nothing but great things to say. The staff is courteous, kind, and often actively engages with the kids during slower times. They sanitize between each session and reset the play area which I appreciate, especially since they serve younger children and it’s flu/cold season! Our little girl is 18 months old but isn’t standing or walking yet and having a safe place we can take her that isn’t overcrowded or overrun by big kids is important to us. I also think that as she grows she will really come to love the big slides and the digital room. In the digital room they have a projector that projects games directly onto the floor. You can switch up the games using the remote on the wall. I must admit my husband and I had fun with that 😂\n\nOverall it’s a clean, bright space with lots of room for open play! Highly recommend and it’s worth the money for what they are offering!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Fine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My grandson loves Sprouts!

All of the ladies working there were incredibly professional and kind! They were wonderful with the children as well. I loved how clean, bright, open, and colorful everything was! We will absolutely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Austins Fun Time\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a neat place.

It was very clean, and my children loved the play equipment! The only reason it lost a star for me was because of price and then being limited on how long you can stay.

I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.\n\nFrancine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!\n\nPlum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!\n\nAs an added bonus, the facility is a Pokémon Gym if anyone plays Pokémon Go ;)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Breanna Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: We absolutely love Plum Krazy. Tons to do for everyone and accommodates all group ages from babies to teens!

Kids said it was hot after running around but mom was comfortable. The swings could use an update/replacement but otherwise everything looked well maintained. Definitely ADA compliant with Service animals and although the business has no control over it, parents were doing well to maintain their kids around the dog. Very impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yesica Robles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Great place for kids !

The play equipment is fun but what makes it really amazing is the awesome folks who work here. Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They’re all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there—Francine—helped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I always expect this to be overcrowded and busy, but it is pleasantly a good mix every time we have come. We DO try to come before closing, help wear these kiddos out for bath & bed 😉 Francine(I hope I spelled that correctly!) was amazing and the latte she made for me was delicious. She also pointed out that the flavor I originally asked for was sugar-free, which was much appreciated! She then followed up after checking on how the latte tasted with asking for a review, which made my marketer heart so sincerely happy to hear! We plan to get a membership for summer, so I’m counting on Francine’s lattes to see me through!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sip & Snack Shoppe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: From one business owner to another, I have to say you all are doing a fantastic job!

Customer service was amazing the staff was great! 😁❤️ The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because, all the snacks were super expensive a bag of potato chips  ( old school .25 bags) was a $1.75 and a juice box was 1.75... nothing looks fresh and everything looked like it had been sitting there for a while because it cost too much.... Other than that!! It was awesome 😎... And I'm definitely going back!! 🎉\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Costner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place!

Such a nice indoor play place for kids of all ages! There is a nice little section for kids under 3, so they are sectioned off and can play freely in their own area while it still being open for parents to see bigger kids play as well! We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it! All of the staff is super friendly and attentive! We always have a great time here! I also had a question for management and they handled in such a friendly way.

Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either… I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Audrey\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was great!

Hurricane Helene hit our area and knocked out half of the power and the AC. The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it’s so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!!

Communication was spectacular even with the hurricane hitting just the day before and dealing with all the residual effects of that. It was really nice to not have to set up or clean up. Definitely worth it! The kids didn’t really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around. I love this place because it’s for such a wide range of ages unlike a lot of other indoor play places that are geared toward only one age group. We highly recommend this place for your party needs!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordyn Fletcher\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love Plum Krazy!

I brought my grandson in today. He was excited about everything. Until he wasn't. Not the fault of the other kid  accidents happen. They have this wrecking ball you can swing on. We were getting ready to go in the ball pit they have. The opening to the ball pit is way to close to where the kids can swing. So my 19 month old grandson got hit in the head, by this kid swinging. Plus the kid didn't even say sorry. Parents r supposed to be watching their kids. Like I said it was an accident. But not teaching the kids to say sorry, and not watching your kid as well. But we won't be back for a while unless theyu have age group for kids set up. The owner gave me an ice pack that wasn't even cold. I shared with her what happen and she just kinda said \"O\". Just thought it could be handled better. But again cool place. Just not for the young ones. If you want to run go to the rec centers or to the parks.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James hurley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great people 👍 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivy Nguyen Trenor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ciarra\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It was just the two of us, Koko and me, me and Koko.

The imaginative play opportunities are endless and there are so many different options for different interests! I also like how some areas encourage independent play for the littles while others are setup for parents to join in on the fun and really play with the kids! The whole space is clean, well kept, and feels open even though each play area feels like it is it's own space. So well managed! My 5 and 3 year old love it here and ask to go to open play weekly, lol!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patrick Richardson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Absolutely fantastic place for parties.

This play place is mostly geared toward the younger set. Probably under age 10 but it depends on how much your kid enjoys imaginary play. My four and six year olds absolutely adore it. The play areas change around periodically but there’s usually a vet center, play kitchen/grocery store, a magic spell booth, puppet show, and a few small games (skee ball, fooseball, basketball) in the back plus a foam pit, small ball pit, trampoline, and a variety of ninja foam blocks to jump and a roller slide and mountain to climb. Also the front area has one of those interactive coloring areas that animates your drawing on a big projector screen. Plus some tables full of building toys. There are plenty of places to sit and chat with other parents while staying within range of your kids. I’m always impressed with how clean they’re able to keep it and how chill the vibe usually is. At our last visit they added a new room full of airtoobz machines which kept my four year old busy for most of the play session. They also added a “snowball fight” area where you could pelt each other with tiny fluffy balls. I ended up in there with both my kids and nephew having the best time. It’s a really great place to go let your kids have a fun without being overstimulated and blasted in the face with screens and lights and ending the day in a meltdown. It gives wholesome playdate vibes and I just adore it. It’s really what the children’s museum in Portsmouth wishes it could be. If you’re a family with a quiet calm child it’s amazing. If you’re a family with a wild animal child climbing the walls and trying to parkour off every surface in your home it’s amazing. Bring em both. They’re gonna love it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jill Queen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: What a great place for kids to stay fully engaged for the two hour open play. They had foosball, skeeball, basketball and ice hockey in the back, great for those a little older. The variety of physical play (foam pit, ninja jumping), imaginary play (pet shop, wizardry, pirates), and interactive floor and wall space was great. We found it very clean too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Price\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We loved our time at the Play Spot! We went during Open Play.

Great play place for all ages, including adults. Great customer service & the kids always have fun (they love the gifts they get when leaving). The Open Play sessions are held at convenient times. The birthday party set up and experience is seamless and we will be having our twins next birthday here & can’t wait for all their friends to try it out. The Ninja Warrior class is for ages 6-10, which our kids can’t attend yet but look forward to signing them up for it. The private rentals are great for daycares, summer camps & school with a reasonable price. The one year anniversary party is coming up next week & my kids are excited to try out the new inflatable balloon bubble house. There is even a black Friday sale of punch cards giving 50% off open play admission, which we will be taking advantage of. Overall, this is a great place to take kids of all ages to have fun & run out some energy. Give it a try, you won’t regret it! :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Cadenhead\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The Play Spot is phenomenal.

The activities are versatile and suit all ages. The adults even have fun.

We had our daughter's birthday party that had a wide range of ages. The Play Spot was able to keep all kids and adults engaged. The policy that has parents stay was strange to begin with, but I think the parents had more fun than the kids. Amber, our host, was so helpful and made all the families feel very welcomed. The birthday set up was great as we were the only ones there. We did not have to worry about other guests infringing on our fun. We highly recommend The Play Spot for parties and for even a play spot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Washington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: What a cute little spot with so much to discover!

Amber was our party host and she did a great job providing our party schedule and straightening up as the kids played. We brought our own food and decorations. Highly recommend for ages 12 and under. Even my teenagers that were there had fun playing. Lots of make believe, games, and things to climb on. This place could accommodate around 15 kids for the party and it was way better than previous parties at large play places because it was more than just a play ground (in my opinion).\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: fallon Harrison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Awesome spot, very clean.

The owner was friendly and sweet to both the children and me. She was very involved with all the kids and so loving. The little sections for play are adorable with a little kitchen, tool zone, animal/vet area, police/fire station. The kids loved the slides but the favorite part for every child was the bubble machine ! Those kids loved it paired with music.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Reske\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Such a fun spot for toddlers!

This location specifically has the much beloved zip line and huge jungle gym.\nOnly downside is in the back of the whole thing there's a section of the jungle gym that opens up and it's just a couple steps to a drop. Safety concern there, but generally kids are smart enough to avoid it or just get bad vibes.\nOh and their arcade is whack, but you really ain't going there to play with the arcade so no deductions there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: If you’re curious about having a birthday party here, here are the things you need to know. It’s lengthy.. sorry 🙃\n\nTime: We had a birthday party for our son and let me tell you the time frame they give you for the room is NOT worth it. They don’t serve the pizza until after 30 minutes so you have 45 minutes to get through the pizza, sing hbday, do the cake, & presents, get every body out of the room and get everything packed up and get out of the room yourself. Play time is until they close so that’s beneficial but you did pay for everyone already so it’s actually expected.\n\nFood: pizza is from papa John’s and is very good!\n\nFees: if you get sick or have an emergency and need to reschedule, they fee you $50. Children get sick all the time so you would think they would be understanding being a kids place but they very much not understanding and do not care at all.\nThere is also a $75 fee if you go over the party room time for every 5 minutes over. We were all stressing trying to get through everything to be able to get out in time especially since they don’t let you in early to decorate or set up the food and cake, ect and don’t serve you immediately either so  you wait 30 minutes before you get the pizzas to eat so you really only have 45 minutes total for everything.\n\nThings included: they say decorations and plates and napkins are included. We received table clothes, a happy birthday sign, and only 10 plates and napkins. The juice boxes are the capri suns and they only give you 10. The reservation is for 10 kids and 15 adults so you’d think they’d give you more options or atleast waters for everyone. Good thing there’s a grocery store near by or the adults will starve and not have anything to drink or eat on because just like us, you will need it to go buy yourself more plates, napkins, cups & drinks.\n\nViruses/sicknesses: be prepared to get sick if coming. We managed to get the flu the week of our son’s birthday and had to reschedule. When we reached out to the owners to let them know we were all sick, the options the owners gave us were…\nOption 1: keep the date because they said “we’re going to lose your $300 this weekend if you don’t show up”  Yet, they knew we were all sick with the flu… and still wanted us to come in so they would “lose” out on our money.. I find it very irresponsible of these owners to sit there and say that to a parent.\nOption 2: pay additional fees ontop of our $300 we spent for 1 hour rental of a room. Which really is 45 minutes when you actually get to start eating.\n\nAs a parent, we obviously rescheduled and ate the cost because we in no way would want to get the other kids sick and we obviously didn’t feel well ourselves but to know the owners are willing to send people there knowingly with the flu not caring that it will get all the other kids sick is disgusting.  We usually come every month with friends and family but I think this will be our last time knowing now what we do. They’re so desperate for an extra $50 they lost a lot more from us in the long term.  We know kids get sick and we try to have fun and be safe but now knowing you’re intentionally letting people come in sick because you allow people to keep their reservations when they tell you they’re sick instead of simply rescheduling them to keep everyone safe without fees attached is bad business and it’s gross.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tina Remington\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Had my grandsons birthday there.

The kids love safari nation, and it's a very safe, clean play experience for them.\nThe birthday packages are very expensive and stressful though.  They don't allow you into your party room until 10 mins before the party, which makes it hard to set up, supervise and greet the guests as they arrive.\nThank goodness our pizza arrived on time (we've been to other parties where the pizza is very late), but it still left us rushing through pizza, birthday song, cake, and presents.  You must vacate the room at the end of your time or you will be charged an extra $75.  It was pretty stressful to get everything out in time and I couldn't help but think it stressed the kids too.\nAlso, they really need things for the adults to do!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zachary Whitaker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Farid HACHANI\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joanna Granado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Hosted my daughter’s birthday here on a weekday.

The date the pass is purchased the pass expires 30 days from that date whether it is used or not. My son’s Grandfather purchased a monthly pass for him and wasn’t told that the monthly pass had an expiration date on it before even being used one time. The pass was purchased on 3/30/24. I wasn’t able to take my son until 4/27/24, so my son lost 27 days from his birthday gift. The worker told me that my son’s pass would expire on 4/29/24 and if I wanted to purchase another month I could do so. So my son receives a monthly pass for a birthday present and he can only use it for 3 days now because we weren’t told it needed to be used immediately!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Reg Rogers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for my eldest daughter to manage.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: TGLKRL\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Not a great place for toddlers because too many bigger kids are running wild and screaming.

The volcano makes so much LOUD, unnecessary noise and it goes off constantly so there is no rest from it while watching your kids play. Also the men’s restroom needed toilet paper while we were there. A friend ended up having to use paper towels to wipe with while there. Not pleasant! Other than these things, the kids had a blast so that’s a plus.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawn Carson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids love going here but this past time the so called adults were acting like children.

Well i guess they will feel better when their child is grown up and they are looking down a barrow of a gun because no one can tell there child anything. Dont get me wrong if it was done in a bad way i would have agreed with him but it wasnt.

We arrived right when they opened and little did we know that the place would soon be taken over by lots of older kids from the Y. All the commotion from all those kids did overwhelm my son at times, but we still managed to have fun. I appreciated how large their 4 and younger section was and there were 2 slide options. I wish there was staff regulating that area a little more as some of the older kids did attempt to play in the area. With the larger playground, there was a good variety of slides and activities. However, there are some areas that need to be fixed as you could see things were falling apart after lots of wear and tear. There is a section where you can shoot soft balls and my son was scared of that noise and it was going off often. I appreciated that you could bring outside food, but not sure why you cannot bring outside drinks. Overall, it can be a hit or miss on how busy it is so you just take that risk when you go. Also it truly depends on your child if they will like that type of environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tracy Freeman\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place was just \"NASTY\"...Trash in the floor,the tables had trash left on them, drink spilled on the tables ...

They usually avoid opening the zip line. When they do, it seems like the employees are arguing over who's turn it is or isn't to operate it. There's one girl (I should have got her name - not the one always in the hat) that always goes above and beyond to be sweet to the kids when she operates the zipline. If the girl in the hat and the man are there, they don't bother opening it. Instead, they pretend to sweep at the start of every hour. If by the off chance they do open it, it's at 15-20 minutes after and keep it open for 10 or 15 minutes only.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha White\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Today was my sons 4th birthday party, and I will never use safari nation again. I called and asked about my reservation and they confirmed that they had the color green wrote down and that I could only have 10 minutes to decorate with my stuff. I also asked when they ordered their pizzas so I could make sure mine was ready at the same time. They told me they would be ready at 2:15, I got there and they literally made me wait till right at 10 minutes to get in the room (I saw other families that got in while the members were cleaning from prior parties) then i get in the room and they didn’t have any of the green things out. So the 10 minutes I did have pushed me further back, and had my guest watch me set everything up. I was given the room with no instructions. They didn’t give me the juice boxes till 20 minutes before my party was over and the pizza got there with 30 minutes left in the room. You only get one hour in the room. I’m thankful I had juice and pizza for the kids or we would have literally been sitting there till half way when the room time  was over. My child’s name wasn’t wrote on the door for my guests to even know where to go. There was signs on the table telling me to tip my party attended but I had no attended the whole time- I was even told that an attendant came with my package- I had no one helping the whole time. When I asked about it, they said I had to request one and that no one would really be in there much anyways. The staff were very rude and acted like we were a bother. When you spend almost 400 dollars, I expect so much more. I have had several parties at other facilities, and will definitely use those. It was embarrassing to me, and even some of the people at the party that are members of safari nation. We will not be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allison Butterfield\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Toni Whittaker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for a birthday!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Nice place.

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.

Look forward to you coming back again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Little\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My son is 3 years old and LOVED this indoor play place. The customer service here was great. We are not locals and I was initially confused about which location I had booked for open play. I text the number on the website to confirm the location and the owner immediately called me to direct me to the correct place. My son played for the entire two hours. The swings, climbing walls, and slides were all accessible and appropriate. Shout out to Hunter for “racing” my kid on the slide and making him feel welcomed in the space. This was such a great find during our winter beach vacation as the weather did not permit many outdoor activities. My son was able to get some energy out and had a great nap after a morning filled with fun.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Comfort\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Yesterday was our first visit and our 4yr old son had an incredible time!! I can't say enough good things about the Star Academy! First of all, it was a rainy day for us in Marion and we needed to find something fun for our very energetic toddler. I looked on their website, which is super easy to use and saw they had an Open Play session available from 12-2pm! You have the flexibility of either paying when you book or when you arrive. I appreciate that option very much because sometimes plans change when you have children. We were greeted by the owners, who are absolutely lovely people and were so welcoming! Star Academy is extremely clean and has a very cozy atmosphere. They have so much to offer little ones! I was very impressed with how they maximized the amount of space they have with features like nooks above and below the play areas. My son loved the slides! They offer 2 slides, one that is free standing,  and one twisty slide which is enclosed. The foam block pit was a huge hit!! My son loved jumping in the blocks and building towers with them as well. The owner's 12yr old son, was there and did a phenomenal job with the little ones. He introduced himself and asked them if they would like to build a fort with the foam blocks. He said, the magic word, \"fort\" and my son was so happy to have someone to play with since he's an only child. It's a wonderful space to play with your kids or step back and let them enjoy playing on their own. When my son woke up this morning, he immediately asked if we could go there to play!! The owners offered to make the adults coffee upon arrival and put some snacks out for the kids to enjoy, which is very thoughtful and kind, although my son was too excited and busy to eat anything! They have books, sensory toys and a closer filled with blocks, play dough and sand. Everything was organized, neat and easily accessible for the little ones to explore and choose something to play with in between sliding, swinging, climbing and jumping! We had an amazing day!! Our son didn't want to leave so we purchased an additional 1 hour session. However, I think we will take advantage of the 3 month deal, unlimited play during open play sessions for $188. It was a wonderful experience and a great family outing. We are now a Star Academy family!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Zac Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Thank you so much for your 5 star review- so happy you joined us today to play at Star Academy and had such a great experience!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Becky Brazis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We spent a rainy morning bringing our 2.5 year old here!

The owner was extremely friendly and supportive during our visit. It is more than your normal \"Drop-in to play\" spot and your kids will not want to leave. We visited on the first full day of vacation and we will go back before we leave.

Pretzels and ice cream are definitely our new thing. Thanks to Mrs.Joanne!! We will definitely be returning to have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel McPherson\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: While it’s a fun place for little kids (I would say like 4 and under), it just wasn’t for us. My son was as bit by a dog when he was a toddler and has a fear of dogs. While we are trying to overcome that fear, it was hard for him to play. The dog is friendly and was happy as can be, it would have been nice to know prior that there will be a dog running around with the kids. Also the place was smaller than expected. Definitely good for toddlers or younger kids. The place is clean and a very cute set up, just wasn’t for us.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jillian Scotto\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had our son's 2nd birthday party at Star Academy and it is the ONLY party I've even thrown where I wasn't an anxious/stressed out mess! Joanne kept reassuring me that everything would be perfect and it was exactly that.  They took care of everything!!! My son had the best birthday ever.  Stephanie was an absolute doll too, she always has her eye one the children and their safety.  We also have done Open Play which is worth every penny, it is a great price to boot!  We look forward to participating in the STEM classes this summer!   The facility is ALWAYS so clean! They truly care about the children and their parents/caretakers. It's a blessing having a place like Star Academy in the area!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Nicole\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son and I love it here! So fun, so much to do, I don’t have to worry about him getting hurt or running off! He’s engaged the whole time and has a blast here.

Joanne is extremely welcoming and her classes and staff are excellent. The gym is laid out and decorated beautifully. Finally, we have a place where kids of all needs and abilities can learn and play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Morgan\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is beyond overpriced. Not to mention the website says it is $22 per child yet we were charged $24. It is a small stripmall office space converted with an indoor play structure. The max age for a child to play should be 4 yrs old. The owner has poor customer service is rude to both the children and parents. Don’t waste your money and spend that same amount going to a bigger facility with more options and a nicer staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kayla Henson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My toddler said, \"Yay! I have so much fun!\" 😆  It's not your typical assembled plastic jungle gym playspace. It's a well-designed space with quality, wooden play equipment and four different types of swings (my girl's favorite). Owner is very nice & keeps the space clean. My little one can get over-stimulated in a new space with other kiddos, but she did really well there, and there's several cozy nooks she could go to get some zen too if needed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah J\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had my sons 2nd birthday here and were completely impressed with the service and care the staff put into making his day so special. The owner reached out to me several times to make sure everything was in order which I greatly appreciated. Day of, the staff made sure everything ran smoothly and were so friendly to our friends and family.\nWe would highly recommend Star Academy for birthday parties!\nSuch a fun place for little ones to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M N\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This company sponsored our son’s soccer team this year and then graciously hosted the kids for their end of the season party. It’s such a fun place for kids to just be kids. The whole team had a blast! We will definitely be back again and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an indoor fun venue.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katherine Alexander\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very cute inside, well kept, and the owner is really great!

The owner is so personable and you can tell she put everything into making this spot amazing for children. We’ve been a few times right when she had it cleaned and she keeps it that way. We have never had any issues whatsoever and I’ll continue to bring both my children. I recommend this place if you just don’t know what to do with your kid one day, if it’s rainy or it it’s too hot out - they will wear themselves out having a blast.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kirstie dalton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely adore this place and the staff really tries so so hard to keep everything organized which is so important when you are responsible for children from all walks- literally the only way to keep everyone safe as well.\n\nJoanna Is so caring. She has literally texted me when I haven’t shown up with the girls just to ask if we’re ok or do I need anything because she knows how extremely busy we are since we own multiple businesses ourselves.\n\nI have high anxiety children and they feel safe, respected, secure and loved in her care. We have used Star Academy for birthday parties as well and she’s learned that even though she will supply everything I still feel the need to bring my own decor and she welcomes it and ask how she can help get it set up. Literally just the best people- they just want to make everyone’s lives easier and we appreciate this space so much!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsay Murphy\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I brought my daughter and her friend here today because my oldest daughter was attending a birthday party across the street. From the minute we walked in it was a completely overwhelming experience. The lady running the center immediately barked at us to take our shoes off, was rude about the fact that we hadn’t paid yet and in between checking us in went on a long diatribe about the center itself. It was honestly too much. Don’t forget adults can have sensory issues and be overwhelmed as well! I don’t have a problem taking off my shoes but when you tell me over and over it’s because you worked so hard to clean the floors all by yourself you made me feel like we were ruining your place. I told you my oldest wasn’t staying and she said she asked you if she could look around for a few minutes. The minute she started playing with something she barked rudely  again telling me we needed to go ahead and pay for our older kids. I already told her they were on there way out the door. I agree with rules and a place with kids needs to run smoothly but it’s all in the delivery and how you talk to people I was nervous wreck the whole time. Her “assistance” with the kids was following them around and telling them what to do. We couldn’t relax we couldn’t just enjoy for fear the kids were going to mess up her clean room! I gave it a two stars because the girls did have fun, it was clean and a good concept. Just tell the lady running it to calm down . She could learn a thing or two from the sweet lady who ran the butter and whisk party. She was polite, good with the kids, and didn’t make the adults feel like we were in the way! One last thing if you are going to fuss at everyone to take their shoes off as soon as they come in maybe don’t have your dog running in and out with dirty paws or your husband come in and not take his shoes off…just saying. My kids and I love dogs but not everyone feels the same. Maybe ask us first if it’s ok to have your dog running around! Respect goes both ways!We will not be back I felt awful the whole time we were there .\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mads & Tre\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our toddler LOVES star academy. We had his first birthday party here & all the kids had a blast. Joanne is AMAZING, she catered to our every need & even decorated so we didn’t have to stress about it. She also took tons of pictures so we could enjoy the time with our son. We’ve been back since and had the same great experience. It’s the best place to go to get out of the heat or if it’s raining outside. 10/10 recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dave K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I've only been here once but it was the best and most magical place for our little one to play.

We were offered coffee as soon as we stepped through the door. Kids had a blast running around and sliding down the slides. The giant foam pit was a great addition. They have a sensory area as well that the kids did crafts in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michaela Giard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Took my 2-year-old here yesterday and it was awesome! The owners are incredibly nice. The playspace was very clean and organized.

Worth every penny. 😊 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Pate\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Amazing space, impeccable customer service, beautiful staff inside & out, super friendly and convenient. We held our three year old’s birthday party here and when they say they do everything they mean it! The least stressful party I’ve ever hosted.

Joanne has become a loyal friend and I trust her with my daughter. If you knew the challenges we have faced, you would understand what an incredible compliment that is. We are treated like family and I love my daughter has a safe haven.

Avery the owner of this fine establishment is very humble and friendly, he noticed my child was pretty parched and offers a water bottle for him. The place is small but not tiny..

It was great that they have a sibling discount, because with multiples, stuff can add up quickly. We walked in to a clean play space that was covered in toys the kids enjoyed playing with by the end of our 2 hour session. When we were leaving, the worker was cleaning and organizing for the next group to come in and do it all over again. They have a really nice coffee machine which I really appreciated, the coffee was delicious! Tables and a couch for parents and 2 highchairs for the babies. The bathroom and exit doors have a sound bell to prevent kids from escaping. The bathroom is stocked with baby wipes, poop bags, hair ties and even tampons. Our play time was full so there were a decent amount of kids and parents in the building but it didn't feel over crowded and didn't prevent the kids from playing with anything they wanted to play with. The blue \"Elsa\" dress was a big hit as well as the fireman hose. The only improvement I could suggest is having one more small couch for parents to sit on and I think it would be perfect! This was a fun place for the kids to let out some energy especially with all the rain we have been having lately.

I say it's perfect for ages 0-5. Lots to play with and climb on, and a fun dress up and pretend play corner. We had the place shut down for our party and it was perfect! Great service too ♡.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Garrett Kohlhof\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amanda was great and helped us set up a private party for my son’s Birthday. Both my sons enjoyed so much that we got the membership and routinely visit, which helps a lot since the summer is in full swing. Little Bee’s indoor playground is clean, comfortable, and easy. Thank you\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We LOVE Little Bees! My littles (1 & 3) love to play here multiple times a week. Very reasonably priced especially for a membership which we definitely get our use out of. Perfect for rainy days or to take a break from the summer heat! The play environment is always clean, well thought out, and inviting. The owners are so kind & plan fun events like story time/crafts and pizza play nights. I love how there are tables to sit and eat a snack or watch children play. Perfect place to meet up for a play date. 10/10 would recommend😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janelle James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My family had the best experience at this indoor play place. The owners were so friendly and down to earth. They are great people and very personable. The environment is targeted to younger kiddos. Our three and six year old kiddos had a blast. They played non stop the full two hour session. We were just stopping in the area for a short while during our travels but if we lived here then we would definitely get a membership here. Thank you so much little bee indoor playground! We had a fantastic time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: H T\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This playroom was perfect for my 2 year old!

It was very sensory friendly and so many different areas/things to play with. The snack bar has a great selection and even a free coffee bar for the parents.\nThe lobby/lounge area is the perfect place for mom friends to meet up! You can tell much thought was put into this process... from the nursing room, to having high chairs for the littles. THANK YOU for bringing something like this to New Bern!🥰\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baily Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A}",

This is by far our favorite establishment to go to. I love how cool they keep the building for the kids and parents. They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nick Lackey\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that’s intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out…. I walked away… about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife’s mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn’t melt. All this to say, if you don’t pay the 200$ for a party, don’t take any food or drinks…and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don’t ask if you can bring anything in… you’ll probably get talked about like your a criminal… total of 150$ spent here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joel Crotts\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ricky Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: They have some games to play and plenty of space for the kiddos to play and run and bounce out their energy! Lots of obstacles and levels to play in, a slide from the top level of the play / climbing area.\nWent today and they have rearranged the kids play area some which opened the play area up some.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dina P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: Updated review - 5/22/25\n\nFirst time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn’t help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn’t put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.\n\nThen wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn’t wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can’t I’m super clean I can’t let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!\n\nThen I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!\n\nWould I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn’t happy\n\nThat broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Juniel\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had a birthday party and was really bad, nothing fun, it is not according to the description of the page, I even feel cheated because it's not even close to expectations. What a disappointment. Bad place to celebrate 😔 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Marte\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The worst of the places to celebrate birthdays, I feel cheated, I paid a lot of money only for 2 pizzas, a couple of juices, a poor table and a decoration of the worst and to they liking, the bracelets are useless you can't play on the machines even paying for a birthday party, they don't have music, they don't make the birthday boy happy, they don't do anything to celebrate a birthday in that place. Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ash Jay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We've been coming to this establishment for years! We love this place. The staff are amazing. The manager here is very professional. She makes sure the children feel safe at all times! If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth James\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lexi Helton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Had my daughter’s 2nd birthday party here.\nRooms were clean and staff were super sweet and accommodating.

I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amanda S\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I brought my daughters here to play, they had a blast. They're too little to notice, but the toddler area, the floor looks very grungy. The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.\nThey had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Botello-Joffe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We had my son's birthday here and the staff made it so easy!

The “toddler area” gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn’t get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you’re going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cinthia Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: tomas aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scott Wilson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Great place to take your young children to play.

We've brought our now 2.5 year old here for the past year whenever we are in  town visiting and he loves it.  The ball pit, maze, giant slides, and trampolines are fantastic, and the downtown Salisbury street with the shops that kiddos can play in is a cute addition.

The cleanliness has become a major issue, with unpleasant odors, visible stains, and deteriorating foam blocks that haven’t been replaced. It’s disappointing to see the lack of upkeep.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Moulton\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel Bishop\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: If they had a zero I’d leave that! this place is falling apart!! the trim and floor! the trim has nails popping out everywhere I guess they are waiting for a child to get seriously hurt and someone sue them to fix it! Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don’t fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don’t even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn’t let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I’m another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don’t tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you’re business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristen Weaver (Kris)\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We had a lot of fun and games for everyone to play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Latoya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back 😊\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Myers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savannah Sabol-Ross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ludek Vasatko\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super 😉 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raven Mcdonald\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: kaitlyn toof\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Kids are obsessed with this place, it’s a great arcade/ jump place, inexpensive & clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bobbie Jo Kelly Greene\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: We had a Birthday party and it was great!!

This was the second time I’ve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It’s not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robyn Lesondak\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Eaton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ivelisse Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Khyati Sheth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2 year old loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Larry Ford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for the kids and parents.

She had the nerve to question my son and his cousins age. As if they were lying about how old they are. She said it very nasty too. Then she decided she would half way help me sign the waiver and half way speak or assist me. Didn’t even tell me I needed to scan the QR code. But began helping a woman behind me fill out the waiver and explained it to her step by step. I said “thank you” to her twice within a few minutes. She didn’t respond to either. I’ve brought my son here a couple times because he loves it here. But I promise miss thing in the front with the enough attitude for everyone in Rowan County….move her elsewhere!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Himes\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had fun with my grandson on a Friday afternoon!

However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Stern\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn’t expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol\nThis was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molly McClure\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Always a wonderful time at the Fun Factory!

I definitely thought it was bigger from the pictures. They offer day passes memberships and birthday packages. Parents were allowed in the equipment which was great for my shy 2 yr old.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelynn Adams\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any “special” event… this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter’s wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to “sit down and have a special snack” that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn’t tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren’t even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Bartlett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don’t know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn’t take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn’t have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn’t have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mitzi Bare\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the \"reserved\" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the \"manager\" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: crystal moton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids love this place and I love taking them here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Moore\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thomas Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: One of my daughter's favorite places to visit, the staff is always nice and the mango bubble tea is delicious.

Get there no one is doing this. Go to buy socks for my 14 month old and they charge me and can see he is little bitty. Shows me the socks and says this is all I have and the size was like a 2 to 4 year old size. Oh we can't give refunds she says. Many repairs need to be done in the building. Lots of trim pieces and floor pieces missing or falling off all over. I would drive to another location over this one next time but was there for a birthday party\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dubon Mejia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: nekeisha prawl\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bradley Rogers\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle richeson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun for all\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Timothy Siegel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews…What you see is what you get in their pictures…Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I’ve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning…\n\nIt’s one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents\n\nPlace is priced perfect… it’s not the biggest but it’s not for older kids…The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It’s injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry…\n\nThe food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven’t seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child…\n\nIt feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more…they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jackie Posnanski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun place for my granddaughters to play! One of the best things is that Adults can play too!!!!!!  Great price, very nice staff, everything is clean and they have Coffee there for me so I can keep up with my granddaughters haha.  I've recommended this place to several people I know with little ones.\nTrampolines, Velcro jump suit, obstacle course, arcade games, tunnel slide, and a ball pit area for the wee ones. this place is FUN!!!}",

It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility. I really appreciate the staff always cleaning while we are there. The cleanliness doesn't go unappreciated on our little family's behalf. We love it here! Very friendly, professional, and laid-back environment. Of course we will continue to be returning Playland family 💕 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baylee Gibbs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place and just what our town needed! I brought my daughter on her birthday last year and I brought her again today for her birthday this year. Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it’s just perfect. I need to come here more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M Marion\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Clean. Nice area for kids.

So if you can’t bring food in have better options.

Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment!

It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!

It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids!

We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days.

It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable!

My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The price was reasonable and the amount of time allowed is just enough to tire the kiddos out! Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Cora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had such an amazing time at playland today. The coffee is also amazing.

The staff was friendly and warming, the play area and mats were clean and the coffee was bomb!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

My toddler loved it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devon Pegg\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Amazing!! I love coming here with my daughter\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sherita thompson\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: We booked a party which the details online included set up and clean up . Neither of which were done except sweeping by the staff after the fact . My dad didn’t get to enjoy the party due to watching our food platters and dessert tables from a known ant issue . I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present . I was unfortunately unable to get my deposit back due to poor communication . I booked this party 4 months ago which was very disappointing and expensive. My children and I visit here frequently and I typically speak highly of this place but we won’t be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vanessa Aguilar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This place was perfect for my little. It was clean, staff was nice and they made a really good caramel macchiato. We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Essence Champion\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility. I really appreciate the staff always cleaning while we are there. The cleanliness doesn't go unappreciated on our little family's behalf. We love it here! Very friendly, professional, and laid-back environment. Of course we will continue to be returning Playland family 💕 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baylee Gibbs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place and just what our town needed! I brought my daughter on her birthday last year and I brought her again today for her birthday this year. Awesome place for adults to relax and get a coffee (which is amazing btw) and let your kids play. They are constantly cleaning so I feel safe letting my daughter play here. One entrance one exit it’s just perfect. I need to come here more often.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M Marion\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Clean. Nice area for kids.

The staff was helpful and courteous.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marquia James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had a chance to take my 2.5 yr old to Playland while visiting family in Charlotte. She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland! Strawberry Matcha was a 10/10!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Perham\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trey Gouch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Frye\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Since outside snacks and food aren’t allowed, I wish the owners would offer healthier options.

It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!  And when my niece and nephew came to visit, this was the perfect spot for outings.  It feels so safe since the space is enclosed and stickers must be turned in before leaving.  The cafe has delicious drinks and snacks as well.  Definitely a 10/10.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brooklynn Dease\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Love the coffee, the playground and the staff!

I would not recommend for older than 4+ as it would bore them fairly quickly (IMO). Snacks, hot dogs & quesadillas, plus all kinds of beverages. Very friendly staff!

It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Beatriz Requejo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Best coffee in town!

It was wonderful for my toddler, and we'll go back with my 6 year old who will also love it. Not a huge place but I liked that to be honest. Great snacks and drinks as well. We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank u for the best afternoon.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

There were a lot of things that were accessible to my lil dude! He’s still crawling but had a lot of options for him to be able to play with compared to some other places. It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

I held a birthday party here so I can't speak to the ticket purchasing process but we will definitely be back with friends.\n\nOnly comment would be based on watching play I think 8 is too old to be at this location. Lots of little ones getting knocked down by the bigger kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hahna Robinowich Hayden\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Lovely little indoor play space!

(Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids! Additional play kitchen area and party space. My 5 and 2 year old LOVED it. Nice little Cafe option area with snacks, drinks and good coffee. Nicely trained staff.

Unfortunately he also developed croup a few days after going.\nI know they have a policy of no sick kids and they will be ‘asked to leave’ but I remember hearing other kids with nasty coughs there playing. So just be aware there’s lots of germs floating around.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: joannn caplinger\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Place smelt like sour feet and toys were laying on floor tripping hazard they let big kids run amongst small ones the changing table was very dangerous and not permanent and secure.  Too tight of spaces no room def the poorest play land we have been to.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea J.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: 10/10 recommend Playland Lake Norman’s MAGICAL play space and cafe! The play area is so fun, clean and leaves nothing to be desired! The cafe is such a sweet treat to add to a good play time! The price point for play and the cafe is exceptional! This is a well oiled machine ran by lovely staff. We cannot wait to come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: masood md\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Great Place for kids and parents, we loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Powell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Really happy with our first visit and we will be back. My five and a half year old had a blast and there is plenty to do for all ages including babies who can sit unassisted. We purchased tickets and filled out the waiver online so we had no wait checking in. The cafe was convenient to the play area and had a lot of items for adults and kids; staff were attentive; and the bathrooms were tidy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaclyn Votipka\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The facility was clean and so unique. We had kids ranging from toddlers up to 8 year olds and the playground was great for all. The coffee was delicious, reasonably priced and the staff were so polite. Wonderful environment; we will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaitlyn Hart\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Playland was amazing! I have been a total of 3 times since they have opened and will continue to go! They are very clean and I don’t feel like I have to worry about the kids getting sick like other play places!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bria Argrett\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love playland! Always so clean, perfect for your little ones for indoor play. So much to do to keep them busy. Also the coffee bar and snacks are perfect! Would love to see a monthly membership pass in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: courtney ohlsen\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who’s new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days. The play area is really fun for our two boys and the workers are constantly cleaning. The have a cafe and my wife and I got a frappe that was better than Starbucks. There’s sweets like cookies and waffles, hot dogs, quesdillas etc. Our kids had a blast and we will definitely be back this summer!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Staff is clear explaining the rules and friendly.\n\nPlace is clean and they have activities for every kid. Even the very small kids.\n\nThere are plenty of tables to sit.\n\nThey have coffee and snacks like waffles, hot dogs and potato chips.\n\nParking is easy, they have plenty of space outside.\n\nPerfect activity for when is too hot outside.\n\nIf it is not too busy you don’t need a reservation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nikki Sims\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super cute! Coffee and Waffles are 🔥🔥🔥🔥 All my kids had fun 6,5, and 1. …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Prichard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Brought my 5 year old here today and she LOVED it. Lots of levels to climb, slides and a large ball pit. There is a kids cafe for quieter play and space for birthday parties. Huge waffles, hot dogs, quesadillas, snacks, smoothies and coffee. During the time we were here, I saw staff continuingly cleaning all the play spaces, including getting into the large enclosure. Definitely would recommend and will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Caspento\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 4 and 2 year old love this indoor play place! Not only is it super cute, but it is very clean, the employees are constantly walking around wiping things down and cleaning up all while being extremely kind and friendly to all of the young kids.  We have been twice and the kids didn't want to leave.\n\nThe coffee is great, and not too expensive, and the kids got one of the birthday cake waffles, which was huge and a perfect special treat for them to share.\n\nThis place caters to younger kids, so it is nice to not have to constantly be worried that my little ones are going to be trampled, we will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Cape\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cool place to explore with your little ones! Coffee was top notch as well\n\nWe will be back soon for another adventure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelyn Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I want to start off by saying this is not a reflection of the facility by any means. It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean. The kids had a blast!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: anna tilley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for little ones! My 1 and 3 year old were able to use the facility with very little to no help. They do allow parents in the play area to help kids if needed. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. The price was reasonable and the amount of time allowed is just enough to tire the kiddos out! Will definitely be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Cora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had such an amazing time at playland today. The coffee is also amazing. We will definitely be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Koehler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My almost 4 year old had so much fun!

The staff was friendly and warming, the play area and mats were clean and the coffee was bomb!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Tucker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: During our visit the workers were so nice and constantly making sure all the equipment was clean for the kiddos. I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

Adults are allowed to go as well and there's so many nooks and crannies to run around. The trampoline has an area for younger kids, and then one for older ones too.

We live close yet we've never been here, but one of my friends who is a regular said it was “better than SkyZone,” so we gave it a try and are now slowly also becoming regulars!\n\nThe kids had a lot of fun with the 2 HR Value pass, and even us adults managed to have fun too, especially with the car racing and arcade games! I also like how the little kids have their own trampoline area, especially with staff keeping it that way, which was not easy on the Saturday with all the rush. The place is also CLEAN! As a clean freak i was impressed with how maintained everything was, especially the washrooms, there was no bad smell which is NOT a usual at like most places.\n\nThe main reason for this review is a staff member, I asked but forgot her name (i just remember its start with K and hijab) but, what happened was that my daughter was getting scared on the wall climbing and kept wanting to come down, yet also wanting to go up as it was like her first time.Now usually most get annoyed and just let the kid leave, but she didnt do that. I guess she noticed that my daughter really wanted to do it(I also was insisting that she do it) except was scared, so instead of like \"getting over with it\" she kept encouraging my daughter by telling her how she was so brave and just being very understanding. As a parent, I appreciated it a lot as she was patient, like not frustrated or in a hurry and just genuinely helped my daughter have fun! I really do recommend this place to other parents!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rey Jeric Belleza\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had a great birthday party for our son today.

The coordinating of the event is great and very helpful for the busy parent. The add one offered are great and really helpful with making the party great\nThings that made the event non pleasant: the place is limited to the time of the party...you cannot stay after the event is over for the kids to play. More to that is that the employees made mistake with bracelets and the timing on them and didn't validate their error. Kept coming to guests and asking them to leave.\nAlso if you would like a review from people please don't shove the Google sign in the face of the party organizers asking for review. I had the sign of Google put in my face three time during the party, with last time being by the front desk employee who clearly expected me to fill the Google review here and now, while my hands are full with party related items to be carried out to the car.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adil Houf\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Hi, thanks for the kind review\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ASH King\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Very organized specious place will definitely visit it again.

They didn't care about the children sliding down and just rushed up from the bottom. They knocked down the children sliding down very hard. I reported this incident to the boss, but he didn't handle it and allowed such dangerous things to happen. The experience was very bad. I won't come again. A playground that doesn't even care about safety incidents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mohamed Abu Hatab\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 months ago\nReview: Spacious and fun, clean and not too crowded as there is plenty of stuff inside for kids to do\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meshari Alenzi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Hi, thanks for the kind review\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bahar At\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Hi, thanks for the kind review\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melek Karaoglan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place for kids we loved it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiffany Chung\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Hi, thanks for the kind review\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: George C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place for kids to play and great service.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aygül Karaoğlan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: A place where children can have fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oishee Ahsan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My daughter has amazing time here.

They have mini golf outside, and a whole indoor playground for the kids. This spot is a great spot to bring the kids and let them run and play and have fun.  They absolutely love it. You can stay here for hours. The concessions are ok and fairly reasonably priced. The equipment is next level and a real gem in the area. If you’re traveling through it’s a nice spot to take a couple of hairs detour through, but mainly I’ve seen that it’s more of a destination spot.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Trey Swinney\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Thank you\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We have a 17 hour drive home from our family vacation.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was better than anything I could have dreamed. For my crew of little humans (4 of them) it was a 2 hour drive. Worth EVERY mile. My kids range from 10 to 2 and my 4 y/o has profound autism, every one of them had a blast!! If your littles have any sensory issues the music might be just a tad loud but once you get into the play area all the foam (padding) muffles it down nicely. This place is truly for everyone, big kids, little kids, awkward in-between kids, special kids, and adults who are kids at heart ❤️. We will definitely be coming back (I wish tomorrow), and would not hesitate to recommend this place to EVERYONE. Best money I've spent this year. Thank you Kidvsille.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicholas Oliver\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the awesome review! We’re so glad you think our place is great!

Hours and hours of fun for super cheap. I have a crawler and a 5 year old. Both have a blast. Love that the baby has her own area to play in but she can also climb most everywhere else in the gym. I was a little disappointed in the cleanliness with our last visit. I know it’s hard to keep a kid area clean! It’s need a really good vacuuming. There was a wall with broken pieces that wasn’t cleaned up either and it was definitely a choking hazard for littles. We still love this place though! We will be back. I hope the cleanliness improves though!\n\nAnd I hope the rules change on outside food. For those who have food allergies, they can’t eat there and you can’t leave the building to eat in your car and come back in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tom McLaughlin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the awesome review!

It's affordable and worth the price. The bathrooms were clean, but need to be marked better.

Our group of kids were so sad when it was time to leave.  We could have played all day, but we will be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I took my 16 month old son here today for some fun. We were excited to see the new facility and was hoping to have a good time. While he was playing and having a good time on the peg wall an older boy decided to shove my baby to the ground because he was taking the pegs off the wall. This was completely unacceptable and the parent didn’t see this happen for some reason. I’m sorry but in a place like this children should not be left unattended because my son could have gotten hurt by this significantly older boy in the toddler area. I was thankfully within arms reach of my son the whole time. I unfortunately won’t be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Cicero\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the awesome review!

There's so many things for the kids to do. It's very clean and the staff is amazing. There's a lot of climbing if you want to experience each section of the playground. Don't forget to wear socks if you plan on playing. There's a nice cafe' section with cameras of the playground if you want to sit and relax while your kids play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rachel DeVito\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for kids to play for hours!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Felicity Thompson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fantastic for all ages!

Reasonably priced for one adult, unsure however why they feel they need to charge when both parents want to hang out and watch. It almost feels like they would prefer less people buy their concessions and to also appear less busy. From a marketing perspective it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I digress...\n\nIt's a good spot, would definitely recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Malaya Davis\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Selena St.Marie Hancock\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Could use a good deep cleaning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: BR Vigilant-Davis\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place!

This place was even fun for me to get in there and chase my son around. It did get extremely warm in there, you could tell the A/C wasn't on and my son was sweaty fir the majority of our time there. So even if it's cold outside dress the kiddies down once they are inside or they will over heat lol. They had a Little soccer/basketball area that was the highlight of the trip there. It seemed pretty clean but I didn't not see staff go around and wipe things down. I would've liked to have seen that. Kids were drooling, sticking their mouths on everything in there haha kids will be kids.

It’s a great indoor option when the weather isn’t very good. It’s very clean. I would love to leave more stars, but during our most recent visit we were told that our “day pass” we purchased was only good if we stayed in the parking lot. We had gone back to our relatives’ house to allow our 2 year old to nap. This policy was not communicated when we made our purchase, and even though we presented our receipt, we had to pay for two day passes for one child. This policy should be changed or it should be clearly communicated to everyone upon purchase.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Allyson Butler Summers\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris Cooper\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Luna\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Willie Boothe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Highly recommend.

Vern goes above and beyond to make sure everything goes smoothly and to ensure we have what we need for each party.

There are a few paid arcades for different ages (including those even a 2-year old can use). These require COINS - so make sure to have toonies and loonies with you. Outside food is allowed so you can comfortably feed your kid with whatever healthy/special diet/kosher food you bring with you. Local cafe is also available.\nA good place to spend a few hours on a rainy day :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mahima Nigam\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: This place could use a lot of improvements in terms of maintenance. There were enough options for children under 2 to play. The older kids also didn't have many options  beyond the main climbing area. The food/snacks options were limited as well for parents and kids. The staff was OK. They didn't have something as basic as bathroom slippers since the place didn't allow shoes(which is great). We had to manage without going to bathroom for 3-4 hours because we are just to comfortable using public washroom in our socks.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ehsan Arabof\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Very clean and organized place for kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Valentina Navarro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ An amazing place for kids & parents!\n\nWe recently celebrated my son's 5th birthday at Funtastic Forest, and it was a fantastic experience!

I came with my 1 y/o and the same group of older kids kept coming in and throwing/jumping/kicking in baby area. I had to bring it to the staff’s attention and they attended to it asap but I wish they were more strict\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Za A\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: I visited there with my child, and unfortunately, it wasn’t a good experience. Some part of the floor is made of hard ceramic tiles, which I found to be slippery. My child slipped and hit his head on the ground, which was extremely concerning.I saw a girl fall off the machines too. The choice of flooring is unsafe, especially for younger kids who are more prone to falls. I’d strongly recommend that the flooring be replaced with a more child-friendly material like rubber or soft matting to prevent injuries.I would never go there again though.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bahar\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We were invited for a birthday party and had a great time.

Took my 2.5 year old son and he enjoyed. Slides, toddler ball pit, bouldering wall, and plenty things to climb around on. I think you can bring your own food too which is a huge help. Small Cafe there if you want to buy coffee or a snack. The price is great, in ottawa it's 22.99 per kid plus 14.99 for a parent. Here it was 15$ after tax for me and my son. Able to crawl around the spaces if you need to supervise your little one. Wear comfy clothes\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: This is an excellent place to host a kid's birthday party! We celebrated my daughter's 3rd bday here but all children aged 2-10 were having a blast! Three floors of climbing structures with slides, tubes and colourful soft mats spanning the width of the play place make it an attractive and fun place for kids to play till they're exhausted, while parents sit and enjoy a coffee or lunch at the little snack bar. For my daughter's bday I was worried about not having time to decorate but the hall had the party room so nicely set up with a big board saying \"happy birthday --\" (with her name on it) and all we ended up having time to bring were helium balloons, and it was perfect! We brought our own cake and everything else was provided in our package. It was awesome being able to go home after without a ton of things to clean, sort and put away. Vern and his awesome staff took care of everything and we were free to enjoy our time with our friends!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Slava Peker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amazing place for birthday parties.

Funtastic forest is a 10/10. Very spacious (no blind spots), very clean, a variety of gross motor activities for children and the staff is very professional and hard working-especially the owner. Funtastic Forest has a variety of packages that make planning easy for families-leaving us with little to do. Each time I’ve had a party here, families have raved about the fun experience they have encounter-leaving them to return again-I have been to other play places to celebrate birthdays and Funtastic forest by far takes the cake!!! I highly recommend this place and will 100 percent be returning for my children’s birthdays. What a great team!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark Svara\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place.  Lots of things to do including a large climbing structure. A ball pit.

The kids absolutely loved it and so did I!  The playground provides endless fun.  Most kids said it was the best play place and party they had been to!  I can't thank Vern and his team enough for the exceptional service they provided.  He went above and beyond to ensure we could provide the best party possible.  He  was amenable and compromising because he understands how important it is for any parent.  Thank you so much, it really was a phenomenal experience.  As most people have commented the facility is very clean and well maintained.  I'm also very appreciative to Vern for being so accommodating with my walker-bound mother, thank you.

My review is based on hosting my son's last two birthday parties here at ages 2 and 3.  Some of the highlights I can share are:\n\n- The staff are friendly, helpful, and professional.  The owner Vern is a great guy.  He was very accommodating and easy to deal with in the planning of our parties.\n- The entire facility is well maintained and is very clean throughout from the playgrounds to the washrooms.\n- The amenities for the kids are so good! My kids and their friends loved the toddler area as well as the big slide! There are multiple playgrounds with a main corridor that is spacious.\n- There's a nice coffee bar for parents/adults, plenty of seating in the front area, and comfortable massage chairs.\n- The party rooms are very nice and have tables, countertops, and seating.\n- Lots of parking out front and easy to find location.\n- Indoor air quality and temperature were perfect.\n- Safety and security measures were nice to see such as the staff controlling who enters and maintaining a list of people in the facility.\n- Pricing is very affordable and fair.\n\nNo negatives at all.  We'll definitely book here again!  Thanks so  much!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: SJA\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: If you're looking for a clean and spacious place to host a kids birthday, FUNtastic Forest is the best in the business by far.\n\nVern is Amazing, always responds to inquiries promptly, space is clean and he and his staff are all so helpful.\n\nThanks Again Vern and team, we'll definitely be back soon!\n\nSonia & John Savo\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: mouslam ali deeb\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kate Baraz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Kids have fun.

The parking lot is clearly under some sort of construction, however the “curb appeal” of this establishment was terrible. The front door is covered with wood..there are cigarette buds all around the front door also. As soon as you walk in it smells like an old smoked in building. We were only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes, there was no air in the building so we were all very hot. The floor and equipment was just absolutely disgusting. It looks like no one has swept or mopped in months.

I notified the front desk staff they stated they’ve had ants for a while and couldn’t do anything with pest control with children / pesticides present .

It’s a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.\n\nThe food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it’s a nice place with a lot of potential, and we’ll likely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lacey Clay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Very clean facility.

So if you can’t bring food in have better options. Everytime we go there there’s only one thing food wise available for the kids the full menu is never available, according to the people working.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J Miller\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M.

She had a great time! I loved the concept of having a cafe for the adults but they also offered food such as cheese quesadillas and waffles for the kiddos! Great place for toddlers and it’s very clean!! They were even cleaning/sanitizing while we were there which was awesome. They played Christian music which added a nice vibe to the environment! I wish we had one in my city, Maryland!

It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.\n\nWhile the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.\n\nI truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you’re visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We love it here!

It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean.

From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids – colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.\n\nWhat really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The café is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you’re planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond – it’s worth the trip! We’ll definitely be back soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A B\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karen Van Vliet\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: As a grandma, I love this place for my grandkids.

It’s was super cleab and the coffee smelled amazing! We’ll definitely be back!\n\nMy only “complaint” was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid’s diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Great place for 2 - 5 year olds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Richards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Super cute!

(Of course it would be great for older kids too.) Because the staff limits the amount of occupants, everyone is able to play safely and freely enjoy all the play areas. The facility is exceptionally clean. I can't wait to go back and have more fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara G\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Edwards\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids!

We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don’t single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don’t put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It’s not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome for kids, especially during hot days.

It’s a great space/had great coffee and was such a fun afternoon. However my 18 month old got something similar to hand foot and mouth from here and it’s been a horribly miserable experience that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. She had a fever for six days in a row and we’re now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they’re sick. Again this is not anything against Playland we’d happily return but a psa to the parents because what we went through was really miserable! Keep your sick kids at home please.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Crawford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun, cute place for little ones! Super clean.

I loved that the tables are close enough so that I can constantly keep an eye on my child while she is playing. At other indoor play areas it’s hectic and smaller kids are constantly getting ran over by older kids. I loved that Playland’s space was calming and less stressful. I also love how this area is made for smaller kids and my child can play at ease without the fear of getting pushed down/ran over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Savanna Ziskind\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a fun morning at Playland Lake Norman. We normally visit the Monroe location, but decided to visit this one for my daughter’s 3rd birthday. It was such a fun experience for her and us as parents. This location isn’t as crowded or busy and it’s smaller so it wasn’t as overwhelming. I could see my daughter no matter where she went and it was great. She could climb everything and loved it. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and well managed! My 5 year old stayed busy and had a blast. The coffee is fantastic and everything is reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sisco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dallas Clifford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love bringing my kids here.

Was just thrown off a little as a table of guests brought in some horrid smelling takeout (squids/ fish and what not) they ate it throughout the playplace and played with toys while carrying some food on forks and in their hand. A few of the staff watched and said nothing, I'm sure I've read no outside food allowed. The smell alone was off putting and I'm sure disrupting the tables around them, never mind the bags of other items they had. We've never been on a weekend and it was nice to see so many kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jason Currie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Kids have a blast every time they go!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Renee S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 months ago\nReview: We’ve been to Tiny Town dozens of times, and it never gets old. My son insists on wearing their tiny penguin outfit every visit because, in his words, it’s a “fancy vacation” and feels like stepping into a brand-new city - apparentl, every vacation deserves a penguin suit?!? The staff do a great job keeping things organized, even with all the moving pieces—it can get a little out of sorts, but that’s part of the fun.\nLet’s talk about the real hidden gem: the bathrooms, which are always spotless. You could walk in with just socks and not think twice (though they do provide slides if you’re feeling fancy). Always a great time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristi Walker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Had my daughter’s 2nd birthday here and it was just perfect!

Old school charm with new age toys. Excellent for younger children. I brought my 6 year old and 9 year old. Although my 9 year old had fun, she definitely mentioned to me how \"old\" she felt playing here.\nI found the place disorganized despite the staff constantly trying to clean up after the kids. It's definitely a challenge at all these types of places to have enough toys for all kids, especially when some kids \"hoard/hog\" the toys for themselves and their parents don't intervene with \"sharing\" concepts. It's something kids just have to deal with.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Eden Chapin\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This is a cute idea for a kids play place, pretty well executed. I thought the incorporation of things like jumbo building blocks and toy vehicles into the “make believe you’re in a tiny town” theme was a nice touch, and it meant that my two-year old, who isn’t much interested in imaginative play yet, could still have a great time. I also appreciated the infant area.\n\nMy major complaint is that the “no-outside-food” policy is unnecessary and makes me unlikely to come here frequently. There’s a well-defined area for eating, and there’s no reason a family couldn’t enjoy a packed lunch there, so I assume the idea is to force me to spend more money at their cafe. But when I saw that the cafe was basically only offering fast food and empty calorie snacks I became pretty unexcited about that option. Small children are notoriously picky eaters as well as frequent snackers. So, when a business specifically aimed at children intentionally frustrates our eating routines just to shake another $5 out of me for a greasy slice of pizza, it’s a huge turn-off.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vishal Rathi\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Smaller business, but decent space for small gatherings. Parking availability is okay, but toys are older and visibly wearing out.\nI understand outside food won’t be allowed in places like these, but $2.54 for a bottle of water (500ml) from Costco is a little too harsh for the buyers inside.\nAdults paying for their presence inside again because they have to wait, and entering their names date of birth etc for that is a little too many questions asked.\nOverall, I would not possibly come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vahini Basu\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: It's a great place and my son just loves it.

It's a large space where kids can play dress up and make believe in various places in town. My kid loves it. However, as a parent, this place is a nightmare.\n\n1) It's always crowded. This may be a zoning issue where the City has licensed them for people than the facility should hold. Sometimes it's so crowded, kids can't enjoy themselves without fighting and trampling over each other.\n\n2) The staff here are always rude. I don't know why, regardless of when you go or how you contact them (phone or email), they're not helpful.\n\n3) The cleanliness of this place is questionable.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natasha George\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: This is a cute place but could definitely use some improvements. I find it difficult for kids to play. For example, when I arrived, all of the shopping carts and food from the grocery store were in other areas throughout the town. I spent a lot of time cleaning up so that my child could play.  There was only one staff member who was scrambling to tidy up each room. I think limiting the number of families for a time slot could improve the experience. Most of the wooden Melissa & Doug toys have a lot of wear which is understandable as the toys have been handled by so many. Definitely a bit chaotic for my organized family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laks Selva\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: Cute but it gets chaotic when events are held.

Our son is 16 months old and really enjoyed exploring the various curated rooms and the space itself. It’s thoughtfully designed with each room having a theme, and toys/items that go along with it. He spent most of his time in the animal/vet and flower/grocery shop rooms.\n\nThey have staff there going around and returning items and toys that have been left out, so it’s well maintained. It was clean and we really liked the no shoe policy.\n\nThe only drawback was that it got extremely busy about 40 minutes after opening (it was a Saturday morning so to be expected), and there were a lot of older children just running around.\n\nOverall, we had a good time and we’ll be back to play again!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Na Per\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun spot for the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Slava Peker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place to take kids under the age of 7.

Only one staff member at the front that also runs the limited food stop, e.g. microwaved pizza. Most of the parents don't watch their kids. The kids don't clean up after themselves and are grabbing stuff from other kids or just throwing toys around, so toys are in different rooms. My kiddo likes organization so we ended up tidying up after the other kids. A fair amount of broken stuff, e.g. baby strollers and cars, and for how long they've been in business, I don't think most of the stuff was purchased new as there is significant wear and tear.\n\nSome of the kids stuff is on the low end, e.g. the cheaper kids kitchens. Kids aren't washing their hands after using the bathroom but that's not on the facility. There is signage to use hand sanitizer but the wall mounted one isn't just finished, it has nothing inside. There was also a coughing kid that was touching everything. Surprised they didn't tell them to come back when they're not sick.\n\nOverall, we just made sure we all washed our hands after.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: megan kenaraki\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Word of advice, read the 1 star reviews before you decide to have a party here because you will experience much of the frustrations that a lot of people are sharing here. Despite these comments, the owner doesn't make any effort to improve customers' experience.\nI have been a long-time customer of this establishmen. However,  during a recent conflict they showed their true colours. The management lacks conflict resolution skills and don't really care about the issues you raise to them, insisting their positions and then tend to gaslight you. They are rude, and instead of having an open discussion, they prefer you go away and they hung up on me on the first point of contact. Even though they say they welcome constructive criticism and honest feedback!! Please note I wasn't even asking for compensation. However, their rude and dismissive attitude was absolutely reflecting of these comments here. It's very disappointing and be assured that I will never recommend this place to anyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sepideh Ziaei\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super cute space for kids. They have a seating area in the middle of the play space /mini rooms. The themes are all awesome. Cute little plane, too w/cockpit\nThey have coffee, tea, and snacks. They do serve fast food. Also, drinks for the littles.\nI don't like the wide age range allowance. I think it should be only for Infant-8 years old.\n\nThe staff are all\nFriendly. The space is very clean and tidy. Bathrooms are clean and very kid equipped.\n\nThey have multiple party rooms! 🥳 it can get super busy in the evenings and weekends with parties.\n\nWe love going. 20$ for no time limit.

Not sure I will be returning unfortunately.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dorian Kolinas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We recently celebrated our son’s first birthday at Tiny Town Vaughan. We rented the venue exclusively for our guests which made it super comfortable for both the children and adults that joined our celebration. We had children from all ages between 1-14yrs and they all had a great time. The older children engaged in dress-up play with the younger children. The adults enjoyed themselves as well, knowing they could allow their children to roam and explore freely in a safe and clean space that was exclusively for our guests. Amanda (Red) did an excellent job setting up a beautiful party room and ensuring all went smoothly throughout the evening… she truly went above and beyond! Amanda (Red) and Amanda were both extremely helpful prior to the party, helping me coordinate a perfect event. Diana, the owner of Tiny Town, also owns Caledon Ballons and created the beautiful ballon decor for our party. The Ballons still look gorgeous weeks later! We also kept the coffee bar open for our guests which seemed to be a hit! All in all, it was a perfect venue for our son’s first birthday celebration. The space accommodated our 75 guests of all ages comfortably and everyone had a great time. It is a wonderful space to host a child’s birthday party of this grandeur.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mariam Aywas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dorian Molinari\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Super cute little town for children to play.

It’s perfect for ages 2-5. A lot of different areas to play in and sliders to slide around. When you book a party there are multiple parties going on, so expect there to be a lot of kids! We got there quite early and it was clean, until all the kids showed up! Bathrooms were also clean.\nFood is limited there so eat before you go.\nI do highly recommend because my kids loved it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natasha Ramnarine\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute little play place that we attended for a birthday party. It was great for kids of all ages. There are different rooms with activities and costumes, a road with vehicles to drive, and a construction area. Each room represents a different building in the town (restaurant, salon, grocery store, etc). There is also an infant area with toys and activities for babies under 1 to play with. Just beside the play rooms there are tables and chairs for parents to sit at while their kids play. The bathrooms were big and clean. Diaper changing stations for baby, potty seats and a step stool at the sink are available and so convenient. No strollers are allowed in the play area, we left ours in the coat room. Everyone must wear socks (adults too). We attended for a private event, but there is also a drop-in play option. For drop ins there is a snack bar where snacks and refreshments can be purchased. There are 3 party rooms available. Parking is free outside the building and everything is on the main level. I will definitely be back with my kids .\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamie Mora\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: lowes sophia (lowessophia)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Xinyi Z\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Excellent activity space for children of all ages.

Great baby section. It was clean. We stayed till closing time and she cleaned up very nicely. She also explained they sanitize the toys every time. My new fave spot.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamil Hasmani\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very clean and fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vincent\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Antonio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Attended a party today, staff were very friendly, very clean space, party rooms are big and spacious.

First time coming and I thought we can arrive and pay. She told me that I have to buy the tickets on line. So I went back into the car to do that. Once I was done. I came back in she let the group in front of me pay right on the spot. I asked her why did she tell me we had to pay online. Her response was that it was 11:30 and were about to close in 1.5 hrs. We can take payments now.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Raeesa Lallani\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Held our children’s joint 1st / 3rd birthday party here and would definitely recommend.\n\nStaff were very friendly, quickly placed toys back to where they belong and assisted with clean up. Ideally, the set-up time would be longer then 15 mins but because the rooms are at the back it allowed us to continue setting up while the guests were arriving without interfering with their play time.\n\nOverall, our guests had a great time and this is a unique venue to host a birthday party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mirella Di natdo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gurpreet K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Farwa Fatima\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Extremely rude staff.

There is no gate or any sense of security, so anyone could pick up a child and walk out with them. There should be a gate, or wristband system, or security who will make sure every child who walks out is walking out with the right people. Of course parents should always watch their kids, but there should definitely be another layer of protection since there's lots of small children. Other than that great experience :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pardeep Bhachu\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for hour of fun for young children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexandra Hanna\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It’s actually fun here\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hooman Loghman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Katsaros\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amazing experience celebrating by son's 5th birthday!

There were big messes in every room, and it was a bit overstimulating for my toddler.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louise Malisani\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A very unique place. So well done. It has something for all interest and ages. The place is well organized for children to explore and use their imagination.

Will be back again for sure\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mavis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a great experience at Tiny town. I read some of the reviews and decided it was best to go in the morning, right when they opened. It was great. My daughter had so much fun she did not want to leave. The place was clean, it was not busy so my daughter had lots of space to go from room to room. It started to get busy around 10:30am.\n\nBathrooms were clean, staff were friendly. I have no complaints and will be visiting again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sandy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Amazing experience both visits! Great service and very clean.

If you go after 4pm the toys will be everywhere on the ground except where they belong to, because nobody put them back. They let way too many kids in during weekends so overall experiene was not good. I doubt if they every clean the toys. Lots of them already feel sticky. Should have just had the party at home. Dont waste your money here.\nMy daughter started having a fever after the party, hightly likely due to the crowds (one kid threw up there) and dirty toys.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natasha Singh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids enjoyed the venue.  The pictures from the website made it seem bigger than it was, just a note. The toys, in particular the baby section, could use a good cleaning. But the overall place was clean and well managed. I didn't try the food but they had a small selection that was good enough including fries.}",

We came from Fairfax because we got summer reading coupons from our public library for this place. We’re having a wonderful time. Large, clean, spacious, and something for children of all ages. Everything is winter themed. Nice temp controlled place to play during very hot/cold weather  There are separated areas for 0-2s and 2-7s, birthday party rooms, bathrooms, and a lot more. There are bar chairs, high table tops, and soft benches for adults. The staff was very kind and professional. The price includes unlimited play time.  You need to wear socks to enter (they sell them too). Looking forward to coming back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Qazi Mahmood\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: Best place for kids to play and have fun 😊.

They have a 10% military discount and all the staff was friendly. We were there when it opened and it got a bit crowded by the time we left at noon, but it was fun, safe, and a great way to beat the heat 🥵\nAC was nice and cool and they let you bring in your kid's snacks and food which was really nice. They even have little counter seating so you can still watch the kids play and work on a laptop or eat a meal. We will definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kim Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 days ago\nReview: Here for a birthday party and the kids are having a great time.

One isn’t interchangeable with the other, but one definitely enhances the other if that makes sense. The place was clean; ESPECIALLY THE BATHROOMS🤯😅🎯. But most importantly it is a fun and SAFE environment. As a matter of fact I’m writing this as I’m watching my 2 daughters navigate the rope bridge ; complete with imaginary lava!😅 And I’m able to comfortably supervise from the sidelines and still take 3-5 minutes to write this review. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed!💯💯💯\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Ocon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 days ago\nReview: Love it here.

The place is clean and has a bunch of space to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelia Calabro\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: The ages for each section is not adhered to and staff do not enforce the rules.  Older children in the toddler and baby areas literally pushing and running over the smaller children. Would not recommend going with a smaller child.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Jamokha\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: My 6 and 4 year old love it here. During spring break my 6 year old was home but I had work so we came here and he played solo for about 5 hours straight. It is very clean, feels super safe and secure. Gets crowded in the weekends but is very manageable in weekdays, even in the evening. My almost 2 year old likes it too and they have a nice separate area for babies, but he likes to wander to the big kid area so it’s a lot more chasing with him. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hiccup-52\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: Super helpful and daughter had a blast\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Feser\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: So- just like every other kid place this business is crazy over stimulating BUT the kids love it and I highly recommend it over Chuckie Cheese or Sky zone. It’s clean, enclosed, parents and kids wear matching wrist bands, and the music isn’t blasting amassing to the general cacophony of kids having fun. It won’t break the bank and your kids can play all day for a flat fee. All in all, much better than typical indoor playgrounds.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Gibson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: Dear John,\n\nThank you for your fantastic rating.

The parents stepped out of the building leaving him in there unattended. While the assistant manager offered to file an incident report that wouldn’t rectify the situation took place. The only solution was if my son got hit again or the boy hit someone again he would be asked to leave. This picture is my sons face today and he’s emotional go out no because he got hit in the face. I feel like this is unacceptable and the child should be removed immediately after assaulting another child and leaving marks on their face.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Barbara Florence\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Dear Barbara,\n\nThank you for your fantastic rating.
