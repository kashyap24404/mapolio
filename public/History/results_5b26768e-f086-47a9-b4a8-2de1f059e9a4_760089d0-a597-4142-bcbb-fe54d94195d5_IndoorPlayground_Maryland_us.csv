Review: I have 4 kids ages 1,5,6 & 7. They all really enjoyed imagining with me. Everything was very clean the staff was friendly and I even seen them cleaning each room periodically during our play time. The only thing I don’t agree with is pricing. I don’t feel parents should be charged 10$. Kids can’t come without parents so I feel like it should be parents get free admission with the purchase of a kids ticket. I paid 90$ for my 4 kids and myself and that’s a little steep and the pricing would be the only thing that would stop me from coming back other than that everything was great! Compared to other kids places in the area they don’t charge extra for parents or children 1 and under.

Review: Imagining with Me is a fantastic new addition to St. Charles County Mall, and it’s exactly what our community needed! There aren’t many places dedicated to young children, so this space is a breath of fresh air. I first heard about it through their social media and was excited to visit. We’ve been several times now, and my son absolutely loves it!

One of the highlights was winning free admission through their social media giveaway—such a fun bonus! The play areas are creative and engaging, with so many opportunities for little ones to explore and use their imagination. My son’s favorite is the science center, which is filled with hands-on activities that introduce STEM concepts in a fun and age-appropriate way. He especially loves the child-sized spaceship!

Personally, I love the restaurant and grocery store play areas. Watching the kids pretend to be chefs, shoppers, and cashiers is such a joy, and it sparks endless creativity. This is a place where children can learn, grow, and create lasting memories. I truly appreciate the effort that went into making Imagining with Me such a special place, and we’ll definitely be back again and again!

Seeing my son and daughter dressed up as doctors, astronauts and chefs was one of the highlights for me. They had so much fun!!! The business owner Keona was also very personable and friendly. Money and time well spent!

Review: Our family had an absolute blast at Joyland kidz! My 3 yr old son and 16-month-old daughter enjoyed every moment. From the moment you walk in, Joyland gives off a fun, energetic vibe that sets the tone for an unforgettable experience. The entire space is clean, safe, and well organized. The kids were entertained the whole time from the exciting slides and bouncing rooms to the interactive play areas. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made sure everyone felt welcomed. Customer service was top-notch, and it’s clear the team truly cares about creating a positive environment for families.

Review: I visited Joyland on 7-1 with my 3 children ages 1, 5, and 8.

Pros:
1. Great location
2. Lots of parking
3. Very clean facility and bathrooms

Cons

1. Young girl working was on her phone as she completed my transaction and answered my questions. It’s nothing more rude than when young people have their AirPods in and are holding two conversations at once. There were times when she was looking at me but talking on her phone.
2. It was 78 degrees inside on a  95 degree day. Their air was set to 64 degrees. I don’t know if it was ventilation issues or AC issues but it was hot. You are not allowed to bring food or drinks inside. They have water fountains but they are near the bathroom (I don’t drink water fountains near bathrooms iykyk) They have a water bottle refill station but you can’t bring bottles in so it doesn’t really make sense.
3. Their price per child no matter what their age, is $15.99 for 2 hours. One adult does enter free with children. There is no different price for younger ages which was shocking to me. HyperKidz and Scramble even have a different price for toddlers vs older children. They also don’t have different weekday prices vs weekend prices.  Paying $16 for a space where my one year old could not even use half of the equipment was unsettling.
4. The space is small. It is the size of the surrounding businesses. I was so happy to have a place close to home but for $16 per child I will take my kids where it is half the price and they actually have more things to do.
5. They require non slip socks. Every indoor playground I have been to requires socks but not non slip socks. The non slip socks are a money grab. They look similar to the sky zone socks but nothing in there is slippery so I really didn’t understand the non slip socks. As I looked around almost every family had them which confirmed for me it was a money grab. Their website also didn’t have the socks under their admissions tab.

I will not be coming back. I really wanted to support a new black owned business but it seems like a money grab for the size and what they have to offer.

Nice, Black owned family here really thought of everything a little needs to have a good time. Clean, well-lit and enough space for kids to play. Only thing I’m not a fan of here is the pet hospital, it’s a bit closed off so it easily becomes the hangout for kids which I frequently walked over to put eyes on my kid. It would be great if they put a window there

Review: I recently came across this kids playcenter for my kids, we visited and let's just say my kids were beyond happy and excited. They had the most amazing time exploring. The space offered a wide range of unique and beautiful play sets for the kids and even adults.

We were even more excited to learn that we could plan our birthday parties and much more here. I am already looking forward to booking and scheduling my son's birthday party here.

This space is a gem in Brandywine and we are so excited that it is here.

There is a large maze with slides and a small ball pit, a toddler playroom, mini arcade (that costs extra per game played), two netted trampolines, and two party rooms.  Both times I’ve been with my son it hasn’t been too busy- enough for him to play with others but not so many that it felt restrictive.  The staff is friendly and helpful- especially Sheryl.  Recommend checking it out if you are in the area.

Best of all, Cheryl greeted us warmly and was attentive to the well being of the children and the cleanliness of the whole space. PG county is hardly known for its high level of customer care, however Cheryl is personally working to change that! The only thing I would change is the music (either more child appropriate music or classical music. No Hip-hop).

Review: This could be a really nice play place, but some safety issues need to be addressed and handled better.

Fun place for ages 3+, but not for toddlers. It can get overwhelming and dangerous. The staff are uninvolved. The flooring in the main play room is warped and easy for kids to trip on.

There is another room in this place with small roller coasters, but it is not set up in a safe way, and again the staff are uninvolved. The roller coaster room was set up in a way where the kids would roll down straight into hard objects and get hurt.

They have fun foam building blocks, but some of them in the mix are unusually heavy. One energetic kid was throwing the foam blocks around, which normally wouldn't be a problem, except that some of them were the heavy ones that could cause injuries (they made a big thud sound when the kid threw them).

All the while, while kids were having fun and getting hurt, the staff were on their phones at the check in desk rather than taking turns checking on the crying kids or helping organize the dangerous messy rooms.

Also, this was at the beginning of August. If the dates on some of the other reviews are correct, the AC was out about 2 weeks ago. It was still not working. Super hot inside.

Review: Beware of booking a party package/room at the PG location. I planned and booked my daughter's 2nd birthday party here one month in advance. The cost to have roughly 25-30 guests in the smaller party room is $350 total. This comes with 2hr room rental, 2 pizzas, and juices for the kiddos. My issue with my booking is that the AIR CONDITIONING was busted for the weekend in the MIDDLE of July 2024. The staff kindly reached out to me the morning of the party to ask which pizza toppings I wanted for the party. (I replied pepperoni and cheese =) I'm in a good mood because it's my daughter's special day) No mention at all regarding the A/C. We arrive to setup for the party and then were told. I have 3 pregnant women and elderly guests attending the party. I was offered $50 off. The staff brought the pizzas but would not give me the pizzas until the balance was settled. I was not settling for just $50 off. The most the manager offered off was $100 and a few free waters for the inconvenience. He/she told the staff that if I wasn't happy with their final offer we would have to exit the party room immediately. So I pay the remaining balance because I'm not trying to get kicked out of the room and completely ruin the day/party. Here is the kicker, both the pizzas are cheese. Like wow lol. All in all, vet other play places for your children so you do not give an establishment your hard-earned money just for them to treat you like trash. I'm rating it a 2 instead of a 1 because one of the employees helped me set my balloon garland up.

Review: I took my children for an outing to have some fun on a Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty crowded and there were lots of parents and kids playing. It was clean as the review stated which was a good thing. My youngest who is one wanted to play in the ball pit however the ball pit is attached in the main area so there were a lot of bigger kids which meant she wasn't able to play. I would definitely suggest putting a ball pit in the toddler room for the children to play with. I also think it would be a good idea to station a staff member in the toddler room to keep the bigger kids out. I would like to see a bit more sanitation going on while the children are there maybe someone walking through periodically and sanitizing the toys because the smaller kids of course like to put things in their mouth no matter how much you try to stop them. The price was decent And there was no time limit which was a good thing. They do have trampolines but they are in a separate room from the play equipment so if you have a child that wants to do trampolines and then a child that wants to climb the jungle gym you're going to have to split your time between both rooms. I would say the bathrooms need a little bit more attention The one that I went into definitely could have used some attention during the day It wasn't completely bad but to have children that need to use the restroom it definitely needs to be cleaned and sanitized at least once every couple of hours. Overall my kids had a good time and the place was clean which was a plus for me, however, you might want to go early in the morning when there's not a lot of kids there if you want your younger children to be able to fully experience everything without being run over by the older kids.

Review: I was at this playground last month and the experience I had wasn't the best. I'm a babysitter and was watching three children. The 3-and-a-half-year-old child accidentally dropped her pretzels on the floor while eating her snack. Then the receptionist came up to me and told me I had to clean up the mess the child had made. She had a vacuum cleaner in her hand and still made a big deal out of it. When I went to see, my child had already cleaned everything up and there were just crumbs on the floor. The receptionist handed me a spray and paper towels and told me to clean up the crumbs, even though she already had the vacuum cleaner in her hand and could just clean the crumbs ( I mean, if someone has an accident in the restroom, will she ask the person to clean the bathroom? That doesn’t make sense, when you have a business you have some responsibility even though you don’t like it) . I don't know if she did this to me because I'm a babysitter, but I'm sure she wouldn't have done what she did to me with any mother present at the playground. I found it unprofessional, and I'll think twice before taking the children to this playground again. It was an unnecessary and humiliating situation, if she is the owner, she should improve. That's not how you treat your customers. The playground itself is nice but not very big. Perfect for ages 2 to 7.

Review: My 2 and 5 year old had a great time. The lay out makes it easy for parents to supervise. On Friday they charge the weekend and holiday rate, which isn’t apparent from the information on their website / front desk.

Review: My Daughter and I visited Junior’s on Monday while school was closed and weather was abysmal. The facility is clean and well organized. There was a front room with large trampolines and a basketball hoop. The middle room had the large climbing  area with plenty of space for many children and seating for adults. The back room was a toddler space. There were a few rooms decorated for birthdays. We stayed for about 2 hours and my daughter enjoyed every minute. We will definitely be going back! It was the perfect snowy day play place!

Review: So happy to have this place close by! Friendly staff and great equipment. My 22-month-old had a great time. Only suggestion would be to try to better keep the toddler room only for little kids, but know that’s hard to enforce!

Can be hard to find from metro/inside, but it’s right next to Ulta and there was plenty of close parking in the lot.

Great price too - the cost allows for all day access, including leaving and coming back!

RECOMMEND going when it's cooler outside so the inside is not.hott. my guess is the ac is either not working right or it was on low. Someone said maybe the ac couldn't keep up with heat idk. - 2 stars

Over all they added more stuff to do than family fun place.  It's still one big area to climb and few moon bounces. -1 star

Older kids came in about 12, of course no fault.to them they just run around no supervision. So it is time to go.

Review: Nice place but wouldn’t recommend for a birthday party.
There are no hosts working party rooms, one employee working front desk on a busy Saturday when there’s a party. Very disorganized. In their birthday package they say they will decorate the party room for you. I dropped the party decor off a day before the party to still see a box of banners and decor unused. The night prior I asked them to set it all up. I was assured they would. I got there 10 minutes after the booked party time only to be told I can set it up how I want. How will I decorate when there’s already guests there and I have children to entertain? So now I wasted money on decorations I can’t use. We had to find the employee and ask for the party bags since people were leaving (these & popcorn are included in the package we got) Seems to be a shortage of staff issue. The employee there however were very nice and it’s a fun environment for kids but definitely would not recommend a party to be held there because of our experience.

It even included goodie bags which I didn’t pay attention to, but it just made for double the treats for our guests. The staff were polite and professional. Ahead of the party communication was very clear and professional as well. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience. It wasn’t just your average kid party venue rental. At Action Jaxx you really get a wonderful party experience. We opted to add on a character and the interaction and engagement with the kids was amazing. They had little activities and games planned and the announcements over the speaker system were a great touch. My son has not stopped talking about his party and that’s really all I could ask for. I would highly recommend Action Jaxx !

They have a toddler area but our little ones were more interested in the bigger slides and obstacle courses.  They had a blast for over 2 hours.  We will definitely be returning. The staff was also super polite and informative. 👍

From the ease of booking to the patience from the staff with our questions before the party and Devin who helped during the party it was superior customer service.  We really felt like we were in good hands and it never felt rushed.  Our daughter and friends all had a great time.  They even turned on a bubble machine that the kids loved.  We had kids ranging from toddlers to 10 and they were all able to play.  We will be back fro free play and would definitely recommend them to others.  They even decorate the room for you and provide everything you need in the party room.We couldn’t be happier.

Many thanks to the amazing team at Action Jaxx who were so easy to work with from reservation all the way to closing the day of the party. My child and friends had a great time. Everything’s clean, organized and there’s games for all ages (toddler to old school video game consoles). The facilities are just the right size, not overwhelming like other humongous playgrounds where you have 5 birthdays happening at once, you can keep an eye on your kids virtually from anywhere and it’s non stop fun. The crew set the birthday room up to perfection AND then took care of all the cleaning. Highly recommend.

Review: We had so much fun celebrating my daughters first birthday here during free play! My fiancé and I felt like a kid again. This place is a bounce house with a toddler area but it’s main attraction is the moon bounces which isn’t really baby friendly but nonetheless we had a blast. We wanted to try something other than scramble and I’m so glad we did. Don’t bring your baby if they can’t walk though. It can be a hassle. We have a crawler. Whew!! It does get really hot too but the beverage machine can fix that. My daughters loved the bubbles and slides. My crawler loved the toddler section. Only thing I would fix is the AC, as it can get really sweaty especially if you’re playing with the kids. We had a blast and we’ll be back once baby can walk.

Review: We attended Open Play on a Saturday morning. The staff was very friendly and the whole place was very clean. The kids had an awesome time. The only thing that could improve is the way the entrance is monitored. There should be some way to keep kids safer. The exit/entrance gets very crowded between checking families in and birthday parties coming and going. There's no real system to ensure that kids don't leave the area alone or with strangers. It gets tough if you bring more than one kid.

Review: I had a birthday party this past Sunday at Action Jaxx reserved for 2 hours in the party room. However, it's only really for 90 minutes because they use the last 30 minutes to kick you out to clean for the next party.  So my party was rushing to get out after we paid for 2 hours. Don't get me wrong the kids had a good time playing I just would not book another party there. Action Jaxx needs more party rooms so parties don't  feel rushed  after paying for two hours. Maybe schedule build in times for clean between parties so people can get the full two hours. Great place for kids to play just not for birthday parties for the money you pay. P.S. Bring your own goody bags:)

They did all of the setting up, all of the cleaning up. Everything was super clean and Chris was so accommodating. I give this place 5 stars. We had every age from baby crawlers to 10yr old & there was something for every one to play with for the entire time! I think the adults had just as much fun as the kids…. I made a joke that this place would be extra awesome for “parents night out” with an open bar 😂😂😂😂😂😂. Seriously though, 5 stars all the way around 👏🏻 THANKS CHRIS!!

Review: Definitely not worth the cost, not only is it dirty and dark inside, but they play music with curse words in it and they charged me, an adult, full price to “play” with my toddler. She can barely get up the steps by herself and even if she could she just turned 3 she’s not going to play by herself and I wouldn’t make her do that either... I paid it only because we were already there, but we won’t be coming back cause that place isn’t worth over $30.. I’ve been to majesticland, funspot, scramble, kidzden, beehive, and hyperkidz and not once have been charged to play with her and they all have way more to offer for the kids and are brighter and cleaner with kid music playing.

Review: We recently hosted a birthday party at Action Jaxx. The website indicates 2 hours of non stop fun for the package we selected. Little did I know, it didn’t include 2 hours in the party room. I found out 3 days prior that access to the party room is only for 1.5 hours of the 2 hour timeframe and this was because I called the center to confirm other details.

I received a text the night before indicating the same. Extending my time was not an option and at this point it was too late to cancel.

We arrived at the center 20 minutes early and was only allowed access to the room at the time the party started. Once we entered, they were still setting up the room.

The day of, the owner, Kris, seemed annoyed with being asked questions or for clarification on certain things and was avoiding dealing with me and always directed me to the party host instead.

Everything was rushed. We literally had to eat in a jiffy, sing happy birthday quickly and get out of there for them to set up for another birthday party.

All in all, this is a great spot for kids to have fun but I would not recommend hosting a birthday party unless they adjust some things (set up and break down time, extending party room time, etc.) or be clear about specific details on their website. As well as, be more approachable with customers.

It was a terrible experience from an adult perspective but my son and his friends enjoyed themselves.

Review: I had my sons 1st birthday party there this Saturday. I enjoyed every moment of it from booking the party to the end of the party. They were available for any questions I had and they took care of everything. The kids had so much fun and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I would even bring my son here on a regular day to play. If you’re looking for somewhere fun to take your kids for the day or somewhere to book a party, Action Jaxx is the way to go.

Review: I didn’t come here for a party. It was just a play date, and I really wanted to like this place because the kids had an amazing time. But I can’t overlook the condition of the facility.

Everything about the place feels old, dingy, and unsanitary. Several play structures were literally held together with duct tape. The ball pit had balls with missing foam or foam completely exposed. There’s also a slide that goes straight down into a pole, which doesn’t seem like the safest design.

What really pushed me over the edge was the bathroom. The smell hit me the second I opened the door. It smelled like urine that had been sitting for days. Toilet paper was all over the floor, and not a single surface felt clean enough to touch. I couldn’t even bring myself to walk in. It was just too disgusting. 🤢

If management put some effort into repairs and basic cleaning, this could be a great spot for kids. But until that happens, I won’t be coming back. You’re better off going to Hyper Kidz or Chuck E. Cheese.

Review: This place is basically the Dollar Tree version of Hyper Kidz. The entire setup looks like it’s being held together with Scotch tape. Everything felt dingy, worn down, and just tired.

The girl at the front desk had the customer service energy of someone at the DMV, not exactly welcoming or helpful.

The equipment? Faded, patched-up, and dirty, and don’t let the bright colors fool you, nothing felt clean, safe, or well-maintained. If this is your first time here, make it your last. Matter of fact.. Save your money.

Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks at a real indoor play center. Your kids deserve better.

Review: We had my niece’s birthday party at Play EC in Capitol Heights. The kids had a great time on the jungle gym and play areas, but the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The party room wasn’t available until 4 p.m. even though the party was scheduled for 2:30, which was frustrating. The space is small and felt overcrowded on a busy Saturday.

It was hot inside, especially in the back where the air doesn’t circulate well. The facility could be cleaner—dust triggered my allergies, and there were items stored under the jungle gym. Staff seemed limited—only three people on site, including the manager.

They did provide pizza, juice, and handled setup, and the decor was nice, though clearly reused. Be careful with helium balloons—if one floats to the ceiling, they’ll charge up to $150 to retrieve it or you can risk your safety and try to get it down yourself, they will provide the ladder for you.

It’s probably best to go during a weekday or rent the full space if you’re planning a party. Great for kids, but not the most comfortable for adults.

Now, the two young ladies working had excellent customer service and tried to make us comfortable. I really appreciate their help.

Review: SCAMMERS!!!
We booked a birthday party at this establishment for 5:30 PM and paid $600 in advance, as required. However, we arrived at 5:47 PM and were shocked to find that we had to wait nearly two hours for a party room to become available. Despite paying for a private room for two full hours, we were not given access to a room until 7:30 PM. To make matters worse, the manager informed us that we had to vacate by 7:45 PM—after receiving only 15 minutes of use.

The experience was completely unacceptable. The pizza provided was cold, and the drinks were old Capri Sun juice boxes. This is not what we paid for, and certainly not what was advertised.

As a Black woman supporting a Black-owned business, I expected professionalism, respect, and accountability. Unfortunately, this experience confirmed why many hesitate to support our own—because some businesses treat paying customers as if their money and time don’t matter. I feel disrespected, disappointed, and frankly scammed out of $600 for a service that was never properly delivered.

For comparison, Chuck E. Cheese charges $200 less and honors their time slots. Even if you arrive late, they simply deduct that time from your reservation—they don’t force you to wait two hours for a room you already paid for.

This business failed to meet basic expectations and left my family and guests feeling disregarded. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously so that no other family has to go through what we experienced.

Review: This place was a travesty! There were mounds of trash at the back door, clearly visible to customers. The floors were filthy, and kids in the play area were spilling drinks and food everywhere. Big kids were running over the little ones, and I almost had to intervene in a fight between two boys who looked to be around 13. I didn’t see any staff on the floor enforcing the rules. It truly has potential, but it falls short in many important areas.

Review: I’m giving this place one star solely because my child enjoyed coming here BEFORE we booked a party. However, I can confidently say this is not a 4-star establishment—don’t be misled by Google reviews. Many of the honest 1-star reviews can be found on Yelp.
The management is unprofessional, greedy, and show no appreciation for their guests. My party décor was nothing like what I requested, and both the party host and management were rude and dismissive. After the event, I sent a polite and professional email regarding my deposit, only to receive nothing but disrespect and unprofessional back-and-forth responses, as if I were arguing with a child.
They claim they’ve made “upgrades”—absolutely not. The facility still smells like feet, the foam pit cubes are falling apart and unsanitary, and to top it off, the entire place reeked of weed as we were leaving. They don’t have enough staff to monitor guests, so anyone can come and go freely, creating a safety concern.
Despite advertising that the space is for kids 8 years and younger, there were older, rough-playing kids who posed a risk to younger children. They also claim to provide waivers and wristbands for safety, but that wasn’t enforced at all.
To make matters worse, the candy wall décor contained old, stale, and hard candy—and this was during my party!
If you're considering booking a party here, think twice. They make up their own rules, have no regard for customer satisfaction, and will take your money without delivering the promised experience. I truly regret spending my hard-earned money here and not receiving my deposit back. Beware before booking! I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: It was so crowded and so many children over the age of 8 on the equipment around toddlers I saw one baby bust his lip because he got pushed by the whale swings and landed right in front of the slides while someone was coming down 😢, I came to celebrate my baby’s 2 birthday frozen theme they didn’t use my balloons just the previous party balloons for the garland, It was unorganized, late for party reservations and then rush you out the room, play area unsanitary and old, not worth the money $580 I’m going to see if I get my $150 deposit back like they said and then I’ll be back to inform you guys on that…I gave a 2 star because I loved the room setting in the party room and because I came here before on a week night and nobody was here so it was a beautiful and amazing experience for my 2 year old I live close by and I’ll still take her to get her sleepy for bed but i highly doubt I will do another party

Update: I received my $150 deposit and they called to get a better of my issues so that it won’t happen again in the future… and again it’s a nice place on the weekday for children under 8 years old thank you

Review: ***PLEASE BE AWARE, DO NOT BOOK A PARTY HERE!!! I booked the birthday package for my daughter's 3rd birthday and it was a disaster from the moment we walked in. The facility was overcrowded, and my 3 year old couldn't even play on the equipment. You don't get access to the room until it's time to eat in which they didn't mention. I had countless emails and phone calls with the party director. They tried to get me to pay for extra adults beforehand, saying it was going to be at capacity that day. Glad I didn't, because it was already at capacity. The party host was lazy and couldnt answer any of our concerns. The pizza we received was cold and looked like they dropped it on the floor. There was no manager in sight and no one answered any of my calls or texts until weeks later and even then the best they could offer was passes to come back! I would never patronize this place! Do not waste your time or money! Do not waste your time or money! We could've went to Chuckie Cheese instead of wasting of time and energy! Oh and i'm still waiting on my deposit back and my event was over 3 weeks ago. I wouldn't allow my child to go back if it was free. The owners ought to be ashamed of themselves

Review: The worse place I've been to for a kid's party. No organization, over crowded, and rides were taped up with duck tape. This in NOT a safe place for toddlers. You have bigger kids playing and swinging on the rides that shouldn't even be on them. This place is beyond dangerous and I most certainly will not be returning. My nephew had to be rushed to the hospital for stitches after being busted in the head as he was walking pass ride. He was hit in the head by a metal piece that was covered in duct tape. Upon us calling the ambulance, we asked the worker for the address and she had to find it on paperwork. They weren't concerned nor sympathetic for his injury. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!

Review: Unfortunately this place has gone way down hill. Due to poor management of rules, the equipment is falling apart. Anyplace that has EC in the title needs to stick to that. EC means early childhood and that is 8 and under. Huge children that were bigger than me on the equipment. I watched something break. Then parents are belligerent trying to provoke fights. Yelling and cursing at you if you go to management simply to tell them their equipment broke because they didn’t see. Not coming back.

Review: Overall, I like the concept of this play place. There is supposed to be an age cap for the range of children allowed to use the space and get on the activity play set-ups. My grandson is two and highly enjoys going to this place.  It's Maryland's best kept secret. The only con is that when they have birthday parties, there are sometimes older children who attend. They're too big for the play area and it's already a small space. In my opinion, it takes away from the younger children being able to fully immerse themselves in the space. When they do birthday parties, maybe they should consider charging for a few hours to rent out the entire space just for the party and close it off to the public until the party is over. The last time I was there with my grandson , it was a mixture of party goers and outside kids and it was a mess. The other children who are not a part of the party are left out and see the party favors and set up and are limited to their play time but the party kids have access to it all. This causes confusion. Other than that , it's a great place to take younger kids maybe 2-6 to play.

Review: My wife took the kids there to play because it was raining and couldn't go to six flags instead. Initially my oldest had to use a bathroom but wasn't planning on playing there but since our middle child started to run around and jump around a bit the front desk came up and demanded that we pay for our kids. We thought ok that's fine since our middle started to play but they demand that we pay full price for our youngest too... My youngest is only 10 months old. So service from this place is trash.
Next from the pictures it seems big but don't let it fool you, I guess because it was raining the place was packed, to the point where the kids could barely move around. We felt as if they had definitely over packed this place and didn't follow the max occupancy just to an extra buck.
Lastly the place is nasty, I don't know when was the last time they cleaned this place or even if it's been clean at all. Not to mention the smell of some illicit substance. I don't know if they have someone using that in the bad or what but we can definitely smell it. So overall this place is not worth the $15 per child. Customer service sucks, over crowded, and the place is filthy and smells. So I would pick another place to take your kids.
Last thing I want to mention I don't know if there was a change of ownership but if you look at most of the recent reviews they are all 1 star vs the review from 2 years ago. Food for thought.

Review: Paying $400 for a party here is honestly not worth it at ALL. you get 2 hours but only allowed in the room for 40 mins. so basically youre paying $400 for 40 mins in a room, a backdrop of the theme, 3 pizzas , some juice, paper plates and napkins. you can spend the same amount throwing your own party at home with MORE stuff literally.My main problem was I booked & paid for a specific room & they did not give me the room i paid for. Instead gave it to another party & gave me a completely different room. Some of the equipment needs maintenance or to be fixed. They have nets that are completely RIPPED OPEN, where a child can literally fall through it & hurt themselves.

Review: I usually don’t write review but don’t book your kids party here I didn’t read review but I am glad I canceled or they would have ruined my son 1 st birthday ! I booked in hopes of a painless birthday but the description doesn’t match what really going to happen if you book at 2-5 you aren't able to access the room until 3pm which is dumb because the site states if you want  additional time to book an extra hour this place is money hungry like the comment state run!!! I was trying to avoid reviews but here I am ! I am so glad I listen to my spirt and when you call reps on the phone are rude and disrespectful and never know anything

Review: Went to a Birthday party there yesterday, Everything was like a 50/50 good/bad experience .
They had him in a little corner behind the trampoline with little to no light. The setup was adorable with the little cute chairs they had. The pizza was delicious but the environment could use better sanitation they could improve this by just having ppl purchase their socks instead. They should also start looking at replacing some of their stuff in there as they are getting worn out.

Despite the mess I've seen my kids enjoyed themselves and I had to drag my youngest out lol

It's limited space so mentally prepare yourself parents cause at some point it will annoy you. I can see in better weather I would just leave my stuff in the car.  There are seats for adults nearby to watch your kids as you should.

Review: Horrible experience for me! $400 for 40 minutes in a private space.  The place is very crowded and they over book! The workers don’t let you into your room until a hour later after your scheduled time. They interrupt your room to take down decorations more than 20 minutes before the time is up. Snatched table clothes off the table while babies are eating.  Very unprofessional. Don’t bring your kids here you will highly regret! THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION based on MY experience, do what you please

Review: I attended a party for my niece today and I was completely dissatisfied with the customer service. Not only was the party booked and paid for from 2-4 , we could not access the party room until 3. We had to quickly set up and around 3:30 the workers started taking the table cloths, and backdrop while we were still celebrating. This day was supposed to be about celebrating my niece but we were quickly rushed out. The workers were rude, and unorganized and I truly didn’t appreciate them cutting the party short. I will no longer attend here, and it’s disheartening to see a business run like this.

Review: Upon arrival, we were directed into the paly area for our 1 of paly time. In your disclosure your company states that you “provide a safe and stimulating environment for kids 8 and under to explore because we truly believe that growing up should be a memorable experience for every child.”. However, this was NOT the case on Sunday, there were multiple kids above the maximum age and weight limit who were filliping, spinning diving and jumping of the equipment and bumping into my one and two year old babies. The children were unsupervised and there was no staff to regulate play. I had to step in and stop rough play to keep my party’s babies safe. The condition and cleanliness of the equipment and play area was also unsanitary, unsafe, and broken. There was an event of a child vomiting (which is normal due to running around) however the facility did not have the proper cleaning supplies to aid the mess. There weren’t any trash bags, no disinfectant, no clothes, no mop nothing that could sanitize the area to continue play. My family and I had to help clean the entire surface area because of the short staffing. Even after surface cleaning, we had to continue to encourage shutting down that specific area due to lack of disinfectant treatment to that area. When directed back to our party room there was a walkway full of cake, water and just spilled the entire walkway, all my guest and children walker in socks and were subject to stepping in the filth on the ground. The “Swiffer used to clean the walkway after it was brought to staffing attention was not efficient as it did not have the proper size cleaning pad.  The rest rooms were unsanitary and had food and trash everywhere. The facility was not cleaned regularly during playtime.

During the celebration in the party room, we were not provided“ trained party host to ensure a stress-free experience” as stated in the companies. There were not enough napkins, plates, no utensils for the guest. All of which had to be retrieved upon consistent requests. The chairs and tables were filthy, torn and not in presentable condition. I cannot stress enough the lack of staffing we experienced at this facility. I was under the impression that there would be a capacity limit at which I know were not carefully monitored because the individuals in my party as well as incoming guest were not accounted for. The “memorable, safe, clean and courteous” environment promised for the amount myself and husband had to pay for our daughter wasn’t not delivered at this facility. My daughters first birthday experience as well as our guest was ultimately ruined.

NEVER AGAIN, OVERPRICED UNPROFESSIONAL AND BEYONG FILTHY.

Review: Staff was pleasant. Location was small. Pretty dirty everywhere I looked (I went through all the attractions b4 my kid to inspect) all the extra toys were old and grimy.
Kids had an ok time but they got bored really quick. This place is pretty much for babies and toddlers so don’t take any child over 3

Since My original review this place has STEPPED THEIR GAME UP! I’ll be honest, I only re-visited because it’s cheap and was still somewhat entertaining for my 1 & 4 yr olds.
But I was pleasantly surprised when we did🫶🏾
Way more attractions and much cleaner than before. They had newer toys and better snacks even. I’m happy to continue supporting this business because they seem like they are taking the upkeep of their facilities more seriously now. Thank you 🙏🏾

I only gave 4 stars because there is a support beam in the middle of the room that they positioned a tall slide right in front of😬😅
The slide itself is a 3 seater so the beam only blocks one. I just make sure my children don’t use that slide because it’s dangerous.
The inertia built up (even by a kid) coming down that thing could legit snap a neck😳

Other than that though perfect for a night of “letting them tire themselves out”
👌🏾

Review: I had my granddaughters 1st birthday at this facility and it was poorly kept. The toys had dirt marks on them, were they were poorly maintained and hadn't been cleaned in awhile. The bathroom for the general crowd hadn't been cleaned and smelled horrible. The bathroom that was in the party room (which the young lady at the front desk escorted us only. I thought she was the hostess as well, but i guess you dont get one) was full of tissue and feces. So we had no bathroom to use. It wasn't safe as well because one of the slides had a pole at the end of the slide, so you would slide right into it. Unsafe and poorly maintained.

Review: We visited Kids Emporium in Glen Allen on Thursday afternoon (July 3rd), and I’m so glad we found this gem! I went with my brother’s family and a friend, and our kids—ranging from 4 to 11 years old—had the BEST time. Between the glow-in-the-dark dance room, awesome slides, race cars, and claw machines, there was something for everyone. They played for hours and left happy (and tired)!

The space is wonderfully clean and well-organized, with plenty of comfortable seating for parents to relax while the kids play. I really appreciated the separate infant area, which makes it feel safe and thoughtfully designed for all age groups. There’s also a little snack bar with a great variety of kid-friendly snacks like go-gurts, juices, cookies, and chips.

The sign-in process was simple, though it takes a few minutes if it’s your first time because you’ll need to register your kids and sign waivers—but it’s totally worth it.

What truly stood out to me was the customer service. The two staff members working that day were fantastic—kind, patient, and respectful (which is not always easy when you’re surrounded by excited, tired, or hungry kids!). They made great recommendations when I felt overwhelmed, which made my life as a mom so much easier.

I especially want to thank Rachel, who is a mom of four herself. She was so incredibly warm and understanding—when she saw me juggling a couple of hangry little ones, she not only helped with snacks and suggestions but even shared sweet stories about her own children. That personal connection meant so much to me.

This place is a wonderful option for families with infants through tweens—whether you’re looking to burn off some energy on a rainy day or just want a fun outing with friends.

Pro tip: have your kids wear socks with some traction to keep them from slipping during play.

We’ll definitely be back!

Review: I was surprisingly impressed by this place. It is very clean and well put together so I didn’t have to worry about anyone getting injured seriously.

The giant playset in the middle is a really good mix of being challenging, but not hard. There’s plenty of space to maneuver and adults didn’t have to go save kids from getting stuck every few minutes. There was just enough challenge to make it difficult, but not terrifying or dangerous. I did not have to spend my entire visit cringing and hovering around the kids.

You can purchase a reusable game card, which doesn’t list the prices online, but each of the credits are around $.20 each purchased in five dollar increments. They have these little motorcycles you can ride on that was a bit of a waste for us for a dollar, because it is a very, very short ride and every time you even look at the wall, the motorcycle would stop working. They did have crane machines, though for eight and 16 credits, and I did like that the 16 credit machine gives you 20 chances to win a prize. It did not feel like a waste when my little one was able to snag a stuffed animal for four dollars.

I also really liked that you get to play all day for the price, so we walked across the parking lot to IHOP for lunch and then we’re able to come back and pick right up with our playing. It is definitely a better bargain than some of the places we go to that charge per hour for jump time... on a hot summer day, $20 to play essentially all day in an air-conditioned building is a steal. We will definitely be back this summer.

Review: We love kids empire! A great spot for the kids to get some energy out and safer than a trampoline park. Admission is a little to high for an everyday thing but punch cards make it more affordable. Snacks and socks are affordable too. They have wifi and tables so I can easily watch the kids while I get some work done but parents can play too if you want.

Review: I had such a wonderful time at Kids Empire with my daughter! She had so much fun, and it was great to see so many families enjoying themselves. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful, making the whole experience even better.

The space was well-maintained and felt very safe for both toddlers and older kids. It wasn’t overly crowded, but even if it had been, the setup allows for plenty of movement and activities. One of the best parts was seeing adults joining in on the fun it’s definitely a place where parents and kids can have fun together and make great memories.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, active day out with their little ones!

Review: I love that it’s affordable, but you are definitely paying the right price for the place. I was hoping to like this place, but unfortunately, it was very unkept. The establishment really needs to work on the cleanliness (wiping down every hour, the smell, the look of the equipment - some equipment was held together by duct tape, etc). It is a kids play space, which breeds germs and I didn’t feel comfortable letting my little stay too long due to it. Hoping that can change so that we can go back.

Review: Posting this here since I can’t seem to contact them via email or phone.

Hello. This is Skyia, Aryia’s mom who had a party with you guys this past Saturday. Please confirm you have received my email and if not I’ll have it attached below.

Hello,

I am reaching out regarding a party I had with you guys today from 4:30-6:30 for Aryia Johnson.

I am very displeased with how the party turned out, how unorganized everything was, and at how there were so many safety hazards that were not listed on your website nor in the photos you have on your website.

I arrive to this party with the intention that I didn’t have access to my party room until after 1 hour of play. When I got there I was told I had access. The pizza was placed in my room around 4:40pm. My party started at 4:30. When it was time for the kids to eat, I have 3 boxes of cold pizza, while 2 other boxes were in the warmer. Arriving it was VERY hot in the play area and in the party room. As I was going through the jungle gym I saw and took photos of a ripped netting with lots of totes, back drops, and random things that is under the slide. Kids should NOT have access to that. If I  wouldn’t have gone with my child I wouldn’t have known that was there. There were MULTIPLE things in the play area that did not work which means we were not able to use which I also have photos of. ALL  of the swings in the play area are being secured by TAPE and hanging by a thread which I also have photos of. And MANY MORE safety hazards for kids.

The ENTIRE play area felt like 82 degrees as well as my room. When going to eat in the room, I was able to get to my COLD pizzas . No party host , no one called my party to the room, no one checked on the party. Then, to have 20-30kids running around playing and then come to eat and drink, they have HOT caprisuns and COLD pizza. This was RIDICULOUS.

I am requesting a refund of my party. This was absolutely absurd. I have photos as well as 30 adults in my party and 4 adults that were in the play area, who’s contact information I have. Please advise on
This ASAP. I am willing to take further legal action if necessary.

Thanks.
Skyia Cooley

Review: Celebrated my daughter’s first birthday party here today. The decor set up was amazing. But unfortunately there was no “host” to assist with the party as stated in the package description. Juice boxes were not sat out I found them under the table, the pizza was cold by time it was time to eat. The front door didn’t work half the time so everyone had to use the side door in the party room which was right by the cake table. Let’s not forget it was hot as hell in the entire facility. 10/10 would not recommend for a party.

No assistant where the kids are playing for safety incase there is an emergency. The party was to end at 8pm 15mins in the middle when children are still playing  the manager turn off the lights when the kids are still in there and some parents trying to dress up there children to leave. I think a lot of safety issues are involved here.I think the appropriate authorities should visit this place. It is not safe at all. I will not recommend any person even my dog to go there. The rush you and don't give you enough time to have fun.

Review: Always have a good time here. It’s perfect for kids that aren’t ready for Hyper Kids and Sky Zone. Those places are better for kids 4 and older. It’s less money too. We had our 1 yr olds birthday here and we all loved it. We had the largest room. The rides and things they have for kids are appropriate for smaller children(but larger kids can have fun too). The spinning dolphins had the kids going crazy 😂. Birthday package was 🔥🔥

Hack for people wanting to make sure you have a good time… set your birthday party early. Be the first or second party in the building. That’ll make sure your run into less issues and people in the main room. It’s like a clothing store. It gets messier as the day goes. I’m a real person lol. Some people might have unrealistic expectations for this place. This place is Ross, not TJ Maxx or Homegoods.

They had a distasteful disposition. The shoe racks were broken and fallen apart. There were wall attacks left around for children to pick up and put in their mouth. They had tape holding rides together. They also had no tissue in the bathroom. There was poop on the toilet seats. The bathroom was disgusting when it was brought to their attention they were rude and unpleasant. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It is dangerous and unsafe.

Review: To Whom It May Concern:

I am sending this email in regards to a party I had there for my son just about a month ago. I should've known from the response prior to the party; this place was going to be a problem. The employees were rude and not helpful. We felt after paying, we were on our own. There was no party host. We had to continue to ask for things we needed that were supposed to be included in our package. When some of our guests arrived, they were told they could not get in because we had reached our limit which was totally not true. We were told we could have 30 guests we could invite. We never came close to that. The facility had another party going on at the same time or around the same time and your staff were mixing the guests up and giving the other party our wristbands. After realizing what was going on, we brought the mistake to the employee's attention who then stated she would give us a few additional wristbands as if she was doing us a favor.

In addition, there was hardly anyone at the front desk to assist guests where they should go or provide the wristbands needed. Many of my guests told us they walked right in and walked around until they found myself or my son's father. I also had another one of our guests who was stopped midway coming into the party room who was told she had to go back to the front and pay and several other guests who were denied entry until I was called to the front to see what was really going on. Who does that? The party was paid for by myself and my son's father. If there was anything additional to pay, that was the facility's duty to speak to him or myself, NOT OUR GUESTS.

To add to all this madness, the pizza was cold. I was told in advance I could purchase drinks for $1 to add to my order when I arrived. When my son's father went to the front to purchase the drinks, he was then told a different amount. We were totally disgusted with this place. My son had been there before in the past for a birthday party and this place was NOTHING as such. Not sure if this place is under new management or not, but I would not recommend this place to ANYONE and my son will NEVER be back. You all need to learn how to talk to people, learn how to run a business with more than two staff members with a number of parties going on at one time, know what you're talking about when you quote prices and most of all CLEAN THE RESTROOMS that WERE working and the equipment these kids are using. We had a number of complaints about how dirty and trifling the bathrooms were and how most of the stalls were not working. I was absolutely EMBARRASSED that I had even chosen a place like this to have my son's party. This was the absolute first time I have EVER had a party at a facility and ran into this many issues. I would hate to take this any further and report this place. DO BETTER! People are paying their hard earned money to have a nice time. I'm not looking for a response, but wanted to let you know all the drama myself and guests had to go through for something so simple.

Review: We had our daughters first birthday here over the weekend and I was highly disappointed. This establishment is not as advertised. The staff member at the front desk was rude and barely assisted with our party. She became visibility upset and stopped communicating with me and my guest when I expressed my concerns about the facility. The entry area is completely out of order and the shoe racks are mostly broken into pieces. The bathrooms are filthy, no soap or toilet tissue. The party room was dirty and smelly. It also had pin tacks all around the room which is an obvious safety hazard for kids. The play area is also visible dirty and you can tell it is not cleaned regularly. A lot of the equipment is patched up with tape. I’m sure this place is violating several health and safety standards.

Review: I just moved to the Melford community and was so excited to take my kids. First I drove and came right when the lady was about to leave for her lunch break which was at 2:30. She mentioned, “We will open back in an hour at 3:30pm”. So I drove home and the second time around walked with my kids since I live right around the corner. When I got there we waited outside for 20 mins and she still never showed back. The place was completely dark! I called at 4pm to see if she ever returned back…and still no answer!

Place is not reliable and sounds unprofessional from all the comments I am reading. There is a sign outside the building stating “Help needed”. This place will be out of business in no time!!

I’ll stick to Hyper Kidz! Y’all need to do better.

Nothing was clean, they have used the same balloons from others party that was halfway deflated, they told use that candy boxes will be there and the day of she said that they do not provide the candy boxes but when we arrived in the room there was empty boxes like the ones seen on the website in the corner of our party room. We couldn’t even have candy bags just candy and that also made us late for our party time that she did not give back to use. The kids barely even played because we had to enter into the party room before our time was up.

Review: Do not take your children here. Literally paid the THIRTY dollars to see what it was about when I already knew…When we walked in we waited in this area for 5 mins with no one there to say hold on or anything! Then when one lady came out she asked how did we hear about them and proceeded to “ring me up” she didn’t ask my kids ages or anything. The place smelt like it clean but it was definitely a front, must’ve been some plug ins because inside LAWD!! The plastic on everything had a grey-ish film on it (dirty) there was rips and tears everywhere. We can see the “storage” through the obstacle and it was easily accessible to the children and ourselves..There was even a child just sitting at the top of a obstacle just spitting and smearing it ALL over the mat she was sitting on. Nothing was turned in and it was cold inside.It was just the bottom of the toldom pole if there was one, right beneath it. I recommend Hyperkids always clean presten and no issues

Review: If you’re here reading reviews for consideration of if this is the right venue for your child’s party, Id love to share my personal opinion. I’ve both attended a party here and hosted a private party here Nov 2024. I too read through all these reviews before making the decision to make kidzden the place for my 5 yo bday party. The venue offers a lot of fun for kids of varying ages and it’s indoors which is a huge plus. If you have the ability to do so, a private party is 100% the way to go and eliminates a lot of areas of disappointment you see in the lower star reviews. I didn’t have to deal with a crowd of strangers/multiple parties at a time, I could use the largest party room at the venue, I didn’t have to limit my guest list, the place was clean without the leftover trash or recreational smells of other guests before us, the venue staff was attentive and helpful with both the planning beforehand (answering calls and emails promptly) and during the party. Our guests from the ages of 1-9 had the time of their lives. The adults had a great few hours hands off; letting the kids have at it. The waiver, rules and inclusion details are all transparent on the website. There were no surprises when it came time to pay my invoice, when guests were asked about the waiver or when reminded to take off shoes because as the host I made sure to over communicate that prior to the date of the party.  If private party isn’t in your budget it can still be a great fun place the kids, most importantly, will love. As with anything that has multiple bookings, there’ll be a room turnaround time, juggling of parties and various venue upkeep priorities, as well as many guests outside of your party. These are standard considerations anywhere you may publicly rent party space. I can see the justification for both the good and bad reviews. I don’t take away from anyone’s experience being met with rudeness or attitude, however that was just so far from our experience from start to finish. Don’t count them out.

Review: Any good review about this place has to be fake. This place is disgusting. The first room you walk in to take off your shoes and pay etc stinks and is filthy! Smells like weed, and feet. The play equipment and floors inside are DISGUSTING. The party rooms are tiny and not worth it for the price you pay. You have to pay extra to bring more food for your party? How much sense does that even make lol. What is it costing the establishment for ME to purchase outside food. So many ridiculous rules and clearly geared towards just taking your money rather than having customer satisfaction. There is so much competition in our area, take your child elsewhere.

Review: The only reason I’m giving 2 stars is because the kids in my party had a great time. I would not recommend this place for parties…everything seemed unorganized and the rules were so vaguely listed on the website that it made things hard to understand what the true intentions were. I had no idea I couldn’t even enter the room to see the setup prior to my party coming in. You can’t order extra food without telling them days in advance. It’s room temp capri suns and cold dominoes pizza. The room was literally  a closet that was listed to be able to hold 20 people (10 kids/10 adults). No outside food allowed except the cake…ridiculous. Overall the venue is great for kids but sucks for parties. Since I didn’t have the best experience I would never return or recommend this place to anyone.

Review: The Owner or Manager whomever that older lady is, was extremely rude !! During my entrance to my nephews party, there were no associates in the front to welcome me so I went to look for someone; before even saying hello she tells me “You need to take your shoes off”. Well ma’am, I’m looking for help to find out where to go. I didn’t have a child with me & I wouldn’t be staying long… yet she still insisted I needed to fill out a waiver. Which isn’t the problem, it’s not what you say, it’s how you say it. She needs to to work on her customer service.

Review: I’ve gone to this establishment on two separate occasions. The first time I took my 2 year old I was disappointed in the fact that some of the play spaces were damaged and appeared to be holding on by duck tape. I was also disappointed at the fact that the ball pits were not full which was insane because how can you have a ball pit with like 5 balls. The second time which is super recent to this review, I shared the same concerns on top of feeling like this establishment does not value cleanliness. The floors are dirty and even some of the play spaces. Typically when you got to these places like hyper kids, you have employees walk around constantly organizing and freshening up as needed. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT and it is starting to show. Just take a look at the floors and the play spaces. I do like how they added the trampolines which is the only reason I’m giving two stars. To the kidzden owners/staff, please clean and do your best to keep our babies safe by eliminating germs and creating a fun safe space.

Review: Nice for small kids . Too small for 10 years old .  I paid for my 2 kids 31 $ , for playing one hour only. The time on the door said closing at 8:30pm on Saturday but we are kicked out , at 7pm , the staff said she had an emergency.  They stop the music than  turn out the light , than told us they are closing !!!!!!!    It was a rude way !!!  The front  desk staff said I could come the next day for free , but I only was at this place to spend time with my kids while my husband finish a meeting nearby (his meeting finish at 8pm ) so I decide to let the kids play at this place , if they said from the beginning they close at 7 pm I will be with my kids in other place .

Review: This place has potential. I went on a Friday at noon so my child had the whole place to himself. The set up is nice, but as we moved throughout out the place I noticed how dirty their floors were and how trash like bag of chips was left around. It was also hot! Not sure if their AC was not functioning well but that was one of the reasons we ended up leaving. I understand most kids places end up getting dirty quick but they should have staff checking the place out every hour. Hopefully they will take this review into consideration and take care of this place more.

Didn’t have to bring any decorations really, they decorated and it looked so beautiful! For the price, it was definitely worth it! We were given an amazing experience, my daughter and family enjoyed theirselves both little kids and adults! Everything went smoothly, everyone came in and were given wristbands for the party. Our pizza’s arrived at a decent time and we overall were able to enjoy our time in the room!! Definitely recommend this establishment and would go back again for another birthday party!

My issue is there’s nobody in the front. I just wanted an ICEE for my kids & when I went to the lady, she said they were cleaning & can’t go to the front. I didn’t like that response so my family & I just left. They really need more employees. I will not be coming here again. I should’ve went to Totsville. It’s a much organized & overall better place.

Review: We’ve been here several times, and it seems to only get worse with each visit. They added in two trampolines from the last time we had been, but there was at least 5 broken pieces of equipment still out on the floor that looked run down and dangerous. Additionally there is absolutely no effort going into disinfecting anything there. Visible dirt on every surface. I’ve been to  a handful of these play places and you can certainly tell a difference when sanitizing and disinfecting is a priority for them. I’m not shocked that my son started showing flu like symptoms just days after visiting here last. We suspected he had caught hand foot and mouth from here a while back, and after this visit resulting in the flu we will most definitely not be back.

Review: My niece had her birthday party here on May 5th. From the mgr to her staff, which I think🤔might be her daughter. They have no customer service skills whatsoever😕The mgr was not at all pleasant when she was speaking with us which made me want to turn up my volume a bit but I was able to compose myself and not be disrespectful like she was talking. The young lady at the desk was also rude like the mgr and acted as though she really didn't want to be at work. The room was a complete failure. They had baby chairs in the room which was inappropriate to me for that age group. You have to squeeze yourself by the desk to get into the party room and then they walk other guests through your party to get to another room🤦🏽‍♀️The room was available for us until 3pm, but the manager comes in early pushing us out telling us to get our gifts out. They were taking off the tablecloths  and moving us out to prepare for the next party instead of allowing us to stay for the time that was paid for. The cleaning from what I witnessed was very minimal, they didn't appear to wipe down anything or spray anything in the process of preparing for the next party. They need to allow themselves a grace period of 15-30mins for clean up and set up instead of rushing people who have paid for a certain amount of time. Take my word and don't waste your money with these rude and inconsiderate people. I have actually witnessed small parties at Chick-fil-A. The families bring their tablecloths, balloons and purchase meals for the kids and they seem to have a fantastic time. Money spends anywhere, so please don't patronize them.

Review: This establishment is very unorganized I've attended two parties here and both times there were only two staff members available for front desk, cleaning, setting up parties etc, which is why they aren't on schedule and you have to wait an hour before going into your party room.  When you order additional pizza online through their site they still don't have them for your party but you are not allowed to bring your own food.  The bathrooms were smelly and unkept.  Ive attended parties at other indoor playgrounds like this and this is by far the worst.  They only accept cash because people stop payments on their credit cards because of the poor service.

This is not fair and it's not online stating these conditions. People drive to far for stuff like this. Another person was there and invited other people. And had to tell ppl this and had already paid. So I didn't get a chance to see what it looks like. Grandkids was sad and crying 😭

Review: My experience on 05/04/24(Saturday afternoon around 430pm:

1. The waiting area is small, also the shoe storages are broken with alot of exposed nails which is hazardous.

2. The play area: overcrowded with stuff, not enough space to move around especially when overcrowded with adults and kids running around. One yellow object seemed to be broken and was just laying on the floor. The metal piece could easily harm a child(should be removed).

3. Crowd control: There should be a capacity limitation that includes adults especially when hosting multiple large parties.

4. Staff: No one confirmed if we signed a waiver when we paid. Staff seemed uninterested in walking the floor and ensure proper use of equipment (as kids were climbing on top of the small kids area roof and jumping off onto the the floor and the side tables that surround the play area).

Presently this is not an indoor playground that we would be interested in returning too.

Review: Kids loved this spot. They have memberships, which saves a lot of money and totally worth it. But the front desk staff are never out front. Had to call the establishment to get someone to come check us in. Customer service is not the best. It depends on the day and the time of day. You never know what you will get. Smh. Adults have to take their shoes off, so bring socks. The little bumper cars are not ever charged and don't hold charge or are broken but the kids love them so I hope they fix it. After my membership is over, I won't be coming back. There's plenty of other places with better customer service..

Review: PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BOOK!!! This place is not a place to book your party. I had my party here for my son and it was the worst.The staff was very unorganized and very rushed when it came to party time. The time frame you book online is not the time frame you get. The manager kept coming in the party room during the party telling me what I could and couldn't do and being rude to my guest. They advertise juice and water bottles but they only provided one caprisun per child  and no water.The pizza arrived on time but it was warm and I was missing two pizzas which I requested in my contract. My guest felt very rushed at the arrival to the party. We had no beverages for the adults  unless you pay for it at the front desk.  As soon as we sung happy birthday the manager told me we had to exit out the party room. My guess where not able to eat cupcakes. I had to wrap the cupcakes up and pass them out in the parking lot.I would not suggest having a party here for your children. This place need new management ASAP or close down.

I decided to have my daughter's 5th birthday there.  It could not have been better.  The room was decorated based on my daughter's preferences.  They handled everything outside of the food.  It allowed me to be more present and available for my kids and guests.  Highly recommended for a day of indoor play or birthday party!

Review: This indoor playground is an absolute gem for families! The cleanliness here is unmatched: from the play equipment to the bathrooms, everything is spotless. The staff is constantly on the floor sanitizing, tidying, and making sure the space stays safe and welcoming. They also enforce the right rules, which helps create a fun yet orderly environment that parents can truly appreciate.

We come here regularly when it’s too hot, too cold, or raining, and it’s always a lifesaver. We also recently celebrated our child’s birthday here, and it was amazing and truly memorable.  The party was well-organized, the kids had a blast, and the staff went above and beyond to make it special.

It’s not the cheapest place, but it’s absolutely worth every penny for the peace of mind, quality experience, and happy kids. Plus, we’re always happy to support a local business that does it right.  Highly recommend!

Review: Recess Play Center is an amazing indoor playground for children. Walk ins only. Booking a party on the other hand is kinda not where I would go. The reason I say this is because the standard package we book states each additional adult is $5 more. I had over 10 adults. Upon arrival at Recess, ask the attendee at the front desk. I am going to have over 10 possible kids and 10 adults as included with my set package. I specifically ask can teenage kids who are not gonna play, who are just observers. Can they be charged as an adult? I was told by the wife owner and other associate that will be fine as long as they are 15 & over. Some how three teenagers were given a payed wristband before the rest of the younger kids came. so upon the younger kids that came later, I was told to pay the full $25 fee when I specifically request to give the payed bands to the younger kids and add the additional $5 observer fee to my remaining balance. We did come up with a resolution after 15 mins of back and forth 😒Another issue I had was the size of the room. I understand that I booked that particular size but if you see that my party has grown, I would expect that they will have moved to another room as we were the only party there on Thursday evening. Most of my guests couldn't even sit down to eat. Also, didn't like we have to wait until the second hour to go in the party room that is explained on the website, but that should be changed.

unfortunately they do not provide any type of food for you so come with your own food or you could pay for some snacks at the concession stand, only snacks like ice cream soda chips Do not except for some chicken, pizza, or any other hot food. LOL. Please note regardless if you not playing or just have to use the restroom. To go to the back you have to remove your shoes. Another thing is I was charger a gratuity fee (that felt mandatory) when it is not stated on the site or during the booking. SMH

Thats why I give it a four star. It was amazing other than the issue we had earlier. I am thankful for the amazing experience the children had and I definitely will take my kids back again, but only as a walk-in, I cannot do a party. LOL

On a good note, the entire playground was clean. It was sanitized. It was much fun. I had fun as a big kid at heart myself.

Review: I really appreciate the cleanliness of this place however do not expect any help with set up for a party which you would expect for the price you pay. I did have a couple adult guests that the provided socks literally could not fit on their feet (size 14 and size 16 shoes) and they only wanted to go to the party room to see the birthday kid but they were not allowed to participate in the children's party but I still ended up paying for them and every employee was quite rude about it. I love the space but customer service needs some work. Go to play not to party.

Review: We recently had our son's 5th birthday party at Recess and I can't recommend it highly enough.  We worked with Drew for planning the party and he was amazing.  He answered all of our questions and made sure to get all of the decorations and place settings matching the theme our son had picked.  On the day of the party, the staff took care of everything from setting up the room to helping us clean up after the party was over.  All of the kids had an amazing time , especially the birthday boy.  Other parents mentioned how clean and well organized the place was.  Thank you Drew and your entire team for making our son's birthday a huge success!

Review: Will never book as a party or as a customer. The place is too small for all the money they want. It’s not worth it at all. The owner drew was disrespectful an aggressive. We asked to rent another room cause we was short on time an then he put us out cause he smelled alcohol. He just wanted a reason to put us out. Nobody in my family drinks at all. I don’t recommend the place. Also you can not get past the gate if you don’t put their socks on that they provide which is crazy. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

Review: Dear Recess Play Center Management,

I recently visited your facility in Silver Spring, MD, and unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. While I appreciate the clean and spacious environment, I found the pricing to be unreasonably high compared to similar play centers in the area. Given the cost, I expected a better overall experience.

Additionally, I was surprised to find that no food options were available on-site. Many play centers offer snacks, drinks, or at least a designated area for families to eat, making visits more convenient for parents and children alike. The lack of food services significantly impacted our visit, as we had to leave earlier than planned to find a suitable dining option elsewhere.

I wanted to bring these concerns to your attention in hopes that you might reconsider your pricing structure and improve amenities to better serve families. I would appreciate a response regarding any steps you plan to take to address these issue. I will never go here again.

So many different areas to choose from he just kept switching to a “New” favorite.  We will be back!!!

Review: Starting out, everything was fine. Checked in , signed the waiver, helped my child with her socks and waited for my friend to arrive .. upon their arrival we preceded to head to the play area when a young African American boy asked me “ Did I check in, where is your wrist band!?” Me “ Yes. You were standing next to the young lady who checked me in.” And proceeded to show him my wrist band. His response “Oh yes.. I forgot” … that was less than 5 minutes ago with low traffic coming in but okay … then proceeded on with play time. A guy name Dru decided it was best to threaten kicking us out for not wearing their socks. Keep in mind we are sitting the ENTIRE TIME.. but it’s a mandatory to have the socks. Whether you siting , squatting , cartwheeling, a paramedic, NO SOCK NO ENTRY.!… So we went to put the socks on… fine whatever right … SAME GUY DRU … proceed to saying .. “ It’s up to yall , you can stay or leave “ .. we like you clearly see us putting on the socks… At this point no ..It’s way to many if these placesin the area to deal with this side ways behavior…I’ll be posting this on my tik tok later.

Review: It is a fun place to play. Kids love it. But as parent, I have some concerns. First, some of the slides and área of play are not patted well. So it makes it dangerous for concussion. Also, even though the rule is not to eat or drink in the playground, there is not enough personal to reinforce it. Lastly, it will be nice if the playground games are maintained, cus some of the game are not working properly. Just a little upkeep will make this place our favorite one.

Review: Had my 3 year olds birthday party here and it was perfect! Jenn and Drew (the owners) were so amazing and helpful and FLEXIBLE with us as we navigated this day.
The Room: the covered tables were set up with cups, plates, and napkins. They even INCLUDED cool spidey Balloon decorations to go with our theme. We got to take the balloons home after! The room is equipped with Bluetooth so we could play music. We were allowed to bring food, drinks, and cake and Recess supplied some chips and drinks as well. Jenn came in during the party to help hand out pizza and just in general be helpful.
The playspace:
Omg so we've LOVED the playspace since day one. We are frequent fliers haha. There is so much to do for the kids from bikes, to wall climbing, to exploring the playspace. There's a ball pit (the best part about that for this germ fearing nanny is that they have a ball cleaner! The balls get cleaned on a weekly basis i think). There are 6 different areas (7 if you include the wall with the...idk what to even call that. Remember that toy ((millennials I'm talking to you!)) That you put your hand on and it made the imprint and we would of course put our face in it? Yea they have a huge body size one of those!!). They have an area for your little crawlers with plenty for them to climb and explore. The playspace is big enough for me to get in and climb with my 3 year old. There are 3 slides and a section with a ""ball volcano!) They also have ball launchers in the upper area. It's a plenty big space for kids to run around. Oh they also have a cool light color wall! And you can buy snacks from honest juice to some coke products to teddy grams.

I can keep singing this places praises all day! You definitely want to go here for a playdate or a birthday party!! We will.be back friday!

Review: My 16 month old daughter and I checked it out for the first time on a very cold Tuesday morning after hearing several families rave about it. We loved it! It was quiet when we arrived around 10am, just a couple other kiddos and their adults, and the gal working at the front desk was one of the owners. She was welcoming and gave us a great rundown of how everything worked. The space was clean, inviting, and oh so fun. I was impressed by the wide variety of things for my enthusiastic and toddling daughter to do - from STEM activities with balls to slides to a giant Light Bright.
It felt safe and secure to leave our coats and shoes in the cubby. The attention to detail was impressive - like guest Crocs by the bathrooms so the gym socks stay clean, the hand sanitizer stations sprinkled throughout the building, clear signs where direction was needed.... it added up to be a very fun, engaging, positive morning.
We are looking forward to going back again!

Review: Have your child’s birthday party here!  It was AMAZING.  We had my son’s fourth birthday here today and the execution was flawless.  I dropped off party supplies 15 minutes before our start time and wasn’t expecting the staff to set everything up so wonderfully.  We walked in the party room when it was our time and it looked spectacular, everything was set up and ready to go!  Drew was wonderful to work with and made the whole experience so easy.  He handled everything from start to finish and went above and beyond to ensure our friends and family had a wonderful day.  This was by far the easiest, nicest party.  We’ve been to other play places that have made parents rush in, set up/decorate in 10 minutes and then clean up and rush out.  Recess does the exact opposite — they set up and clean up.  All you have to do is show up and bring any extras you want to have, they do the rest.  The entire staff was wonderful and so accommodating.  This place is clean, the staff is knowledgeable, friendly and KIND.  I cannot recommend them enough.  All our friends and family were also so impressed.  We’ll be back for birthday number five and to play on a regular basis.

Review: I love this place, but not to throw a birthday party and I don’t recommend you do so if you’re thinking a party over 20 guest. The only thing I can say is 100/10 is that your guest are allowed to play as long as they want to but when I was taking my things to the back for the party host I heard one of them say “oh no she can’t keep bringing things in they won’t fit” just because they didn’t want to continue pushing carts but they demand you tip 10% I get they don’t remain in the room for privacy but you don’t get 1 designated host and they popped up maybe 5 times on me. I asked for napkins and only got 1 tiny pack. I had to keep running around to find a host, front desk had 1 Spanish speaker who was refusing to speak to my guest in Spanish which luckily I stood at the front and helped most of my guest. Also they didn’t help me set up anything besides push like 2 stands in, im grateful I had friends and family who helped. I will definitely be returning as a customer, but definitely not for parties. The employees are young and I understand but lacking respect has nothing to do with their age.

Review: Couple things you should know before your visit. Adults are charged $5 for entry and $5 for socks regardless if you are participating in play. You must wear the socks that they sell to enter the facility.

They have huge signs that display their unhealthy snacks so your kid will be tempted by this.

Small children can run underneath the locked entry gate making it difficult for parents to retrieve them. There is a separate gate for exiting.

Overall my son had a ok time here but for the price I would do Hyperkidz next time.

Review: The kids and I LOVE Hyper Kidz especially because it’s adult friendly in size so that you can monitor your child . The pricing is GREAT. $34 for me and my two kids to play as long as we want 🤌🏽. It’s huge with SO MUCH TO DO for all ages . …

Review: My grandkids love this place.  It’s nice to go during the first part of the day - not as many kids.  I have a nice set up with the kids.  I tag them with a Tile, and when I beep it, they have to come to where I’ve set up to check in.  And of course if there is an issue, they can push the button and I will find them.  Yes, I was a helicopter parent, and I’ve promoted to helicopter grandparent 🤣

Review: Loved this place! Was visiting family and looking for something for my tots to do indoors away from the 90 degree heat. Hyper Kidz was the perfect spot to take them with age appropriate play areas, lots of friendly staff protecting the 2 and under area from big kids. The whole place, including the bathrooms, were super clean. Also loved that I paid in the morning and was able to come back after lunch and nap time as long as we kept our bracelets on! $23 total for a full day of tot entertain!

Review: Took my kiddos on the Wednesday cheaper day 11.99 vs. regular price of 15.99 or so. They have a 10% military discount and all the staff was friendly. We were there when it opened and it got a bit crowded by the time we left at noon, but it was fun, safe, and a great way to beat the heat 🥵
AC was nice and cool and they let you bring in your kid's snacks and food which was really nice. They even have little counter seating so you can still watch the kids play and work on a laptop or eat a meal. We will definitely be back.

One isn’t interchangeable with the other, but one definitely enhances the other if that makes sense. The place was clean; ESPECIALLY THE BATHROOMS🤯😅🎯. But most importantly it is a fun and SAFE environment. As a matter of fact I’m writing this as I’m watching my 2 daughters navigate the rope bridge ; complete with imaginary lava!😅 And I’m able to comfortably supervise from the sidelines and still take 3-5 minutes to write this review.

It is very clean, feels super safe and secure. Gets crowded in the weekends but is very manageable in weekdays, even in the evening. My almost 2 year old likes it too and they have a nice separate area for babies, but he likes to wander to the big kid area so it’s a lot more chasing with him. Highly recommend!

Review: So- just like every other kid place this business is crazy over stimulating BUT the kids love it and I highly recommend it over Chuckie Cheese or Sky zone. It’s clean, enclosed, parents and kids wear matching wrist bands, and the music isn’t blasting amassing to the general cacophony of kids having fun. It won’t break the bank and your kids can play all day for a flat fee. All in all, much better than typical indoor playgrounds.

Review: Yesterday afternoon my husband took my kids to this location and my son got hit in the face because another child didn’t want to play with him. The parents stepped out of the building leaving him in there unattended. While the assistant manager offered to file an incident report that wouldn’t rectify the situation took place. The only solution was if my son got hit again or the boy hit someone again he would be asked to leave. This picture is my sons face today and he’s emotional go out no because he got hit in the face. I feel like this is unacceptable and the child should be removed immediately after assaulting another child and leaving marks on their face.

Review: This is the only indoor playground we take our 3 year old too. He absolutely loves it. We've been to other indoor playgrounds and while they're all welcomed parents to play on the equipment with their kids, this is the only one that actually seems to have been built to accommodate parents. It's much easier and more comfortable for adults to navigate. There are plenty of seats for parents as well including couches and snacks that can be purchased.

Review: UPDATE:
Owner called and was apologetic with what happened during our last visit. Our lady few visits have been so great and the staff have been so helpful and great.  I believe there was one night where the staff was playing with my son when there were no other kids to play with.  I am grateful they showed him a great time.  My kids been wanting to go back often so I renewed my membership. This place is clean and very well maintained. I been to a lot of these indoor places across the country and I will say this is the most comfortable and versatile indoor playground.  👌 ❤️

This place is a great indoor place for my 5 and 7 year old,  but one of the younger girls (blonde) in the front desk need to have an attitude adjustment. I have a membership there and I been coming here for almost a year. I might plan a party here in a few months,  but if staff is not up to par with customer service I might have to find other options.

Review: We came here, on Saturday evening. And had a few problems.
The first one we were charged for an infant when we had two other children playing (the website says free with paid siblings.
The second one, I child got a little tikes car up in the climbing structure and pushed it down the slide almost hitting my child. My child then tried to get in it and was pulled out violently by the other kid. The staff did not notice until the seen me trying to stop the situation.
I watched them “sanitize” and they just spray lysol up in the air not really focusing on anything or watching to make sure children aren’t in the way.
I watched both staff members go to the restroom at the same time leaving the front desk unattended and people waiting to get in for 5-7 mins

To many parents sitting on the couch on their phones not paying attention to their children

This could be an amazing place just needs a bit of work, and maybe better employee training

Review: The last two times I had brought my grandaughter here it was 8.00 when she was 1 year old and then they charged me 11.00 two months ago so we came back today I brought 11.00 of cash only . They told me 13.00! I said last time it was 11.00 they just stood there and stared at me! Two young girls. I said well I guess I will have to leave then because all  I have is 11.00 they said sorry. I decided to call my husband to come back all the way here to bring me 3.00 . I told them he would be here soon and they made my 20 month old and I wait inside the gated area for 12 minutes geezers! Instead of letting us inside ! The girls were whispering back and forth.  I will never ever step foot back in this place again! They charge a clean up fee as well but the children's play area looked like tornado so they never cleaned it.

Daughter got sick the following day, so I don't know if the toys and surface areas were properly sanitized or not, but it was an overall nice experience. The staff were pleasant there so that helped.

Review: If i could give 0 stars I would. I went here for a birthday party and the two teenage girls in the front checking people in are rude, They need training in customer service. I also observed how they treated other party attendees and they were rude to them as well. I believe they said they would call the police on a lady and she was just standing there talking to other party goers. From my observation they seem to have a problem with people of color. This was my last time supporting this place I've been here before and everytime those two are there they give me a hard time. I will spend my hard earned money where my business is wanted. Besides the rude customer service the kids enjoy themselves.

Bring socks for everyone, even you mom and dad. No shoes allowed for anyone past the door and socks are required. You have to be shoeless and have socks even if you're just sitting and watching. Its a cute fun place for the littles.

Review: The owners are some fantastic folks who have skillfully woven together a very clean, extremely safe ""Fabulous Fantasy Fun  Land"" for all the little chillins. The staff is comprised of easy goin, kind hearted High school girls like 'Hannah', who attends the same church as my folks.  Every weekend has multiple B-day parties and many Saturdays they will close down a couple hours early for Private / Invitation only Birthday soirees.
This place is, hands down, my daughter's jam! She thinks she's VIP cuz her bff is a daughter of the owners. Lol.
Anyways....
Little Flyers understood the assignment and produced a magnificent gem full of Epic Experiences that harmoniously appeals to the racially diverse melting pot that makes up Midwest City.

Review: We were pleasantly surprised by this indoor playground. We visited DC during a heat wave and needed a safe and cool place for our toddler to play. We came here during a weekday and paid $15 for u limited play time + $5 for an extra adult. Our son has a great time and played for hours. He’s 2.5 and could do almost everything. The staff was polite and they did well to intervene if certain spaces were too crowded and/or in unsafe situations. The place is very clean and we saw multiple sanitizer stations throughout. We’d come back on a very hot or rainy day.

Review: Yesterday, March 15, 2025, I attended Magic Ground for the first time with my kids for a birthday party. I arrived early, and even though the party host hadn't arrived yet, the staff kindly allowed us to enter and let the kids start playing. Getting in was completely hassle-free.

Having been to many indoor play areas, I can confidently say that while Magic Ground is smaller than most, it is by far the best one I've experienced. The manager, Franklin, and his staff were beyond amazing—attentive, pleasant, and genuinely focused on making the experience enjoyable for everyone.

Unlike many other venues that rush parties and offer minimal assistance, Magic Ground provided exceptional service. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure everything ran smoothly. The kids had an absolute blast, and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a children's party.

Review: This place isn't bad. It was much smaller than we expected it to be. There are 2 slides, a small trampoline, and a bunch of climbing structures. There's a book corner with books and a whiteboard. But the markers were all dried up. There is a section for under 3. There is a ball pit at the base of a slide with some space behind it to play in. Also a little ball pit for under 3. There were several tables to eat on. There isn't much space for your things and shoes. It being DC, we did have to park in a garage and pay for that. On the wknd it's $14 for one hour or $19 unlimited. It is secure, gate by the exit, and staff at the front. And heaven forbid a kid takes a ball out of the pit for a second. There's someone constantly watching the kids and reminding them of the rules. I understand making sure rules are followed but it felt a bit overbearing.
I think what threw us off was the size. We're used to omnifun, hyperkidz, jolly yolly, etc. My 4yr old said she ""did everything"" rather quickly. I think it was because there wasn't as much diversity of things to do.

Review: As a concerned parent, I must express my disappointment with the recent visit to Magic Ground. Our experience was far from enjoyable due to several concerning factors that compromised the safety and cleanliness of the facility.First and foremost, the presence of mice within the playground is unacceptable and poses a serious health risk to the children playing there. Not only is it unsanitary, but it also creates an environment that is not conducive to a fun and carefree play experience. It's alarming that such a fundamental issue like pest control is being neglected.Additionally, the lack of enforcement regarding the ""socks at all times"" rule is concerning. This rule exists for a reason - to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of germs and bacteria. However, during our visit, it was evident that many children were running around barefoot, completely disregarding this rule. This negligence on the part of the staff is disappointing and reflects poorly on the overall management of the playground.Furthermore, I was deeply troubled by the staff's lack of attentiveness to children who were hurting others. It is imperative for playground staff to actively monitor the interactions between children and intervene when necessary to prevent any harm or conflicts from escalating. Unfortunately, this was not the case during our visit, and it resulted in several incidents where children were left vulnerable to injury.In conclusion, my experience at Magic Ground was marred by unsanitary conditions, lax enforcement of rules, and inadequate supervision.
As a parent, I cannot in good conscience recommend this playground to others until these issues are addressed and resolved.
Children's safety and well-being should always be the top priority, and it's disheartening to see these standards being overlooked.

Staff are nice, and there is an impressive variety of things to climb, slide, draw, and play with. Climbing wall, toddler areas, drawing station, and even some video games.

Minus one star because there is at most one working marker for the whiteboards, and half the Wii U stations were out of order. Also, if you are planning to rely on their food, you might want to call first to see if it is open. On Presidents’ Day no food or snacks were being served.

They made the experience very special for my son (who wanted a Super Mario/rainbow theme) and he's already eager for another party! Thank you Magic Ground and Franklin!!

Review: I am so happy that I found this affordable indoor place space for my kids. I appreciate how the staff frequently monitors the safety and cleanliness of the area very well. There is plentiful activities and space for the children to stay entertained, and I was happy that there was a sitting/eating area where the adults could be to still supervise their children while playing. Great indoor play space option.

The kids had a great time playing, and Magic Ground provided pizza, cookies and a beautiful cake, and decorated the space really nicely. The staff is very friendly and helpful too.

Review: Terrible place. If you have a toddler, don’t go there. Before I got inside I asked if they had area for toddlers and they said yes, for kids between 0-3yo. The only thing they didn’t tell me was nobody watch this area, so big kids were there all the time. Also there was a lady wearing shoes and other one barefoot, when there’s a big sign saying this was not allowed.
The other negative point is the outlet was not protected at the toddler’s area. When I complained about all these, the only thing the guy and girl at the front desk told was: sorry, we can’t do anything 🤷🏻‍♀️

When I got there for the party the business was closed due to COVID. However, not once was I notified and they also took my money knowing that they’re closed. I haven’t been able to get in contact with anyone to get a refund. I will never support this business again. Unprofessionalism at its best!

Everything was clean and I felt totally comfortable letting our toddler run around and play. What sets this place apart from others is that it’s mostly geared towards younger ages (I would say 6 and under). All around I highly recommend!

Review: Love love this place. My daughter just turned two and is obsessed with dinosaurs. I’m so glad we found a place that caters to Dino loving kiddos, or any kiddo. We were able to rent the entire place and the decor is absolutely beautiful, cute, posh, and kid friendly. It was just wonderful to have alerting taken care of for you. We purchased the package that included cupcakes and the Dino that comes out to dance. I was also impressed with how organized it was and there were different play areas each with its own play theme. My daughter loved the little kitchen area and some of our little guests enjoyed wearing the costumes that were set up in the back. Jill helped us coordinate our party and was just absolutely kind and walked me through everything. They did let us bring our own cake and food. Some of the parents went next door to get some coffee because with that many kids running around, you need to keep up. That in itself was convenient for the adults. The goody bags that were provided had some fun quality toys in there. We appreciated the nice personal touches like the slide show photos of our daughter and the little sign with her picture on it was so sweet. Dino Kidz really went that extra mile.This is the Allen location. I would’ve chosen the one in Carrollton, but most of our guests live closer to Allen. We can’t wait to visit the Carrollton location soon.

They even do a dance party every couple hours where they turn down the lights and play dance videos, then have a bubble party. The facilities are clean and the staff is kind, and there's soft padding over the flooring so it's a good place for babies and toddlers too. It's a great place to meet up with friends for play dates too!

Review: We have been coming here since they opened and have always loved it. Today we celebrated my daughter’s first birthday here and I literally can’t even put into words to explain my gratitude and happiness for this place. First of all let’s talk about cleanliness and space, this is hands the cleanest play place in all of DFW. Everything always looks so immaculate  every time we come in. You can tell they care a lot about the health of children with how clean they keep it. They’re always adding new things, the space is open, and there is so much to do for all ages, from a babies to 9 year olds. Second, price point, which for me is huge. So many play places now a days don’t have many budget friendly options. Dino kidz has that still while having the cutest special customizing that’s included in your package which just made our party feel so elevated! Like the slideshow of pictures of our daughter and the sign out front. Lastly, Jill and the girls are actual angels from heaven and decorated everything so beautifully. They were helpful, kind, informative, and loving to us and all of guests. Anyone who disagrees with that, must have a mental illness. I literally couldn't have gotten through the day without these ladies. Jill is also so good with the kids, she came and sat on the ground and played with my daughter and I for a minute, and my daughter tried to hold on to her which she doesn’t do to most people! They explain the rules about the keeping the door shut and yucky bins and that’s it! Normal rules about not carrying toys when climbing, which thank goodness for that right? We have some wild brothers and older kids in our party, no one broke the rules, no one got yelled at, kids were able to be kids! I love the music and activities they have planned and the schedule for their parties, it keeps the kids interested and no one is sitting around bored. The good-bye bubble party at the end is the best idea. The pictures I took don't even do it justice. I would have my kids party over and over again at Dino Kidz! We thank you guys for giving us the best party for our baby girl. We will never forget it. If you’re looking to plan a party here, I wouldn’t think twice! 10/10

The activities are very well-designed, and my 3 1/2 year old grandson loved it.
He was so happy to see all of the different stations - he played for 2 1/2 hours and was constantly learning and enjoying.
Also, I noticed the play areas are exceptionally clean and well-maintained.   Several moms had their infants crawling on the floor - it was that clean.
Thank you for a wonderful experience  - we will certainly be back!

Review: I’m sad to be leaving 2 stars but I feel like it’s needed for constructive criticism. We came here on a Friday, it’s Sunday and my kids are sick from visiting here. For all the reviews saying it’s clean here I am combating that with a no, it’s not. It was disappointing. There was a lot of hair in the ball pit. Our white socks turned brown on the bottom after 30 minutes. The place itself was cool, lots of things to do for the kiddos and the lady working the front desk was VERY kind! However the cleanliness of the play area is just not there and that’s extremely important.

When my oldest started climbing the walls today I decided to try out Dino Kidz and I’m so glad I did! It was perfect for her age (3) and for my youngest (1). It was clean, safe, and there were activities for a wide range of ages.
Once of my favorite parts was when they did a dance break and bubble time! My daughter loved it. We will be back!

Review: My husband and I took our kids today for the first time. This place was absolutely amazing! Very friendly staff, clean facility, and overall extremely accommodating to little toddlers. We had been having a hard time finding somewhere that our toddlers could safely play with freedom to run around with kids their age, while not being overcrowded. We have found our spot, and will definitely be returning for more visits. Also, there is a massage chair for parents to use while watching their kids play.
This was an easy 5 star rating for me!

This play place has the best of all worlds… play area with slides and climbing but small enough you can watch them up there and know they are safe. Many fun unique play areas and quite play also! They also have a dance party and kids get to dance along on the stage! Very clean and they were constantly cleaning and putting toys in the proper areas so the kids would have toys in each area. Highly recommend

The helper didn't serve the pizza to the kids. They don't even help cut and serve the cake. I would not recommend this place for the kids' birthday party.

Review: Good for toddlers. It looked kind of run down and some of the toys didn’t even work. What annoyed me the most was that they have a 15 minute dance party played on a big projector screen with baby shark and other songs. I brought my kid here to avoid screen time at home, not to have her see it on an even bigger screen. Also the music is blasting the entire time so it all just felt really overstimulating

Everything was meticulous and thoughtful from the slide show, to the personalized welcome sign in the front. The themed decor was adorable and the host , Jill, was spectacular about letting us know what to expect and how to time everything to maximize play time foe the kids.

I can't recommend this place enough!

Review: Honest Review….
There are newer & better buildings to throw a kid’s party. I was very hesitant when I came to visit the spot after booking online.
The CONS:
1. The themed decorations were nice but could have been a lot better.
2. The pizza was cold after sitting too long.
3. The staff was friendly but didn’t know much about what my party consists of. We had a themed character, a balloonist, & a face painter. The host was not aware until she looked it up.
4. They only clean 15 minutes before the next party
They leave previous party balloons out even when they don’t match current theme.
5. Need newer play equipment
6. Behind the counter is chaotic clutter
7. Vegetable & Fruit Platter should have been a better presentation. I can get better from Kroger.
8. Buy your own cupcakes, the ones provided were just ok.
9. For $1700, I expected a lot more from Dino Kidz not the 3rd party vendors.

The PROS:
1. You get the place just for your party
2. 3rd party vendors really know how to hype a party, the balloonist was exceptional. The face painter was also wonderful.
3. The staff was friendly & good at hosting
4. They set-up & clean up
5. The dance party was great
6. The slideshow was a very special touch

Overall, because of the balloonist & the themed character we were able to hype the party & make a really nice time. The kids of course loved it & that’s what mattered.

The location was easy to find, clean, the toys were a ton of fun. We had kids ages 1 year- 10 and they were all very entertained. Also, the bathrooms were very clean and the staff was incredibly kind and friendly

I told them that my daughter is girly but she loves dinosaurs and the employee said “girly dinosaurs, we can do that!” They put tutus on the dinosaur chairs (see picture attached). That was so cute and clever! Cannot say enough nice things about this place!

Review: I brought my little one here and he had a ball here. They played a little music which helped to stimulate him. They also had a bubble machine that my toddler immediately gravitated to. It was so heart warming to see all the kids bonding over the bubble machine. No technology and no TV it was just kids being kids. Our overall experience here was amazing. I would also like to mention Jill. She was fenomenal and helped me as soon as I arrived. I told her it was our first time here and she immediately helped me with getting familiar with the place. I have been to many play gyms and I must say this one is the best one and it was so worth the drive. Please give Jill a raise she is doing an amazing job here with the kiddos!

Worth every single penny and so much for the kids to get into. Playtime, dancing, signing, pizza, cupcakes more playtime and bubbles ending our event. They do everything for you, and accommodate anything you need. We upgraded our package several days before our son’s bday and had no issues. We will be back for playtime and will be recommending Dino Kidz to other parents looking to host bday parties.

From the big building foam blocks to the ball pit ,and the bubble party, there wasnt a moment my sweet girl wasn't smiling. I always worry  about there being too many people for my baby or an over whelming environment for her, but the fact that we had the entire place to ourselves put my mind at such ease. They do all the work like decorating and cleaning and everything in between. So I was over the moon to be able to actually be with my birthday girl and play and celebrate without any stress. They were so caring and informative, and always had a smile. If I could give them 10 stars I would. We will be coming back for my oldest daughters 7th birthday. She had so much fun and can't wait to be back! See you soon Dino Kidz!

Review: POOR CLEANLINESS. HEALTH RISK. This was our second time visiting Hyper Kidz and came from southern Maryland (1.5hrs) since southern Maryland doesn't offer much for things like this to do with kids. Yesterday we visited and made a day trip with our 3YO daughter. We always pack water from home, but our daughter was thirsty and the water fountains were right there. It wasn't until about 30 seconds of her drinking from the fountain that I noticed the collection of dark mold all around the spicket where the water passes through for consumption.  The other fountain next to it had pink mold around that one. It is evident they do not clean these at all or as frequently which is crazy considering the amount of children that passes through in there and use these. I mentioned this to the front desk and they offered a free water bottle and notified another employee. It looked like the employee they notified went into a closet and I assumed there were going to take care of that right away and clean it. Wrong- instead she came out and decided cleaning the front door glass was more important. I watched for a while and no-one came to clean fountains. Guess they're okay with children drinking from their molded fountains. Following this, my daughter began to complain of stomach pain and has been coughing and sneezing. Coincidence, maybe but she was symptom free before she arrived.  Bottom line- the place lacks cleanliness and I see there's been other complaints regarding cleanliness. I hope they take their cleaning practices more seriously in the future. Fun place, but they need to do better.

Review: Just visited  Kids Jungle Land in White Marsh, Maryland, and I can  say this place is a hidden gem for families with young kids! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm welcome and a vibrant, jungle-themed atmosphere that immediately caught my children’s attention.

The facility is super clean, well-organized, and packed with fun. The indoor play structures are impressive — colorful slides, climbing tunnels, obstacle courses, and even a separate toddler area, which I really appreciated. It’s the perfect mix of safe and adventurous.

What stood out the most to me was how engaged and energetic the staff were, Stacy and Ashley ! They  are such sweethearts!🌷they kept everything running smoothly, ensured safety rules were followed without being overbearing, and were always smiling and happy to help and very easy to talk to and very  welcoming ! This is definitely the place to bring your children. They will go home tired And out your hair!😂 Definitely worth the visit!

Review: My kids and I had a wonderful time! Absolutely no complaints on the facility or the staff; except who I’m assuming is the manager, old white lady with glasses. She was very rude to me and my family when we came in and spoke over me when checking in. She seems to make her employees do all the dirty work and not take initiative her self, if you are representing the company as the manager you should be nicer and take the initiative yourself instead of leaving it to your younger employees. I also saw her sitting down on her phone while the other employees were running around tending to other guests, which I believe is heavily unprofessional. The rest of the staff were very friendly and welcoming and would kindly inform parents and children of the rules, but every time she would come out she was rude with the children and some of the adults, I understand having policies and rules to follow but there is no need to be rude especially when talking to children. I also think if there is a problem to come to the parent if possible because most children can’t comprehend what they’re being told. Other than that, my experience was good and my family and I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend this place!! Just fix the management she is not a good face for your company.

Review: Wonderful Experience at Kidz Jungle Land – Thanks to Ms. Stacy!

We’ve been coming to Kidz Jungle Land at White Marsh almost every day, and I can’t say enough great things about Ms. Stacy, the manager. She has been absolutely amazing!

Ms. Stacy is extremely attentive to the safety of every child. She’s always alert, making sure no child is ever left unattended or near the exit unsupervised. Her dedication to keeping the play area clean and organized is impressive, even during busy weekends. It's clear she takes pride in ensuring the space is both fun and safe for all families.

She’s also very pleasant and interactive with the kids. My 4-year-old son absolutely adores her and is always excited to see her. She has a special way of making children feel welcome and cared for.

A few months ago, we hosted our son’s birthday party at Kidz Jungle Land. Ms. Stacy and Ash went above and beyond to help us decorate and manage the event. They made the whole experience smooth and stress-free for us. Hosting a party in a large, active space is no small task, but they handled everything like true professionals.

Running such a big facility smoothly—especially during weekends—isn’t easy, but Ms. Stacy and her team consistently do an outstanding job. They not only maintain the space beautifully but also treat every guest with kindness, professionalism, and a strong focus on safety.

Big thanks to Ms. Stacy and everyone at Kidz Jungle Land! We truly appreciate all you do.

The employees are young but seem even tempered around child chaos and pleasant to guests. The manager, Stacy, is one of the kindest people I’ve met in awhile. She’s always personable and professional. Seems to have rapport with many other regulars besides myself. This place has made a rough patch for me and my son much more bearable and I appreciate that.

Review: I recently gave my son a birthday party here. Everyone was nice. Great atmosphere. Kids had fun for sure. We were assigned a host that made herself available if we needed her. The host started to set the room up beforehand which was a tremendous help. I love how the parents and adults could interact with the kids apart of the package. They do allow some finger foods and they provided some pizza and drinks for the children. Overall everything was great. The only hold up was waiting for people to sign their waivers. Most of my guest signed their waivers beforehand but I wish there were someone that could have helped my guest sign waivers so that I could be attentive to my guest in the party room. Lastly, my cousin had to assist me with passing out pizza and cake, which I thought my host would do. So I was very appreciative for my cousin to help since we had to be out of the room by a specific time or else we would get charged more. I would bring my kids to there again because they did have a lot of fun.

Review: My experience there is okay. We  took our son there to play indoor since it was raining for few days. The place has a nasty smell like that it hasn't been clean. The playground feels that it hasn't been clean. The plastic balls are sticky, ring around the rosy is oily and when I climb on the stairs going to the long blue slides, I smelled gas up there. Maybe because it's next to a vent on the ceiling?  Isn't  that  unhealthy for the kids to inhale that stuff? So I had my son stayed in the lower area of the playground.

Right now it is in serious need for care and attention to detail.
Please, bring this place back to the level of safety and cleanliness it calls for because it is starting to fall apart, and it is sad to see that.
It really needs serious spring cleaning, mending and replacing certain unsafe parts.

Review: I just threw a party there 04-17-2024 and it was not worth it. I got a birthday package and they did not provide what was supposed to provide. We didn’t get the guest of honor pass. They never came to check on us. We had to keep asking for plates, cups and utensils. Something that was supposed to be provided in the room. We had to ask for the table cloth. I wish I could get my money back because it wasn’t worth it. I seen the workers walk back in forth in the party room next to ours but never came to check on us once. Waste of money and I am upset.

Review: We hosted a private “Dino-FOUR” themed birthday party at Kids Jungleland, and I cannot say enough amazing things about Stacy, the manager. From the very beginning, Stacy went above and beyond — her communication was clear, friendly, and super helpful. She guided us through planning and decision-making, explained all of our options in detail, and made the process completely stress-free.

What really stood out was her dedication. Stacy normally has Mondays off, but she made sure she was there specifically for our party — and she didn’t miss a beat. She helped carry in decorations, set up the party room, and constantly checked in to offer help or handle little things behind the scenes that made a big difference. You could tell she genuinely cared about making sure everything went smoothly!

The two party attendants working with her were also fantastic — helping with cleanup, making sure the pizza and drinks were out on time, and just keeping everything on track without ever being in the way.

The kids had an absolute blast, and honestly, I think the adults had just as much fun. I’m beyond grateful for all the help and care we received. We would absolutely consider hosting another party here again. Thank you, Stacy and the whole Kids Jungleland team, for making sure our little dude had a blast!

Review: Second time we’ve been here, our almost 3 yr old had a great time .. but unfortunately it’s not what it was a year ago when we first went. Looking a little run down, a lot of patch work, gaps in play mats, small pieces that kept falling off peg board,  broken balls everywhere not just in ball pits, bathroom floors dirty, storage area for shoes and bags was dirty.  Inside the slides and up in the jungle gym are was clean, and staff were very friendly, I did see the one gentle man duct taping and trying to fix the spike sticking out of the spinning bench .. so A for effort.. maybe close for a day and do deep clean and replace broken balls and replace the vinyl not just tape over .. it’s an awesome place for littles would love to see them continue being successful ..

Review: When walking in, the place smells a bit like weed. I assumed it was probably from the coats in the lobby so we continued in. My daughter (18mo) had a lot of fun, she really loved it. I was not a fan of the lack of supervision preventing older children from running around the toddler area as it's not safe. I am curious to know the cleaning procedures for the facility because my daughter has a pretty nasty cold. It is sick season but additional cleaning, air filtration, etc should be in place to help mitigate this. The bathrooms could use some extra attention for cleanliness. The kids seem to love it but not as clean & supervised as I would like.

Review: I am a regular customer and visited today, only to be informed that the credit card machines were not working. When my family was denied entry, I requested to speak with the manager, who was not onsite, to ask for an exception while I retrieved cash. The staff contacted the manager by phone, but she instructed them not to allow us in and refused to speak with me directly. As a result, my family had to wait at the entrance while I went to an ATM near White Marsh Mall to get cash. I strongly urge the owner to reconsider retaining this manager, whose arrogance and lack of customer care could jeopardize the future of this business.

We are always here, we come here so much that I might think I’m in all the photos ppl take when they come here🤣 it’s crazy to think that they only been here for a couple of years because my 2nd child been coming here since she was a NB and now she’s two. This is where we go when it’s too cold, too hot, or rainy outside. My kids love coming here. It’s also my fav because I don’t have to keep running around following or chasing them since we inside. It might be smaller than most of the indoor playground, but I’d say it’s one of the best indoor playground, cleanest, and all age friendly in the area.

Review: Had my son’s 2nd party there today and from the moment I walked in the woman with the arm sling(I’m assuming the manager) had the worst attitude. Not a single child in our party was given socks. We had a “helper” that didn’t help with anything. I asked him an hour and a half into our party when we would be called to the room to eat. He said “you can eat anytime”. I didn’t know I had to request for them to call us to the room. I had to ask for gloves to serve food. I had no help with anything during the party. I missed my son eating his cake because I was passing food out. We set up and cleaned up the party by ourselves. He came in at the end to sweep the floor. I was just at a party there within the last month and this was a night and day difference to how the other family was treated. We paid well over $400. I would NOT recommend this place for your child’s party. Go to Hyper Kidz in Owings Mills instead.

Review: Kidz Jungle Land has been an absolute lifesaver for our family, especially for my son, who loves having a fun and safe space to burn off his energy! We’ve been utilizing the monthly membership, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve made. The flexibility to visit as often as we like keeps my son active, happy, and engaged.

The facility is always clean, and the play areas are well-maintained, giving me peace of mind knowing my son is safe. The staff is incredible, and I have to give a special shout-out to the manager, Stacy. She makes you feel like part of the family every time you walk through the door. Her warm and welcoming nature, along with her attentiveness, ensures everything runs smoothly. The staff as a whole has been so helpful, and you can tell they genuinely care about the kids and families who visit.

If you’re looking for a place where your kids can have a blast while you feel comfortable and welcome, I highly recommend Kidz Jungle Land!

The room was great, the playground was a hit with all of the kids (and some adults, too! 😜) and the staff went above and beyond. Our party host was Stacy and she was amazing. She jumped right in to help us set up, decorated the room with us and offered her expertise on what worked best in what area, and we loved all of the suggestions. She set our table instead of just stacking the plates by the food (which is what I planned to do) She checked in on us frequently and was never too far if we had any questions. The kids loved getting to run and play and the adults loved having access to the party room for a break and to have a home base for all of our guests. Every party guest said how much fun they had and how great the room and party were. We will be visiting frequently, especially as winter approaches, and will probably end up returning for his birthday next year

but the only drawback is , Snow was accumulated only at one place and it was hard for kids to play or make the shapes and slippery. I think they should keep adjusting it before it becomes ice.
Overall id definitely recommend hosting a party at Snowy fun.

Review: Kids birthday party:

Good area to play kids and big room

Thats it and cons are:

Poor host organizations ( they show you a big picture but host are lazy workers , she put a cake on table but no knife, no light , no plate , no fork means by the time we were cutting cake there was nothing. I gave them sofa to put in freeze for pizza time , they dod not take it out left inside. Play one song and done. They dont even keep playing songs)

Pizza they order from macro pizza and they will serve you cold( people dont like it at all)

They destroy our event with poor service. If you want to destroy your than do party here otherwise try different place

Review: We had my son's 4th Birthday party here a few weeks ago and people are STILL talking about how amazing it was! The facility is huge with so much for the kids to do. The party host was very attentive and helpful. The management even helped walk me through some questions I had about payments. SNOWY FUN was a 30 min drive from my house, and an hour drive for some of our guests, but all the feedback is that it was well worth it for the amazing experience! I highly recommend SNOWY FUN for birthday parties, or just a visit for your family!

Review: All and all the kids had a great time. I was bit disappointed in a few things. 1. We did not get the guest of honor gift. 2. The birthday girl did not get to sit on the inflatable throne ( it was never inflated) 3. Our left over pizza was thrown in the trash we would’ve liked to take it with us since we paid for it. 4. There was no air filled balloons. 5. The kids were not offered boots for the snow room. Some kiddos left with wet feet.

The facility was clean, we at no point felt rushed, I was given a 10% off for the staff forgetting the throne.

The place is also never crowded. And they keep it spotless clean which is important for the young kids not catching something.

Review: I had very low expectations of this place based on pictures but this place is FUN. I love it for my toddlers cause I can keep track of them when they go in different directions. The only minimal downside is that the snow room is REAL snow. Well. As real as it can artificially get lol its cold and wet and not very convenient with toddlers. We were not clothed appropriately though so thats our fault. We had just assumed it was all foam but this alternative is better. Great prices, great music and ambiance. The staff is all very sweet and the owner listens and cares about his customers. We threw our daughters birthday party here after visiting a few times and it was nearly perfect. Snags here and there but nothing that wasn’t fixed. Our party host was great at multitasking and helping us set up/run the whole party. Will definitely be back 😊

Review: Super fun place to go and spend a day. Nice to get a couple snowballs thrown at me in the middle of DFW. Bouncers galore with a bunch of different features. Dinged one star for there being an unmonitored emergency exit tucked in a little alleyway that serves as an exit to one of the massive bounce obstacle courses; seems like trouble waiting to happen.

Review: My son had his 5th birthday here and everyone had a blast! One of his friends said it was the best party she has ever been to! We rented out the whole place and it was such a great value. We had two helpers to set up all the decorations as well as take them down. They also served the birthday cake, and boxed up all our leftovers as well. I didn’t have to lift a finger, which means I had time to mingle with the guests. Ari was one of their names, but they were both fantastic!  The owner was also very responsive to texts which helped with the planning as well.  The only improvement I would have would be the jump house slides are not smooth enough, I noticed many kids going down and hitting a rough patch on the slide and bouncing down. This was so minor, but just wanted to provide some feedback.  Everyone had so much fun especially in the snow room which the owner worked tirelessly to fix prior to our party! We are so grateful for that, and look forward to booking with them in the future!

Review: I booked this venue before ever stepping foot inside due to the location and amenities offered. Summer birthday with an ice room? Why not?! To my surprise, my daughter had a blast and talks about her birthday at Snowy Fun still!  The party rooms are the biggest we’ve had at a venue which I can appreciate because it’s not only the kids we are catering to, the kids’ parents also need a place to sit while the kids are enjoying their time. I have a few suggestions for party hosts and party structure to make the transition from one party to the next a lot smoother - 1) hosts should organize and plan ahead for each party and prepare supplies and utensils in advanced to avoid having to leave the room during the party causing delays. 2) if only there was a way to allow each party to separate into the trampoline and play area without having to mix in and share with turn crowd - similar to Pump it up’s technique to avoid chaos. Lastly, have an option for gratuity to add for party hosts during check out.  Overall, the owners are kind and accommodating and hopefully these recommendations are helpful and does not come off rude. We would return as the kids had so much fun there! We also appreciate not allowing older kids to jump with young kids because you know kids aren’t aware and don’t look out for the younger ones.

The staff was very friendly. The birthday rooms were small, but they fit our birthday party just fine. The pizzas for the party were 'catered' in from Mr. Jim's Pizza.

Review: Walked in with my husband, 6 year old daughter and 4 year old son. The front desk staff were busy so we went to the restroom. My husband and son exited the restroom first. They were asked to wait outside the building because there was a private kids party. A worker opened the womens restroom door several times leaving it open while my daughter and I used the restroom. When we exited the bathroom stall we were told the party is private and to leave. We couldn't even wash our hands! There were no signage anywhere! How were we to know!

You made my 4 year old son wait outside the building until we exited the restroom and left the womens restroom door open while my 6 year old used it! You compromised my childrens safety and didn't even ask what we needed or how you could help us! It's a way to appropriately handle things but clearly you didn't care. Never been treated this way at a CHILDRENS facility!!!!!

We enjoyed having a slideshow of pictures of our daughter continuously playing in the room, all of our guests enjoyed that. Staff was very helpful and kind!  We enjoyed our celebration here! Perfect for toddler birthday parties.

Review: Vaseem is by far the worst and disrespectful owner I’ve encountered at a kids’ indoor playland. I visited Dino Kidz with my children on a Tuesday afternoon, about two and a half hours before closing time. I had previously purchased a 10-pass package and planned to use it. However, the front desk staff told me the pass had expired back in December of last year.

This confused me because I clearly remembered visiting recently, so I asked when my last visit was. The staff checked and confirmed that I had been there in February of this year. That means I had already used the pass even after it supposedly expired, and at that time, no one informed me that the pass was no longer valid. In fact, I was told I had two passes remaining.

When I pointed out this inconsistency, the staff allowed me to speak with the owner, Vaseem. During the call, he told me, “You already brought your kids in for free in February—now you want to do it again?” He accused me of trying to manipulate the situation.

But the truth is, I didn’t enter for free—I had already paid for the 10-pass package in advance. He continued to imply that I was trying to get something for nothing and spoke to me with condescension and sarcasm.

At no point was I informed that my pass had expired or that I wouldn’t be able to use the remaining visits. No notice or reminder was ever sent out. As a busy mom juggling a lot, how am I expected to keep exact track of the expiry date of a kids’ indoor play pass?

Despite the fact that the place was nearly empty and closing time was approaching, and even though I was simply trying to use something I had already paid for, Vaseem told me to either purchase at least one single pass (since I had two kids with me) or leave. He claimed this was the “best favor” he could offer and told me, “Take it or leave it.”

The way he treated me—like someone trying to freeload—was incredibly insulting. I’ve visited this place many times before, often for playdates with friends. But after experiencing this petty and disrespectful behavior from the owner, I will absolutely not be returning, nor will I recommend this place to anyone else.

Review: Why is this review not 5 stars?

The gun. Everyone knows what I’m talking about. In the ball put there’s a “ball canon” that uses air pressure to shoot balls. That’s cool. Fun.

But there’s an INCREDIBLY LOUD “hammer cock and machine gun” that plays for a couple of minutes with every button press. The air pressure vacuum for it is also loud, but it’s a bass note and you can still hear yourself over it.

This sound effect is loud enough to drown out the music, any direction to your kids’ conversation. It is awful.

To the owners: TURN THIS SOUND EFFECT DOWN. I’ve asked the teenager running the facility a few times and they always kind of shrug.

Edit: Still loud as hell.

It was dirty, you could see black residue on all the soft play things. There’s a strong smell when you walk in. We were there an hour and a half and never saw anyone cleaning, or disinfecting anything. Will absolutely not be going back. Definitely don’t recommend for any kid under 5 at the youngest.

Not only did my husband and I talk to her 4 times to go over everything for our daughter’s birthday party but ALSO clarify that we would have the event center rented out to ourselves and the guest we invited. We had over 40 ppl in the tiny room they have. Its was so crammed and uncomfortable. We spend over a thousand dollars for the worst experience for our daughter and ourselves. I was and am so upset of how bad the experience was. I write this to say PLEASE double check everything because they have people who don’t know how to plan birthday parties.

The facility was very clean and the staff were friendly and accommodating. While I would highly suggest everyone to book Dino Kidz for their child’s birthday party, I do have a couple of suggestions for the owner/management.

1. Shorten the dance party. After a couple songs, the kids lost interest and just wanted to play. I’m sure this varies with age.
2. Order from a different pizza place. Several of the kids didn’t care for the pizza. And kids eat anything.
3. Wrap the gift from your facility for the birthday kid! All kids like to open presents. It will make the gift more appealing and the kid feel super special.
4. If you are going to have machines with “play card” options, maybe include a couple free cards pending which party package the family chooses.

Review: We just wasted $670 on a terrible birthday experience for my 3 y/o. Completely Unknowledgeable staff. Zero help, zero direction, zero communication. Literally felt like we paid for a room. Young kid that was suppose to be assisting stood in a corner the whole time. I had to go up to him multiple times to ask what was happening “umm you can tell everyone they can dance”. It was embarrassing as all my guest felt awkward and lost as well. I  then went to whom I thought was the boss, she was also absolutely no help. Zero apologies. Had to ask if I needed to serve pizza. Had to ask for juice. It was so bad. Slow to do everything but extremely quick to ask for us to leave and for the final deposit. Which was rudely asked for in front of guest. And one of the most upsetting things; I was never told that it was an additional fee (nor is this pricing listed online) to close the play area to the public (different from other locations) so to our surprise had soooo many other kids there.
I called Jill (in charge of parties based out of Allen location) and whom had been great and super responsive. She seemed extremely concerned and was very apologetic.
Final verdict- they refunded me $50!! And one free visit. - a complete joke.
Save your money go elsewhere. We had last years party at cheeky monkey and it was complete day and night experience. Never again.
We have visited this location before and I should have known by the lack of attentiveness of staff on this visits how this would end. Kids up front on their phone the entire time. And when I asked about booking a party I was swatted away and told it was all done online, later debunked by Jill.

Review: We could not be more excited to have a Dino Kidz location so close to us. As a first time mom, knowing how hot Texas summer get, it was important to me to find great indoor activities that my toddler could enjoy. We have visited many indoor children's play centers but Dino Kidz really stepped up the bar. They created a beautiful space specifically for toddler aged little ones. The atmosphere is colorful and full of natural light. The dinosaur theme is adorable and the play stations provide the perfect opportunity for each little one to let their creativity and imaginations run free. No matter if your baby is a crawler, climber or a walker there is so much fun to be had. Friendly staff, clean and plenty of seating when it's time for a snack break.

Review: My youngest loves this place, it’s great for little kids.

Pros:
> New equipment and everything works.
> Clean
> Next to a coffee/pastry shop
> Nicely located in a quiet and less busy area.
> Lots of parking

Cons:
> Not much options for drinks and snacks… bring your own or buy it next door.
> Only one parents inside at a time.
> Brings socks but they do provide socks for purchase for a fee.
> Limited seating… we ended up sitting on the uncomfortable high chairs.

There was also a dance party and a bubble party while we were there. Plenty to do to keep the kids entertained. Facility was clean and I could see the staff working there constantly cleaning during our time there as well.
Will be coming back!

Review: Today was an amazing day at Hyper Kidz! First off, it was super empty — which was perfect because my kids had all the space to run around and play without feeling crowded or overwhelmed. It honestly made the whole experience so much more relaxing.

I also have to give a shoutout to Nina at the front desk! I was standing there filling out waivers, feeling hot (because I’m always hot lol), and she was so sweet and offered me her fan while I was up there. Little things like that go a long way and really made me feel taken care of. 💕

We’ll definitely be back. Great space, friendly staff, and today was just one of those days where everything went right. Thank you, Hyper Kidz!

Review: This place is always fun for the kids and grown ups, but I have to say I was disappointed by the foul language being used by the employees in the “lobby” area. It was more than once, and more than a casual slip up it was pretty consistent in their conversation with one another.

Review: Staff is super friendly and bathrooms are clean. Been going here for a couple years and the same areas between the mesh on the playground haven't been cleaned since we started going there. Piles of deflated play balls. Dust hanging for the playground equipment all over. They really need to do a deep cleaning throughout the play area.

Review: We've visited this place multiple times over the past two years and have experienced it in various conditions. In June 2024, we saw positive improvements—the floors were replaced, equipment was repaired, and new toys were added. However, by December 2024, the facility had deteriorated significantly. The play area was filthy, with spilled Goldfish crackers and cheese stick wrappers scattered around. Equipment was covered in dust and fingerprints, the air was musty and humid, and several pieces of equipment were broken.

The bathroom conditions were particularly bad. The women's restroom needs a new soap dispenser, as excess soap drips onto the floor, creating a large puddle. Another dispenser has a sign stating it's clogged, which means both dispensers are unreliable. Additionally, the sock policy isn’t consistently enforced—some children play without socks, and kids frequently move balls from the ball pit into the building block area, creating a safety hazard since most children walk there.

To improve cleanliness and safety, I recommend that staff conduct hourly walkthroughs to pick up trash, vacuum dirty areas (including the shoe area), wipe down equipment, and organize toys. Broken balls and damaged building blocks should also be removed regularly. A deep cleaning at least once a year would help tackle dust buildup in hard-to-reach areas.

On the positive side, despite the broken equipment and cleanliness issues, we still manage to have fun here. We also appreciate the convenience of the available snacks and drinks.

In summary, this place has potential but suffers from inconsistent maintenance. When properly cleaned and maintained, it’s a great spot for kids to play. However, poor upkeep—especially in the play area and bathrooms—makes visits less enjoyable. Regular cleaning, better enforcement of policies, and occasional deep cleaning would make a huge difference. Some families have mentioned catching bugs after visiting, though we haven’t personally experienced that issue.

Review: One of the cleanest facilities like this in the area. Sometimes facilities like this can be neglected but this one seems to keep up it's cleaning routine. The play structures are solid. Some facilities seem to wake or away. This one is rock solid. Very well built. The plastic slide could use one or two more inner tubes. Other than that all the kids were having a blast. Only bad thing is your kids won't want to leave.

Review: We've been here afrw times. I bring my twins often, and have since they were 3 they are now 6. Over the years I guess the owner cares less and less about the place. The jungle gym itself is covered in dirt and dust (aka dead skin) of you stand at the entrance of the jungle gym and look at the top there are dust bunnies bigger than cat. The entire thing really needs a deep clean. It's also quiet until a kid hits the alarm and a awful drone sound begins that makes your head wana explode, this is the only place I've gone to that doesn't have music of somekind playing.  After today I do think this will be our last time going.

Review: We took our son a couple of times here.  In December 2024, after my husband took him there, my son got sick.  Gradually all of us got sick.  Again, I took my son here yesterday, then he got a cough and a lot of snot in the morning (my husband was the same because sleeping next to him )and then he became a fever then I did after. I think in this winter all germs are still around inside. They need to clean and sterilize/sterilize all of inside play areas.  Otherwise I can’t take my son anymore.  A friend of mine also said the same things.
To be honest every time we went, the stuff wasn’t nice.
But my son had so much fun here, was running all over. It’s nice place to play. That’s why I want them to go over / make sure.
Some spots are still broken. Like one of air balls didn’t work.
Should you do air circulation every day, sterilized some toys as well.

All you need is a dessert they supply litteraly everything else food,drinks cups, plates, tabel covers. It's only like $350 for all that and 10 kids or 20 for like 100 more nice size party room.  Super friendly staff, everything is clean. We go on rainy days sometimes it's pretty affordable they have a monthly pass also.

Review: My child is 2 years old and we have been here multiple times on weekdays.

My kid loves to play at the tot zone but there are always children older than 3 years old.
I have never complained about this, but during today's visit, two girls over 3 years old blocked the tot zone slide and kept my child away.
I didn't know where these children's parents were, and no one stopped them to do.

So I went to the front desk and asked, isn't the tot zone only available for children up to 3 years old, and the answer was ""everyone can get in.""
Then why did you write “Tot zone (ages 0 to 3) ” in big letters? Is it fair to inform consumers that there is a tot zone, but in reality anyone can get in there?

It was a very very disappointed experience.
I will never want to visit again.

Review: Came for a birthday party. We've never been here before. Very crowded and loud so it makes it difficult to hear them announce over the intercom when it's time for your party to go have cake and pizza. Very limited places for parents to sit which is bad if you have a bad back like myself. Very disorganized hosts, too. When we first arrived, we told them that we were new and here for a birthday party and the hostess didn't give us any information as to how this place works...basically winging it as I sit here and type. I had to come up and ask if we could finally enter beyond the gated area
Also, the kids all got separated and we're playing separately because it was so crowded. Never coming back! Place seems very clean, though. UPDATE: We missed the party because we couldn't hear the name of our host being called. Terrible! I miss Hopper's in Eldersburg!

You can smell the dust just sitting there and  the floors are disgusting. When I spoke to the attendant, I was told that they’re going to clean it up sometime after memorial day that they were working on a new place in Virginia. I suggest to the owners that you learn how to maintain what you have before you start a new venture. you will also find that you will lose customers a whole lot faster than you got them.

Review: I've never been a fan of this indoor playground, but the kids enjoy it. It's not the kind of place that makes it easy for parents to see their children at all times or that is well staffed for safety and cleanliness. Some of the electronic features have been broken seemingly for months, there is debris accumulating between play spaces, and there is general evidence the owners and staff don't care, e.g. the foam legos break often as noted by the pile of broken and tossed aside bricks in a makeshift storage area clearly visible immediately adjacent to the play space. Parents check out and let their kids climb slides and run over younger kids, often even in the toddler play space. Again, no staff is visible maintaining any space or ensuring safety for all. Bottom line: it's a gross indoor playground that is falling apart with indifferent owners and staff.

Review: I used to give this indoor playground a 5 star. Today, I brought my three kids and as I entered, the air was musty. It was crowded and the a/c setting was in the 70s! The area now is very dirty. The bathroom is nasty. The 2 staff are cocky when I asked for the air quality to be improved because it is crowded and the air wasn't circulating at all they werent interested to make the change until I asked to talk to the owner. They only gave me an email to contact not the phone of the onwer. They weren't opening the doors to let out the musty air and let fresh aowner. One of the staff sprayed an air freshener instead which is not very healthy to mix with a non circulating air. One of my kids is allergic to air freshner to make matters worse. The floors are dirty and not swept and not mopped clean. This place used to be sanitized, clean and fresh but the condition today was below average. The bathroom was dirty and stinky. I had to keep going outside to get some fresh air because the air quality is giving me a lot of headache already. I hope this improves as we really love to support local businesses in our town.

Review: Comparable to Bubala and could even be better than Bubala if the facility was better maintained; many of the sections were broken (and remain broken since we've returned). It seems like this place does very well so I do not understand why repairs haven't taken place. Not to mention, every time we've gone, the restrooms are incredibly dirty. I realize it's a busy place, but all the more reason for frequent cleaning. Lastly, and maybe this is just a peeve, but the storage in between the playpens with the unsightly boxes and whatever else just reaffirms the carelessness for appearance. I do get that it's an indoor children's playground (aka madhouse) but folks are paying a lot of money for their children to play here. All in all, my children did have fun but my toddler was very frustrated that only one ball tube worked. I'm sure we'll be back but not as often as they'd like; a bit pricey when you consider the above.

Review: Quality of staff has lowered significantly; we went today at a quiet time and the girl behind the desk had to take her headphones off just to check us in where we weren’t asked for our information or to sign a waiver. The second employee was just reading a book. I wouldn’t see this as an issue, but when we told them that a child had tracked blood throughout the playground, it took a good bit of time for them to actually get up with a disinfectant wipe and wipe the immediately obvious spots without doing a complete walkthrough of the entire facility. This poor cleaning standard is reflected throughout the facility as there is an easily visible thick layer of dust on just about every surface that can’t be reached without a step stool. The storage of extra materials under the equipment is understandable and a strong effort is made to keep children from these areas, but the amount of dust and random socks/trash under there could definitely be fixed.

Along with the lack of investment in time to clean, there doesn’t seem to be much investment into up keeping the equipment. I’m sure it’s expensive to repair and maintain, but some things really should be prioritized. I saw safety nets that are torn and tied together with string, many of the seams are tearing on everything, the tubes for the slides are deflated, and the one attraction that allows you to spin the inner ring has been duct taped so many times that where the tape has worn there is exposed metal.

We used to have a great time here, I’m not quite sure what happened!

Review: This place is amazing with young kids. Lots of activities to do from slides to climbing through wire nets and ball pits. Great for birthday parties. My only issue is with ventilation, last time we went it was very humid inside due to all the sweat and warmth of so many people and kids running around inside and you could smell the sweat. The owners should either limit the number of people or do something about the ventilation.

Review: Our kids really enjoyed this indoor playground. 60 to 90 minutes is probably long enough for them to do everything multiple times. It's a good value too. It's  intended for children under 13. There's minimal if any staff walking around the playground so expect to police your children and check on them once in a while if you weren't already going to do that.

Review: Our previous visits to Me land were enjoyable, but our most recent experience on Saturday, Jan 20th was disappointing. I'm saddened to say that the place was absolutely filthy, adults were not being supervised not that they should need but it seems that common sense is not so common for some people as they had their shoes on in the play area dragging all the melted snow and dirt from outside. Not only was the floor dirty, there were big hairballs, napkins, water bottles and all kinds of trash all over the place. I approached the employees and kindly asked if someone could pick up the trash on the play area,  there were four employees standing at the register, one of them say they will and never did, we stay an hour and not one single employees picked any of the trash or asked the people with shoes to take them off. Also, the same employees were wearing the shoes inside the area. It is a shame that such a nice place turned into a filthy area. A suggestion for improvement would be to consider getting better employees or implementing effective management to ensure a cleaner and more pleasant environment. I'll be happy to change my review once issues have been addressed.

Review: This place is run down now. We came in on MLK day and were not thrilled at how filthy this place was. I think it’s time for updated equipment as well as a good clean. I also feel like there should be a limit of how many people they are letting in on busy days. Definitely not a good experience, and definitely not the same MeLand we were used to when we first started coming years ago. Also the customer  service/friendliness could use some work as well.}","Maryland","melandplay.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","21704"

Review: From start to finish, they were wonderful to work with for my son’s birthday party. Clear and fast communication, flexible with changes, and their party host on the day of was helpful, polite, and just all around great.  The decorations that they provide were nice enough, I could have done without be bringing anything extra. We had a great time and it was so easy to just enjoy his birthday and not stress over anything. Highly recommend for parties!!

Review: It’s ok… deff not suitable for younger kids. Came here to just try it out because my kiddo loves totsville. He did enjoy some of the play structures but my 4 stars is mainly for cleanliness and the overall look of the facility. It appeared to be very dirty especially the play mats and some of the structures just look very unclean. There were also a lot of things like the ball guns that just didn’t work at all, or caution tape around things, it just didn’t look very presentable. When my kiddo is older I’d deff prob come back just not on the weekend. Pretty packed and most don’t watch their children leaving them to knock down or throw things at younger kids. We will stick to totsville for now

Review: The place itself is fun for kids, the customer service wasn’t great though. We arrived at opening (10am) and it wasn’t open yet. All lights were off and the doors were locked. The “manager” eventually showed up to unlock the doors at 10:15am. No greeting, no apology for not having the place open and ready to go for customers, no interaction whatsoever. It wasn’t the best first impression for new customers.

Review: If you haven’t been in a while, don’t go expecting what it was a few years ago. More than half of the equipment was broken, or gone. There are holes in the climbing, making it unsafe - as kids can climb on top of the structures. Caution taped off areas all over. There was also cleaning supplies left out in the climbing structures. I watch my kid - but for others, that could be detrimental. I wouldn’t recommend this place at ALL.

My second favorite part is there climbing structures are all connected. Don’t waste your time with any other play places and come to this one! Also did I mention they do birthday parties?

Review: I would NOT recommend location birthday parties only for kids to enjoy the playground and have fun but outside of that , our party Experience was an ABSOLUTE Nightmare. Unfortunately, today we were unable to enjoy our party with constantly being followed around by the new host to the point where she climbed up on a playground to deliver the bill mid party. There was no organization or Communication!,  to be honest We would’ve operated better without a host. it was more like being policed & rushed out the room.
And as for the  manager Yaya whom Completely lacks customer service to start with she wasn’t allowing Guest due to the fact that we paid before their arrival, we wasnt not notified  about our guest & took 5minutes for her to understand that we’re willing to pay for the xtra children, and unfortunately, she’s telling my guess it’s a $21 fee perchild yet told me right in front of them that it was a $17 fee.  the way miss yaya sat outside the party room staring through the window at 7:10 pushing for is to leave At 7:15 is when we was suppose to clean up. Remind you where the last party of the day at that point, the only party of there. We basically got treated like we were unwanted and thieves for having a birthday party. I didn’t get the assitant managers name, but she has been nothing but outstanding customer service and understanding should be the main one managing!!
I really wish I would’ve took pictures, but I was trying to enjoy my child party & like i said I would  recommend location birthday parties unless you want completely surcharged for lack of Communication & a headache.

Review: “I had a very disappointing experience at Kidzville. The entrance fees are outrageously high for what they offer, and it doesn’t feel like you get your money’s worth at all. The safety standards are lacking; I noticed several areas that weren’t secured, which made me worry about my kids’ safety. Additionally, the staff was rude and unhelpful, which made the whole visit unpleasant. I expected a family-friendly environment, but Kidzville falls short. I won’t be returning and wouldn’t recommend it to other parents.”

Review: The two armed male security guards haven’t been onsite the past few times I’ve visited. They made my family feel safe, as we saw them handle serious altercations among feuding patrons. Some of Kidzville’s clientele is unsavory, and you need strong, armed men there to deter and address dangerous behavior. Please beef up the security presence again, or my family will not feel safe spending time at Kidzville anymore.

Review: Typical loud, crowded, kid playground except also full of adults yammering away on their cellphones and screaming at their kids. Adults have to wear socks too, so if you’re throwing a party have the forethought to put that on the invite. They got a little too excited about making me buy socks when I was only wearing sandals. Seems a little scammy and overpriced. Lots of better options for a birthday party in the area. Would not recommend.

Review: A fun facility with varied activities, but their policy of allowing massive camp groups in during the summer weekdays can swamp the facility for other kids. They should limit group sizes.

June 2023 - Positive update. It was closing time and we were the only people there getting ready to leave. Several employees came out to clean, spray and wipe down the areas of this massive playground. Highly impressed with everyone here.

actively engaged in watching and helping kids. They are constantly cleaning and the place is massive, so much to do from the many obstacle courses to bikes to bumper cars, imaginative play, ball pits, foam pits, slides everywhere. I didn't come expecting to play but I'm an adult and I had a ball. We can't wait to come back. There's also food. We stayed here for hours. Our favorite bounce place now hands down.

Review: Fun slides in a location geared towards little kids. They are consistently cleaning the high traffic areas. Love there's a section for even smaller children. The spa music is a nice touch.

My friend who frequents the establishment states that the ball pit was much lower than usual. I found trash in the play jungle gym as I went through with my kids.  Some of the interactive toys, such as foam Legos, are torn or broken. They have massage chairs, but they are prohibitively expensive. There is less room for exploration because they prefer all toys to stay in their original area. There are signs for no outside food or drink, but there's also a very limited in-house menu. I did not notice if they have allergen accommodations.

All in all, an okay spot.

Great place and had a lot of fun with friends and family. Now, I will say that I earned some bruises and scrapes because those play areas are not meant for adults, soft padding, or not. Be warned! The kids had fun, and they were moving extremely fast through everything! I couldn't keep up!! I would love to go back. Just not when they are ever busy, haha. Also, we asked the staff to turn on the air conditioning multiple times. Each time, they said that they did. But it didn't get any cooler. Which leads me to assume that something was wrong with the system or that they simply didn't turn the system on as they had said.

Review: I came to Me Land to attend my grandson's birthday party. As a place for kids, it's fantastic — no complaints there. However, when it comes to customer service, I have to say it was very disappointing and needs a complete overhaul.

Starting with the front desk, I felt like I was imposing on their time. While they were friendly, they didn’t come across as very welcoming. I essentially had to coach them into giving me the information I needed to find the party.

Another issue arose when it was time to leave. The staff members who came into the party room were disrespectful — they saw that we were in the process of breaking down and cleaning up, yet they just turned off the lights on us. How unprofessional!

I would recommend Me Land for kids to play, but I would not suggest using them to host a party. While I'm not sure about the cost to host an event there, I believe you can find a better and host your party elsewhere.

Review: Some of the equipment are broken, and they raised the prices from $18 to $25 on weekends. The employees' behavior at the checkout is horrible. They give you a big look, as if you're asking for a free pass.  The children leave more stressed than happy because the employees at the register yell at them and their parents. This was my experience at this place. I don't recommend them at all.

And I went to ask for the manager, they told me he wasn't there and the girl hid because she knows she was very rude instead of coming politely to tell me.

Review: I am giving the facility this rating based on our positive experiences and my hope that what I’m about to describe was just a misunderstanding or coincidence. We are happy here and have always been treated kindly by staff. We are a white family.

Today upon arrival we were told that the credit card machine was not working. However, a staff member got on the phone with a technician and was able to charge my credit card while he was following their troubleshooting instructions.

Then a black family came in and was told the credit card machine was not working, and they left.

Later when my son was done playing I bought him a juice box and paid for it with my credit card with no issue.

I can’t prove that the credit card machine magically worked both times I needed it and not when the other family was trying to pay admission, but it feels like the staff was trying to deny them admission and they used the credit card machine as an excuse.

Review: Had a party for my son on march 1st 2025, the people who work here are not properly trained. Prior to booking the party I was never informed I had to pay an extra 50 bucks for a room which is insane I had multiple conversations with them regarding booking. When arriving they gave me a section which was very small I had 30 children plus adults, they did not care to accommodate and fix the issue a manager has yet to get back to me. a friend of mine informed me that The Fredrick location only offers rooms no sections & there's no extra fee to have a room. I paid this place 800 bucks 600 for the party and extra 200 for the extra kids which was 25 per child. That doesn't include the tip for the party host. BOTTOM LINE THIS LOCATION IS A RIP OFF THEY CHARGE MORE THAN THE FREDERICK LOCATION I should've booked with them instead.

Review: This location has gone down in quality and not worth the price. The staff seems to only focus on charging people entrance. There is no one that goes around who cleans, maintains, or resets any of the play areas.

Almost all of the props from the mini town are missing So it’s just empty playhouses. All the pegs for  the light board in the baby area missing as well. That was my children’s favorite to play with.
The latest time that we were there, there was big kids having a ball fight in the baby area when there is clearly signs that say do not throw balls. It lasted the whole time we were there.

It is very disappointing coming back to this location and seeing how bad it has gotten especially compared to the new hyperkidz in Rockville

Review: We are very thankful Me Land exists. We were here twice during the holiday break. Especially when it’s cold outside, this is such a great place for our two energetic kids to run, climb, jump and play. I love that you can easily watch two kids of different ages at one time in this play place. The bathrooms are conveniently located and the family bathroom is a plus! Usually a play place has a little town or an indoor playground but Me Land has BOTH which makes it extra fun. Parking is never a problem and some drinks are available for purchase. I appreciate the big cubbies for storing shoes and coats. The only down side is some of the areas are a little older and maybe would benefit from some sprucing up, but all functional. We are always happy to return.

Review: We had a wonderful time at my son’s 4th birthday party. The staff was so welcoming when we arrived. They communicated that they would inform me once my room was ready. They let me use carts to hold my decorations which was so helpful. Once the room was ready, our party host immediately started to set up and bring me utensils and other items that are included in the package. Alejandro was very polite and asked me what times I wanted to start pizza cake. This helped because we had a plan for the party and time wouldn’t get passed us. He also helped with passing out food and cake. Overall, this birthday was easiest birthday I’ve ever done. Way less stressful compared to renting a community center and everything is solely on you. We had a great time. Definitely recommend this.

I asked them for the accident report and called them trying to resolve the issue. But they never responded! I will file a complaint to BBB!

Update (9/18/24): the owner still didn’t respond. They asked someone called me yesterday and said to me that my girl intended to put her finger in the door and that’s why she got hurt. No sympathy, and didn’t even ask how the little girl was doing with the injury. As a customer, I am very disappointed with how they handled this incident.

Review: This place is great.  There are so many fun things to do.  We stayed for over two hours and my four year old was completely occupied and having a great time the entire time, often playing independently while we sat and relaxed.  I think the post that says it is dirty and has pictures of discolored floors is out of date and I think the floors have been replaced since then, because all the floors are clean and bright and also a different color from those pictures.  The bathrooms were also fine.  We will definitely be back again. My son says he wants to come back every day.  One tip: bring socks.  You can buy them there, but they are required for both kids and adults, so you will save some money if you bring your own.

Only giving it 4 stars because the room (the floor/corners) and bathroom were dirty so that was a negative. I feel like for the money you pay, you basically only get play time for guests and a private room with table and benches. Maybe extending the use of the private party room by 1/2 hour to an hour more so that kids have a base camp to meet, would have made it a better experience for me.  We love this place and will return to play, however, I am just not 100% sure we will have another birthday party there.

Review: I do not recommend having birthday party at Me Land unless you have your own helpers to assist you.

My party was supposed to start at 1 pm, but the holster didn't show up until 1:30 pm.
The staff at the front desk displayed rudeness when I approached them with questions. Later, it seemed deliberate when they provided us with a faulty lighter that failed to light the birthday candle.
Plus, there were not enough good parking spots close to the door, so I had to park three minutes away and lug everything for the party. Me Land only gave me one cart to carry stuff from my car to the party room.

So, I had to take care of my supper exciting 5-year-old son at the parking lot with cars come and go while making five trips back and forth between my car and the party room, each round taking about six minutes. It was a lot to handle by myself.

The holster is limited to taking orders from you; Me Land did not train the holster to effectively host the party. If you expect to have holster that can really help you to host the party, try other gyms which I did see capable holsters in there.

I found this place while searching for local play gyms mainly because it says it’s appropriate for kids 0-12. I’m so glad this is the place we chose. It was absolutely perfect for both kids! The little ride on vehicles and “Main Street” area was a big hit with my 2 year old and the huge jungle gym kept my 8 year entertained for over 2 hours. Overall the place was clean and everything felt safe and well maintained. I’d highly recommend this place in general but especially if you have a wide age range for the kids.

They have a section dedicated to a tiny town, lots of balls to jump into, large “legos” to build with and suspended walking bridges for the kids to get their energy out on! It’s not the “fullest” Me Land we’ve been too but it is a clean and well kept one.

Review: I took my two and one year old for the first time to Me Land and was worried after reading the reviews about it not being clean but like any review, sometimes you have to take it like a grain of salt. It surpassed all my expectations and I didn’t think it was dirty at all. Granted I didn’t use the bathrooms instead I took my kids to the car to change diapers and eat but they let me and the kids back in after running out to the car.

Definitely a good place for a 2 and 1 year old. I always worry when I’m taking my kids places to play because of the age gap and keeping them from killing themselves when I turn an eye but this place was totally safe and engaging for both my kids and also myself. And the music wasn’t too loud! I was so happy that the sound wasn’t obnoxiously loud and they play GOOD music!

There’s a massive ball pit with a safe climbing area where the kids can go up padded stairs in numerous areas and walk around to different slides. There’s enough space for kids to spread out and play :)

For babies, they have a nice area with a small ball pit and a HUGE light Bright board and foam blocks.

Staff were nice and pleasant and didn’t appear to hate their jobs which I wouldn’t have really cared one way or the other because I’m sure it’s difficult listening to screaming kids and parents all day.

So over all, this place earned its 5 star review and I do plan on returning!

Review: The fee per child is $24. This place is unusually polluted. The floor is dirty and black.  When I requested shoe covers because I was disgusted, the manager refused saying it was not according to their policy. The maintenance and level of cleanliness of the place does not even aim for one star. The staff is lazy and useless. Unfortunately, this is how money is made today at the expense of people's backs! I will never return to this place nor do I recommend it!

Review: I’ve visited many indoor playgrounds, but Kids Jungle World is one of my favorites! It's exceptionally clean and has a calm, welcoming atmosphere. It's a perfect place for toddlers to play, especially when the weather isn’t great outside. The colorful theme and variety of rides make it fun for both little ones and older kids. Everyone can enjoy at their own pace. I really like this place!

Review: We visited Kidz Jungle World on Christmas Eve, and it was an absolute delight! Despite being a busy holiday, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better. The play equipment was impressively clean, showing the care and effort put into maintaining the facility.

One of the standout features for us was the high weight limit on the equipment, allowing parents to join in the fun without worry. It’s also fantastic that parents enter for free – a thoughtful touch that sets this soft play centre apart from others.

The entrance fee being a whole-day pass is excellent value, and we appreciated the flexibility it gave us. Our two-year-old absolutely loved exploring all the different areas, and we would have stayed even longer if we didn’t have other commitments.

Overall, we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend Kidz Jungle World to anyone looking for a fun, family-friendly outing. It’s a perfect spot for kids to play, laugh, and burn off energy while parents can relax or join in. A solid 5/5 experience!

On the day of her party the staff made sure everything went smoothly. Leading up the party, I received a call to ensure I understood everything and to help with anything else I needed. I’m thankful for their care of their customers and making accommodations even at the last minute. The kids had fun and so did the adults!

Review: Balls are extremely DIRTY!!! Black dirt all over most of the balls in the ball pit! They do not clean them at all, but they charge the same price as places that clean their balls. Don’t let your kids play at this place until they CLEAN their ball pit!!!! So upset that this is a kids facility and they have a ball pit that looks neglected.

Review: I've been coming to Jungle Kids world since it opened. The customer service has been consistently kind, helpful, and quick (at reception). Over the past two years the gun machine have never been working when we go. Now the machine that makes the balls pop up doesn't work. And the tube that sucks up balls also doesn't work and so that means the area where the balls collect cannot be used to make all the balls fall down. The tree swing was gone and the metal Zipline that my son lives was also broken. The floors felt sticky. I feel like this place is on the decline. I hope they get it together. It's very disappointing. We come here often because it's close to my house and the kids love it. In fairness they did still have a good time. So one star for customer service and one for the kids having a good time.

Review: Highly recommend. My almost 3 year old had a fantastic time and after 1.5 hour’s he is worn out and satisfied. They had so many obstacles and my son didn’t want to leave. Take your child here if you want to tire him/her out.

One of the things that stood out was the front desk employee Arnetia. You can tell she genuinely loves her job! I observed her and she treated everyone with such kindness. We came near closing time and not once did we feel rushed to leave. The entire time she kept busy mopping and cleaning (which by the way as soon as you walk in you can smell the cleanliness of the place). When she wasn’t cleaning she was happily engaging with the children making sure they were safe. It’s rare that I meet someone with such a gentle and sunny disposition. Arnetia is the kind of employee you want representing your company. I hope someone in corporate reads this. Keep hiring employees like her and you’ll stay in business for years to come.

I have held two birthday parties at this location within the past 2 years and both experiences were excellent. The staff has timely communications, is very friendly and is very attentive even to last-minute changes. The birthday packages are flexible and very reasonably priced. I had a birthday party for my son here last weekend and everyone had a wonderful time including the parents because there are plenty of places for parents to hang out. Fun, cleanliness and affordability check check check!! Thank you so much Kidz Jungle World I really appreciate you!!

Review: What a fantastic experience. The kids had a blast for over 2 and a half hours and there was a variety of things for all ages to do (18 months - 8 years in our group). The woman working was phenomenal in making sure the environment was clean and safe and went above and beyond in showing me a easy way to the slide for me and the littlest one to slide down together without having to climb through the whole structure. Additionally, she went out of her way to show the kids how to fill the foam ball blower so that the balls cascaded everywhere to the delight of the children. The largest play structure has a variety of passages, but all of the entrances and exits are condensed toward the front for easy viewing from the two smaller play areas where parents would accompany younger children allowing them to also keep and eye on their older ones. We can't wait to go again in the future!

They kept the children entertained, we had dance parties, the kids showed the bunny their dance moves and we even had a little dancing with the adults doing the Cupid shuffle with the bunny. The employees made it fun for everyone including the adults. We were all running around trying to find golden eggs with the kids and it was just a time.

Review: I have been taking my daughter here for a few years and she loves it! We hosted her 4th birthday party and it was perfect! The kids had a great time, everything was pristine clean. The staff decorated the private area and were on top of absolutely everything!! Fantastic place for anyone with kids 1 to 7 years old.

Review: Love this place, but they need to replace a lot  of the play toys that are dirty and have faded over time. Some of the stuffed toys in the vet office need to be replaced and put in a washing machine for a thorough cleaning. Otherwise, this is a great place to take young, walking toddlers!

Review: I recently hosted my daughter's 3rd birthday party here and was overall very pleased. I liked that the space allowed room for kids to play freely and the adults could sit centrally and watch. I thought the service was also wonderful- Rowena made herself available to answer questions and guide me in terms of what works well based on her experience.  I dropped the decorations off the day before, so the staff set everything up for me and it was all set when I arrived the day of. The staff was very helpful and attentive, made sure things were clean and that I didn't forget anything. Afterwards they helped cleanup. Most importantly the kids had a great time.
Overall it made for a great birthday party!

Working with Rowena was great! She made it easy to plan since I am a bit OC. I plan things to be perfect. Some people who do not understand that, may get frustrated when you want to do things a certain way, but Rowena understood, accommodated my needs and helped me set up the afternoon before the party. You can leave set up to them which is what most usually do and just drop off your decor. You can tell she's passionate about her business. Her staff on that day was very helpful as well! The kids had a lot of fun!!! The kids age range were 1-5 years old and they loved it! Packages include pizza and juice for the kids! Thank you Rowena & Kids Play Gallery for being the tiny town in our area & for hosting an awesome event! Totally recommend having your child's birthday party here & coming if you just need a place for them to run around, play and enjoy!

One time I had to leave 1/2 hour earlier as requested by one of the employees because they were hosting a private party. I m not going to lie. It really got bothered by it 😕. We paid full price and we came late, we couldn't enjoyed much that day.

Review: Posted 3/29/2024

There’s not very many indoor play areas for younger toddlers so I was happy to discover this place. It’s a cute play environment,  and I wanted to reserve semi-private party. ($499 for 12 kids,  20 adults) for my daughter on a Sunday morning. However, I had to go through the manager/owner and her customer service skills are less than stellar - constant interruptions and roundabout answering. All I wanted to know was why advertise entrance fee of $18/kid (weekdays)/$20/kid (weekends) for “all day play” when that’s not applicable for party rentals (that fact should be clearly stated their the website) as all party members have to vacate both the party room AND the Kids Play Gallery when the agreed upon two hour duration has reached even though the $499 party rental fee includes the $240 (12 kids X $20 entrance fee) entrance fee. Needless to say, I am looking for a different place to have my daughter’s party.

Reaction to ventor review posted on 4/21/2024:

The above review was an honest costumer review who had visited with her husband and 18 mo toddler to play at Kids Play Gallery once before, and after an interaction with both your employee in-person at the Play Gallery and a phone call with the manger/owner regarding for a semi-private 12 children/20 adult $499 package. I gave my opinion and reaction based on what I had read on your website (at the time) and stated facts that were quoted, PLUS on the ""less than stellar"" (as stated in my post) phone customer service by the owner (which was not addressed in your reaction). How is that ""trying to hurt"" your small business? There will several points that I raised that were red flags in my review of the Kids Play Gallery; your party policy was the least of my overall negative reaction - it was the rude attitude in which I was treated and my questions addressed. It was not because I wanted to nickel and dime a small business. A part of running a business is to try take ALL reactions and comments to your business neutrally and make the changes.

Review: The facility itself is very nice, clean, and creative! I love the little shops - it’s made to look like a little town that’s toddler size. The only thing I didn’t like was the customer service. The people at the front desk aren’t very polite and they are overly strict on things that should be a little flexible in my opinion. For a facility that caters to children, I think the customer service should be much more exciting, perky, nice. They’re super bland and a little rude.

Review: Kids Play Gallery in Gaithersburg, MD, is a popular destination for families with young children. The play area is designed to provide a safe, stimulating environment where kids can explore, play, and learn.

One of the things that stand out about Kids Play Gallery is the variety of activities available. There are several play areas, including a soft play zone for younger children, a climbing structure, a ball pit, and an obstacle course. The gallery also has a dress-up area, a pretend play section, and a mini-golf course, ensuring that kids of all ages can find something they enjoy.

The facility is clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The management also prioritizes the safety of children, with strict rules in place to ensure that kids are supervised and that everyone follows the rules.

Parents also appreciate the convenient location of Kids Play Gallery, which is easily accessible from major highways and has plenty of parking available.

Overall, Kids Play Gallery is a fun and engaging play space that offers a wide range of activities for kids. It's a great place for families to spend a few hours, especially during inclement weather or when looking for a break from outdoor activities.

Review: We love Kids Play Gallery - both for playdates AND birthday parties! All of our friends with young kids who we have brought here have loved it too. Rowena, the owner, and her team are amazing.

1) Great activities - My kids can play for SUCH a long time (~2 hrs once!), uninterrupted, with limited help
2) Great size - It's a contained space and I can see my kids all the time without losing sight of them. Also, the entrance is secured/gated.
3) CLEAN - Rowena's team is always organizing and cleaning the space
4) FANTASTIC PRIVATE PARTY SPACE - Rowena is so easy to work with. Communicates well. Also has great decorations that I did not have to worry about. Her and her team made my 4 year old BDAY party go so smoothly for myself, our guests and the kids

I cannot recommend this space enough. Love it.

Review: Went today for the first time. Was fun for the first 30 minutes until an extremely large birthday party showed up and there were so many people that my kid and I couldn’t even walk let alone play. Paid $20 to leave after 45 minutes. It would be nice if they reserved the entire space for the party instead of letting the public in to that chaos. Don’t know if I’ll be back and risk being overwhelmed again and wasting money.

Edited to add: I see in another review that the maximum is 213 based on the square footage. That doesn’t mean that 213 people will comfortably fit in here and allow children to play. You’re forgetting some of the square footage is not a play area- it’s the lobby, the back sink and little hall area, and the closed off party room. In addition you have play equipment squeezed into this space along with your 213 people. So while it’s the maximum for safety concerns according to the county, the comfort of the people who pay should be put as first priority as safety is considered. 213 can not comfortably play here.

And even if it’s a “smaller” birthday party, there should still be regulation on how many people are allowed, anticipating the birthday party attendance. With kids and parents all running around, I literally walked into three parents and three kids just trying to get out. Again, there should be a different way to regulate it. If I had called when I planned on coming (right at 930 when it opened), I would have been told it wasn’t busy. Needs to be more organized if I’m going to pay $20 to “stay as long as you want” but realistically can only survive 45 minutes because too many people are let in. Maybe consider timed tickets in advance? But it was enough of a drive that I wouldn’t consider it if it’s only going to be another 45 minutes stay.

Review: Based on my first experience I would’ve given it five stars. The place is so cute and well thought out and my daughter really enjoyed the selection of toys. We had the place practically to ourselves and she had a blast.
However the second time was not so good. It was PACKED and half the patrons were coughing. There was a toddler who kept coming up to my baby and his face was completely full of dripping green snot. Now I understand that a facility cannot control the actions of a small child, but they can have a screening procedure that keeps obviously sick kids out of the play area. It seems like common sense that if kids are all going to be touching the same items (and the sick kid was licking everything he touched as well), sick kids should be kept out to avoid widespread illness. Sure enough a few days later both my kids are super sick. We paid to go get infected basically. Won’t be back.

Inside each house was tons of accessories, which were great for imaginative play.  Our kids were SO engaged and played literally non-stop for hours. Also, they had free WiFi and seating for parents - which is a great addition. This will be a go-to place for our family going forward.

I know they caught it from here because they hadn’t been anywhere else. I called to let them know what happened and that they should do a thorough deep clean but they didn’t seem interested or concerned. I think that’s what disturbed me the most is the nonchalant attitude. I hate that this happened cause I really like this place. But it needs to be cleaned more frequently and diligently especially during these covid times. I am happy it wasn’t covid.

Review: We went yesterday for the first time. My son just turned 3 and he had so much fun. I walked in thinking we’d spend an hour or so playing, get out of the house for a little, but we were there just shy of 4 hours, and my son still could have played longer. All the little areas are so cute and I felt each “building” was adequately equipped with toys and accessories to keep him entertained. It was extremely clean, and the worker was cleaning and disinfecting toys as the kids were finished playing with them. I also have a 5 month old, and I liked that I could sit on the benches in the middle of the room with him and still keep an eye on my older son no matter where he was playing. My son is already asking to go back, and we will most definitely be returning.

Review: There are so many wonderful things to say about Kids Play Gallery! The staff are so kind, the place is so clean, open, and organized, and the staff consistently sanitizing after a play station has been used.

The toys are for most age ranges. Infants to 6 year olds will have such a blast here. My child keeps going back to work his imagination and play. We love especially love the diner which simulates a real life diner experience where my son loves to serve me play food and coffee outside the window. We enjoy pretending we are getting haircuts at the hair salon, our cars serviced at the auto center, more gas at the gas station, saving animals at the vet hospital, shopping for groceries at the play store, building at the train area, and saving lives and fighting fire while driving the fire truck and rescuing from the fire house. IT’S SO MUCH FUN!

My son had his 4th birthday at KPG. It was wonderful. The children had a blast. I called the owner a week in advance to plan, and she contacted me for a head count. She suggested that we pay our fee the day of the event which I loved because things sometimes happen and parties don’t go as planned. It also showed their honesty and loyalty.

I threw my son a themed party, so I paid for additional decorations that I wanted, but we could have kept it more simple. What I loved was that the owner let me come in a day before to prepare and offered me a little cart to put my supplies in so I could set up. I had my son with me and he enjoyed setting up for his party.

The following day, infants to 5 year olds came to the birthday party. The kids played, had so much fun, and then an announcement was made to go to the back room for pizza and cake. The employees there helped us serve the pizza which came with our package along with juice (which had already been set up), and and sliced the cake.

This was such an amazing party and served different age ranges. The kids and the parents who joined had such a great time and could not stop talking about it. Some of them had already been familiar with KPG, but loved the idea of having a party there, while others had never been to a play area like KPG and couldn’t wait to bring their children back.

Thank you so much to the employees who made my child’s birthday party so wonderful, so organized, and fun!

Parents can also participate as well as relax on the benches provided while still keeping kids within eyesight.

My kid enjoyed the boat and fishing station as well as the police car.

Adding a few more interactive toys to the stations would make it perfect.

Review: It's a nice space.  If I were rating just on the space itself, I would give that part a 5/5.  The ""town"" is cute and well made, and wonderfully sized just for kiddos.  A lot of thought was put into the original design, and details of the kids' buildings are good.  Staff was very polite, non-intrusive.  The carpet was clean and things were generally dust free.

Safety-wise, I have some serious concerns with flaking paint from toys marked ""Made in China"" on the bottom.  The flaking paint, a 1/5....I totally didn't let my kid keep playing with those, but it was super annoying to try to check all of them before he started playing; I shouldn't have to be checking all of their worn toys to keep my kid safe.  This should have been a safe place; they should remove toys from use for either repairs or replacement when they start to pose a hazard.

I was also concerned with the lack of social distancing and lack of facemasks, when the entire target audience for this is pretty much not vaccinated (all kids <12 don't have vaccines yet.)  CDC's guidance to relax masks is primarily for outdoor spaces and non crowded spaces, where they are assuming most of the population is vaccinated.  However, none of the kids are vaccinated and not all of the adults are.  The COVID stuff, I would give maybe a 2/5 because it would have been easy for them to verbally remind people as part of the introduction, to try to keep their child/children 6ft away from others.  I totally understand that it is difficult sometimes, but some of the parents are not watching their kids at all, and only one of the kids there wore a mask at all.  All of the kids were less than 12 years old (at the time of this post, 12+ can get vaccines, but none developed for <12).  It made me want to leave, because some people just let their kids rampage into your kid and touch you kid.  Also, I don't know if or how they sanitize the food-looking toys.  It would be great if they did that more often, since kids keep putting that stuff in mouths.

Many of the toys are incomplete (train tracks missing a ton of pieces, a lot of broken parts on tracks, broken bridges with sharp parts), worn out (pink rocking horse, for example, and some of the large to vehicles), or lacking a lot of things (only one real set of food in the diner....and not many tools in the car shop).  That might work if there is only one kid playing, but kids are kids, and many kids try to play with the same things at the same time.  Would be helpful if they sort of freshened up some of the toys, a bit.  Maybe they would consider donating some of the older toys and get things where the paint isn't coming off.  When you get to your kid's eye level and play with your kid, and the toys there, you can't help but start to notice a lot of wear and tear, a lot of incomplete things, some sharp edges, etc.

Don't get me wrong; I genuinely love the concept and that it exists.  I am delighted and extremely grateful for a place my child can play, even if it is raining or extremely hot outside....but I wish they would get rid of the old, broken, or incomplete toys and replace them.  There are things like Toys for Tots or other events they could go to, to pick up more complete sets or newer toys to make the store a bit better, without spending much.

Review: We celebrated our daughter’s birthday at Kids Play Gallery yesterday and the celebration was perfect. We had a small number of people and Kids Play Gallery staff did a great job managing the event while following all guidelines to ensure that the place was clean and safe for the kids and grown ups. The planning required minimal effort on my part as the owner, Rowena and her staff handled everything very professionally. They not only did all the set up but also finished all the clean up. We ordered pizza for kids and adults through them which was delicious. They have very reasonable event packages and everyone is very friendly. We love this place as it gives the perfect amount of stimulation to 1-10 year olds and it is super fun for the parents to watch them enjoy and use their imagination while playing. We highly recommend Kids Play Gallery to all parents who are looking for a safe space to organize a fun event or a play date for their kids, or an exciting play area where kids can go to to play any day.

Review: This place is very pretty and a great place to bring your small ones. However, my experience is based on an encounter from last week which I believe was handled poorly. I have 3 small kids. I arrived at 5:00pm on the dot, after getting all 3 of them ready for ONE full hour of play.

I should mention, I have an infant, a 2 year old and a 3 year old. Their opening house on their website claims they close at 6pm. When I got there, as I was about to pay, the cashier said, ""just so you know,  you will need to leave at 5:30"" - ""excuse me?""
""yes, I need to start cleaning at 5:30, so you can't be inside the play area after 5:30"" - after going back and forth about how it says on the website they close at 6pm, she then said ""what's the difference? 5:50pm or 6? - same thing, I'm just telling you because the other day a customer got mad that I Was vacuuming while he was still inside and I don't want the same thing to happen today.""

I stated that if that was the case, they need to update their website and say they close at 5:30pm, NOT 6pm. That is false advertising. I wasn't going to pay for 3 kids for 30 minutes of play. Not to mention, she could have at least offered a discount or honor the time it said on the website. She said I should come back another day and insisted she didn't know what the big deal was. She also stated the owner was aware of that, after I asked ""is the owner aware of this?"". Owner, if you are in fact aware, that is poor handling of your business. Please update the schedule on your website or kindly have your staff start cleaning AFTER 6pm.

If you are a mom, you understand how long it takes to get 2 toddlers and one infant out of the door. We ended up going back home. Thanks for the lovely afternoon!

Review: I just had a terrible experience here. Came with my 7 month old and 4.5 year old in hopes of having fun together. AFTER I paid and when the person working the desk saw I had a baby in the stroller, she told me I was not allowed to bring in a stroller. My 7 month old had just fallen asleep (and not in the car seat because, well, read every advice column about not letting babies sleep in car seats for too long) I was so looking forward to actually playing with my 4 year old while my 7 month old was sleeping. I let my son go in to play only to be told minutes later that he was in some area he wasn't supposed to be in without socks. Not a problem except I didn't want to leave my baby. And it's principal - you won't let me bring my sleeping baby in but want me to be next to my son? I was checking my phone to see if there was any mention of no strollers on the website but there was nothing mentioned.

When I asked for my money back and had to tell my 4 year old we had to leave as this scenario was chaotic at best, she only THEN said I could bring in my stroller as long as the wheels were clean. I get it - no dirty strollers and they don't want loads of strollers jamming up the play areas. But it was not busy at all and there were so many areas I could have parked the stroller, out of harm's way.

Therefore we will never come back to this place and I'll make sure every mom who talks about this place knows about my terrible experience. Being a stay at home mom of two kids is hard enough. Even the play places make it hard on us?! There are times to make an exception and this was clearly one of them. No one would have been impacted by my sleeping baby in a stroller - the only one hurt by it was this sleep deprived mom.

There’s staff that is constantly picking up and putting all the toys back in each section which I thought was great. It keeps the place nice and organized within each section as the kids play. Parking is also free and there is plenty of it. My son (2 years old) and I were here for 3 hours and by the time we got home he was ready for a nap! *grateful* I definitely agree with the other review that says you can tell the place was very thought out!

I cannot say how time will treat this place as there were maybe 20 children playing when we were there and it was manageable...with more kids it could get crazy. Also, the staff will have to stay on top of cleaning all toys well because alot of the items encourage creativity, which is great until they all put the fake food in their mouth or comb their hair at the salon. Time will tell - we had a great time.

Review: Jolly Yolly Kids is one of those rare places where everything just clicks—fun, safety, and a real sense of care. The space is bright, well-organized, and full of energy, like a little city built for kids to explore.

Tonight, what stood out most was the staff. Ms. Alison and Ms. Dea were simply wonderful. Ms. Alison has a quiet, steady presence—making sure every child feels secure. Ms. Dea keeps things moving with warmth and enthusiasm. They don’t just watch over the kids but genuinely care.

It’s clear this isn’t just a job for them. It shows in the small things: a patient answer, a kind word, a quick moment of help when no one’s looking.

We left feeling grateful, and already looking forward to our next visit.

Review: I am NEVER going back here and save yourself and go to the free play area by build a bear or upstairs where they have rides across the forever 21. Today an uncoordinated party host gave her party the same bands as open play and I know because her family member sat next to me when she cut their orange bands off and put a blue one, she only worried about them. Anyways my daughter goes into her party and I run to get my daughter out but party dad says it’s fine she can stay but I know they charge per child at this place so I was gonna take my daughter out but ran out quickly to get my wallet and ran back and I encounter this party host frantically coming out the room with my daughter IN HER ARMS - with my daughter SCREAMING and I’m like ah uh what you’re not gonna do because I was gonna tell her what made her think it was okay to pick up my 3 yr old?? She should have came out to see if a parent was looking for their child because I was instead of making my child think she was being kidnapped and making her PANIC. Then some blonde girl comes to interfere who ALSO has the nastiest attitude because my son and 3 boys were playing and she goes “AH UH GET OUT THAT SECTION ITS FOR 1-2 year olds and you guys know you’re no where near that age” just rude to some 5-6 year olds like they’re not the reason she’s getting a pay check and has a job. Then the manager who btw looked like she had just came from the pool bc she was in beach wear came to give me new bands after the party host kept dragging the situation between us to her and said “don’t get your kids kidnapped” like WHO SAYS THAT. Then this place is also dirty because my daughter put a dirty piece of balloon in her mouth I know had been there for days because the other balloons looked like they barely had air left. The girl sitting by the door to enter was unbothered doing the bare minimum. Only person who’s really sweet is this one girl in the front.

Today they even put out treats and did a special bubble show party for dads and their children on the dance floor for Father’s Day. This is such a different interaction and environment than other playgrounds, the care and attention to detail is always spot on! We love the Jolly Yolly Team!

Review: We had an amazing experience at Jolly Yolly Kids Bethesda for my niece’s birthday party! The play area was clean, well-maintained, and perfect for kids to enjoy. A special shoutout to Allison, who went above and beyond to make sure everything in our party room ran smoothly. She was always on top of things, incredibly helpful, and made sure we had everything we needed. Her attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile truly made a difference. Thank you, Allison, for making our celebration stress-free and enjoyable! We highly recommend Jolly Yolly Kids for a fun and hassle-free party experience.

Review: Paid indoor amusement facilities, the whole environment inside is bright and clean, house/wood and sand area/air cushion slide, etc., I think they are all great, children also have a lot of fun, two larger slide facilities can also let adults take children to climb and play. Business is pretty good, at least 4.5 groups of families bring their children to play. However, the orange tube slide is very problematic in design. After sliding down with my 4-year-old granddaughter in my arms, I was still dizzy and didn't know what I hit and fell down. In addition to the bruises on the left knee, the right armpit near the chest was so painful that I couldn't breathe due to the impact. My granddaughter's right foot was also hit and she said it hurt (fortunately I was holding her in my arms) We sat on the mat and rested for a long time before standing up and walking away ☹️ After chatting with my niece, I found out why she stayed at the counter for so long when she entered. It turned out that she signed again (this was not their first visit): If you get injured while playing indoors, you will be responsible for it yourself. I hope the boss or teachers can personally play this (orange long tube slide) amusement facility a few more times, strictly confirm the safety of every child when playing, and strictly control the professional ethics and safety measures at any place in this room, so as to implement the original intention and good intention of the boss to operate this children's playground 20241219

My two kids absolutely love it and if they had it their way we’d spend the entire day here.
Loads of toys to play with and activities to do!
Refreshments are for sale but honestly, we just stop off at Starbucks for an after play snack/coffee for Mommy and Daddy 😝
The only reason I gave it a 4 star vs 5 star is PRICE.
$17-$20 per child plus $5 for any additional adults is a bit expensive. Otherwise this place is great

Review: Highly recommend Kids Ground! My 3 and 5 year old love coming here. There is plenty of space to run and climb without being overwhelming like some other indoor playgrounds. My daughter loved the craft/ drawing space as well. The bouncer house was also a favorite. At $17 per child it’s reasonably priced as well. My ultimate favorite thing about this business is that it’s family owned. The owner donated a few hours in her space to be used for facilitating social emotional development in preschoolers with disabilities within MCPS which really shows her commitment to the community and to philanthropy. I hope everyone comes here to support such a fun place which is owned by such a kind family!

Review: I never usually write negative reviews but I have to say something. First of all, it is such a lovely place that is very clean and plenty of toys to play with. I had such a good time with with my 1 and 2 year old that I bought a 3 month pass BUT this place misrepresented and purposefully led me to believe that this pass was for 3 months when instead it was for 5 visits. I would have no problem buying the 5 visit option (in fact I would have been able to plan my visits better) instead I had to again pay the entrance fee (because who is saying no to two toddlers right at the door when we drove 30min to get there?!) it was very frustrating and the front desk attendant was pretty condescending and rude in her interaction with me regarding this exchange. Needless to say, I’m not coming back. I’m annoyed that I was mislead. I encourage you to ask ALL the questions before you buy.

Review: I recently visited Kids Ground, and while the play structures were sturdy, clean, and loads of fun, there were a few concerns that I couldn't ignore. Both play areas were well-maintained and provided an enjoyable experience for the kids. However, the floors throughout the facility left much to be desired in terms of safety as the “padded” areas are raised AND not secure. My toddler tripped several times, it's also concerning that there was no padding on the walls in the area with the “wooden chips”, which could be a potential hazard.

One particular area with ""wooden chips"" lacked floor padding, which struck me as odd. Additionally, there was a sign warning against allowing children to throw the wooden chips outside of the designated section, which somewhat limited the play possibilities.

Cleanliness was another issue that raised questions for me. While the play structures appeared clean, I had reservations about the overall cleanliness of the facility. Kids were required to remove their shoes, which is great, but the same rule didn't apply to adults. It can be quite unhygienic to wear shoes indoors, and this policy seemed inconsistent.

On the positive side, the staff at Kids Ground was friendly and accommodating, and they had refreshments for purchase. This added a touch of convenience to the visit. In summary, while Kids Ground has its merits, the safety and cleanliness concerns need attention to make it an ideal indoor playground for families.

A lot of other kids playgrounds are really big and offer things for a large range of kids, which doesn't always feel safe for little ones. Here, the play structures and spaces are geared towards tots and young children so they can make new friends their age :) The owner and staff are very friendly, and there are always healthy and yummy snack options!

No available street parking, no available garage parking (there's only one limited section for the retail parking). What a nightmare! Especially for a place that is intended for young children. When I came out there were 4 double parked cars trying to get young children into Kids Ground. Very unsafe and seems to be a serious issue. I wish this business and other businesses on this street made sure they have adequate parking for their customers.

I highly recommend going in the morning if you can, it's much less busy. And if you can, make sure to help put things back where they belong if your kid removes it from an area! I try to, and my kid helps too. The staff noticed and gave my little helper a free snack 🥰

Review: I’m sharing this info so others don’t face the same unfortunate fate as me. I was exploring venues for my daughter’s birthday and called Kids Ground to inquire about date and time availability.  The employee I spoke to said the deposit was refundable up until 10 days before the day of the event. I remember this explicitly because I said let me talk to my husband and get back to you. Since I was under the impression I could cancel without penalty, I went ahead with the deposit, as I still needed to check the date/time with out of town guests.

Then, once I paid the deposit, I received an email confirmation that stated the deposit is non-refundable. I called Kids Ground three times and was bounced around from one staff member to another (apparently none of them could address my question about why they weren’t honoring what was told to me on the phone). I finally received an email from the same person who I had made the booking with - her memory failed her because she couldn’t recall our phone conversation and the fact that she told me the deposit was refundable up until 10 days before the event.

Hope they learn better customer service. I won’t be taking my kids here ever again.

In response to the business' response below: 1) The 2 staff members said they would get back to me about why I was the deposit was refundable and I never heard from either until a couple days later when the original employee I dealt with emailed me 2) I did not send back an email to the confirmation email. I responded to the waiver form email to acknowledge receipt of the form. For the record, Kids Ground signed the waiver for me. Maybe the employee I dealt with was new? Better and consistent training should be implemented to ensure that all employees know accurate policies so they can accurately address customer inquiries.

Review: It is a great place for toddlers (ages 9 months to 6 years). It is smaller than similar nearby locations (omnifun) and more expensive because they only do a punch pass style option. But it is nice for watching multiple toddlers because the layout has great visibility. It will be boring for kids over age 6 (maybe 5 even) as the climbing section is small. If you have younger kids it will be great.

Review: Great play space for young kids and especially great if you have two kids of slightly different ages. This was great for my 4 year old and 18 month old with the separate play spaces. The area isn’t cramped but you can feasibly keep an eye on two at once. The other nice feature is that kidsground allows full venue rentals for parties.

Review: My 20 month old loves spending time here. The staff is very friendly and place has lots to do. I think the daily price is a little pricey as they charge child and adult but the memberships seem reasonable if you plan to frequent the place as we do. I’ve tried other places with cheaper fee but the cleanliness and set up of this place is worth the price for us.

Review: My son was almost 2yo when we booked a 2hr spot here.  He LOVED it!  He couldn’t get enough of climbing and sliding and he especially loved the balloon pit.  It was really an amazing place to have to ourselves for a couple of hours.  The price is super reasonable and I felt like they did a really good job keeping it clean and adhering to COVID-19 precautions.  Definitely would return!

Review: My kids are 2.5 and 4 years old and they absolutely loved this place. They could climb, slide, jump in ball pits, color, play with magnets, build with blocks, ""cook"" food in the play kitchens, and dig at the wood block beach. They sell snacks and drinks but don't seem to object to people bringing outside food. The facilities were clean and the staff members were all friendly and helpful. It's a great option for especially cold or hot days.  The girls both asked if we could come back; we definitely will!

Review: Newest indoor play center in town. This is must go place if you have kids under 7. They have nice and big play structure where kids can climb, walk and slide and they also have small play areas where kids can play with toys, games, bricks..etc. They have separate rooms for birthday parties and classes which is worth to try. Overall, my impression about Kids Ground is very clean, fun and friendly, so I will definitely come back.

Great place, we trade of between here and kids jungle land in white Marsh. Because the entire ceiling and walls of KidzVille is black and I find it dark and claustrophobic, and there is no where for normal adults to sit comfortably, I  personally prefer kids jungle land which is much more spacious and bright  and has better running and climbing opportunities. They both have great things to do .

Review: Kidzville with the boys last night in Perry Hall!  I was pleasantly surprised how cool the place is and they didn’t try to upcharge everything.  There weren’t any arcade games which I loved.  No tickets to win and cash in for some unnecessary junk. I think admission was 13.99 and you need slipper socks.  They were $2.95 so very reasonable.  It was a big indoor playground with lots of stuff for the kids to do. Perfrct for a rainy night.

The only food they sold was cheese or pepperoni pizza.  You had to buy a whole pizza.  $18 for a 16 inch cheese which was reasonable.  The pizza was also really good.

In addition to the pizzas they had a freezer of ice creams.  They also had water, juice, sodas and coffee pods.  Waters were $2 and juice was $2.50.  Thats all they had which was perfect.  They didn’t even sell candy. Prices were very reasonable!

The boys were exhausted when we left there.

I will definitely go back.

Unfortunately they do not allow you to bring your own food and the food they sell is full of sugar , food coloring, salt and unhealthy options. This is a problem if your child is not used to unhealthy food.

Review: Not a fault to be found in terms of play and recreation. It's a great size and keeps the children very busy.

Up front at the registers, there's an ice cream freezer & small refrigerator with bottled water and juice boxes for purchase. Pizzas are also ordered at the register and sold by the pie.

No-slip shoes are available to put on for the bathroom (so that you don't walk in there with just your socks). There's a very long wall of cubbies heading into the play area, in order to put your shoes & belongings up.

I explained nicely about her and she said I don't care. so i replied please watch your kid and mind your business, the kids have been playing and the staff saw her and no one told us anything i told here the kids is sneezing coughing and most of them are sick with no mask and were eating and then play without even washing hands. Here is the problem she didn't like that we are muslims and because one of the staff was the same race and from the same country and they talked their language, the staff member came to me and asked me to leave in a very rude way. I was shocked about her attitude and being in her side because of the same race and country and i asked her for a manager or customer service number she said oh here is the number do what you want. I paid 97 $ for 4 kids for 45 min I tried reaching the corporate number but i didn't get it Please share as much as you can and try to let whoever is the manager or the owner is to know

We've been to similar places in the past that had softer/quieter music or no music at all and the kids still had an amazing time. If you want to improve parent's experience, please consider lowering the music. Also, better food/coffee options would be great.

I didn't like that perhaps the playroom wasn't as clean as it has been in the past as clumps of hair was always clinging to our socks, despite pulling it off numerous times. I would recommend that socks be removed when kids climb on any of the apparatuses that have round, smooth rungs. Too much of a slipping hazard!

Review: I attended a 5 year old’s birthday party with my 3 children, one of whom is 11 months old and requires a high chair. I asked the front desk if they had any high chairs, to which they told the party host it would be another $12.99 “add-on”. Considering they had already paid almost $500 to rent the space plus $200 in pizza, I didn’t want to burden them with another unreasonable fee. Literally every restaurant in the world has high chairs available for free, so charging a “rental fee” is unreasonable.

The website for We Rock The Spectrum says that you get 2 hours, but in reality you only get 1 hour of play time plus 1 hour for pizza/cake. In reality, this was a late afternoon party and most of the kids were done eating fairly quickly (or had already had lunch and weren’t hungry) and could’ve continued playing, but the staff did not hesitate to corral us into the small party room and tell the kids they wouldn’t be returning to the play area.

Overall this place is very disappointing if you’re attending or hosting a birthday party.

Lots to do and a great way to get your children active through a variety of play options- swings, toys, creative play, jumping, climbing, zip line, and more.

Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me. Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially a mom that needs to get out and socialize. Food is delicious!

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

Review: It's an awesome place in town for the kids. There are plenty of things to do for all ages and nicely arranged for space for the kids. Every time we've been, it is very clean. Everyone working there is so friendly and nice, and they do whatever they can do to help you, always with a smile, have a great time, and feel comfortable. My grandson's birthday was there this past week, and everyone had a great time. They made his birthday special. Thank you Cabin Fever!!! I  definitely recommend them!

Review: Our favorite place to go when the weather was hot, cold, rainy, snowy, overcast, sunny, or cloudy. We moved last month and my daughter still talks about it daily. So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Review: Good idea for a small country town, although $12 admission for a nine month old baby is pretty steep. It's like a indoor playground with a steep slide.. Your better off driving to Salisbury going to sky zone getting your money's worth if you don't have a car and just want the kids to burn energy when it's cold outside go here.

Review: I held my daughters 3rd birthday here today. Me and my family have been here one other time, and were completely SOLD. Today just sealed the deal! Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: We have been going to Hyperkids (Derwood/ Rockville location) since it opened December 2024 at least twice a month and I can say that the facility is spacious and the mazes are challenging enough for my 4 year old. They do their best in keeping the place clean and equipment is well maintained overall but there is one part of the maze where the lights have been never replaced since the lights went out maybe around February 2025 keeping that corner dark. The staff go around making sure that the place is clean. Same goes with their restrooms.
The only critique I have is that the staff don't check that the wristbands of the parent and child match, thus not giving me the assurance of safety. Although I know as a parent this is primarily my job but with a place this big it could be hard to keep track of your child.
I would still recommend this place for it's cleanliness and my son has so much fun playing here and never gets bored.

Review: We have been regulars at Totsville for some time now and it is a great place to take the kids! The price is cost effective and you get your money’s worth with the amount of time you can spend and the experience for your little ones. The place is clean and often workers are walking around vacuuming which is nice to see! The sand pit is a super plus and keeps the children entertained for hours. The play structure is also engaging and inviting for the children. There is a separate space for younger children which is nice to have for the little ones. It is never overly crowded and is the perfect way to engage in play!

Review: My 2.5-year-old loved it. It was large enough for him to navigate independently while remaining visible to me during play. Like most play gyms, it smells like a gym, and the bathrooms weren’t as inviting as they could have been. However, overall, the play fixtures and sandbox were a hit with my little one. We’ll be back.

Apparently I was wrong I am amending my previous review. Upon our most recent visit, there is now the playground police at Totsville. ""Don't touch this, don't touch that."" If you don't want children touching something maybe don't put it at an indoor playground. An employee grabbed a toy from my toddler but did absolutely nothing when another larger child hit my 18 month old. I don't think we will be returning, no matter how clean the facility is.

No worries being inside, as I watched it raining ! The Staff made sure everyone was having a great time, too !

It was so refreshing because you have so many adults fast to approach a child and he didn't, he approached the parent as needed and was very sweet about it. I seen another young lady vacuuming keeping the area clean for the little ones. It was really fun and we didn't want to leave. We will definitely be back💗💖 Thank you totsville.

Review: Our grandson had a 3 year old birthday party here.  The experience was great. All of the children enjoyed the play area and the separate sand area.  The place is very well kept. Clean and in order. The staff was wonderful.  They were always around making sure everything was OK or if we needed anything.  The separate food / party room was well maintained and clean. The pizza that was a part of the party package was very good.
Have your party here or just bring your children here for a great day out of playtime.

Review: Kiddo loved the big sandbox and all the toys in it! She's 2, so particularly I liked the *idea* of the area by just for smaller kiddos. But the one downside was there was no real enforcement of that, so as the morning went on and more kiddos showed up, there was a group of bigger kids sprinting around, including in that area, as I saw more than one kid (including her) get knocked down by them not paying attention (and unfortunately their grownups didn't seem to be paying much attention, either, to helping direct them to better areas to run around/reminding them to be careful of others).

Review: We really enjoyed this place. I have an almost 2 year old who loves to climb and let loose. I liked this place because it’s built for kids under 8 only. Its climbing areas are only 1 story tall so it’s easy to spot your child from the ground. They have great slides, ball pits, a giant sandbox and some really cool tubes. One thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness. The floor was spotless. The staff were courteous, there was even a coffee machine, not that we used it. They also had an area where they can climb a wall, build blocks, etc. It was crowded but not so much that he couldn’t enjoy himself and I didn’t lose track of him. They also had a bubble machine which was kind of cool to see go off every once in a while. I think we would definitely go back to this place.

The facility was not too crowded, even though we were there on a holiday, and everyone was so kind.

Review: Save yourself the time and disgust and keep your children away from Totsville Indoor Playground in Glen Burnie. The entire place completely reeks of urine and you can literally feel the moisture from the grimey carpet on your feet. The equipment was broken and obviously dirty. $30 and we only lasted 20 minutes due to the smell and overall condition of the place. Today was the first time I went in years and it will definitely be my last.

Review: This gym has become our go-to indoor gym. The staff is great and the gym has so many different activities that we discover something new to try every time. One of my kids has been coming since he was 18 months old and every time he's had a blast so this gym is great for the new walkers and up. My older kid is on the spectrum, and this was the one place he could go, not be overwhelmed and have tons to do. So many places are pretend play focused and it didn't work for him. We did a birthday party here and all the kids and parents said that they had a great time.

Review: I did research around 2 months before my daughter's 4th birthday because she said she wanted to celebrate with both family and friends. I love celebrating my daughter so we went to a bunch of places near our area, and decided on We Rock the Spectrum Gaithersburg. It's not the first time I've had an event at a play gym, so I kind of knew what to expect. I met Pam when we came to visit, and she was also there to welcome me when I came to drop off decorations on the event date. I never do things half way, so if I plan a party, I'll do it in my style. I wanted to decorate it myself and since the room was free, she let me in and said I could set up. The party was a success. All the kids had a blast! We had the whole area for 2 hours, 4-6pm, the time flew and around 5:40pm, I asked Pam if I could extend time, an hour or 30 min. I felt Kristina was rude in telling me it would be $175 for an extra hour and she was clearly annoyed. I looked over at Pam and tried asking, but we left it at an extra 30 minutes for $75. The party for the kids was great, but I left feeling a certain way. Kristina had charged me $500 for the room (which is now $600), $75 for an extra 30 minutes, and $30 for hanging some items. They ordered the food for us and the pizza box had a receipt charge of $137.24, but she charged me $185 for the food. It felt very nickel and dime. I didn't leave feeling that good considering the party went well, because of this and how she acted that day. I paid $75 for an extra 30 minutes til 6:30pm, and at 6:20pm, she started yelling ""5 more minutes!."" It could have been better, and when my husband asked me why the food was more expensive than it should have been, I called Pam to ask and shared my feelings. She apologized and explained Kristina was having a bad day and refunded to me the tip I left of $50. The space is very good for kids, the service we got could have been a lot better. I was going to leave 3 stars, but she may have been just having a bad day. The space and zipline is awesome for a kids birthday party!

Review: Kristina the owner was very rude. She lacked kindness and respect. I parked at their reserved spot around 8:15 pm way after business hours and she asked me to move my car very rudely and continued to berate me as I was standing outside ready to move my car. I understood I was in the wrong I had no problem moving my car but there was no need for her to be so rude and unkind. Please treat people with kindness and respect.
Edit to owners response:
I completely understand and if I would have seen the place was operating I would have absolutely not parked there. The place was clearly closed and all lights were off. The problem is the way Kristina handled the situation and how disrespectful she was.
Edit to Liza’s response:
I never said I wasn’t in the wrong. I already stated I had no problem moving my car because I understood Kristina completely. My first impression of Kristina was straight unkindness and rudeness. I’m sure she has a wonderful side to her but she did not approach me or talk to me with kindness. I left 1 review about her actions towards me and now I have to respond to 2 reviews within a couple hours. Kristina can have her morals while being kind and respectful. I don’t have to continue explaining myself, Kristina knows how she treated me and that there was no need for her to react that way towards me. I hope nothing but the best for Kristina, just remember to treat people the way you would like to be treated.

We had kids aged 1-8 and they all had plenty to keep them entertained. The mirrors and layout of the rooms make it easy to keep an eye on your kid without hovering, which was especially great for us as we had a 2 year old who loved the make believe play area while our 5 year old loved the zip line and trampoline.

Review: All the positive reviews are spot on - this is an ideal place for a birthday party! As the name suggests, it is a welcoming place for kids of all abilities and needs, which I love - but honestly we just went because it's a great place for any kid to have a party. We found it based on word of mouth from other local parents on Facebook and I can see why everyone loves it. We had my 7-year-old's party here but I will come back for my younger kid's party at some point too, maybe multiple times :)  One thing I love is how there is stuff for younger siblings too (my 3y/o loved it). The owners Pam and Kristina take care of everything so it is super low stress - we brought in cake, drinks, and goodie bags, and they handled everything (helped us bring stuff in, did set-up, handled trash, they even cut and serve the pizza and cake).  Oh and even ordering the pizza. Having seemingly little stuff like that off your plate is so nice. For $35 they put up themed decorations and that was worth it.  I had considered a couple other play places (which are great) but I knew they were just going to be too big, loud, and overwhelming for me and my toddler, whereas this was perfect and all kids and parents were happy!  Oh and it is CLEAN which is always appreciated, including two easy bathrooms right there with a big changing area for folks with littles. They were very thoughtful in creating this place.

The rates were incredibly reasonable and we had the whole place to ourselves for the kiddos to run and play together. Pam and Kristina were amazing! Scheduling and communication prior to the party was 10/10. They arranged the pizza delivery, helped serve food, and even helped us package up the leftovers. Having an extra set of hands to help serve food was priceless. And at the end of the party they assured us they would handle all of the clean up! Everything was clean, well organized, and FUN! Our party had kids from 18 months to 8 and they all had the time of their lives. There is truly something for all ages.

Review: We blindly booked a party slot for our sons 4 year old birthday at We Rock the Spectrum purely based on others reviews as we didn’t have a chance to visit and we were so pleasantly happy with our experience there. Unlike other venues, when you book a party, it’s automatically private, no up charge for this. The owners are lovely and were always prompt to respond to any question leading up to our event. They basically set up and cleaned up everything for us which helped my husband and I be able to mingle and keep an eye on our birthday boy and guests more than we would’ve anywhere else. The play areas were so clean and so much to do for kids of all ages! We had kids as young as one all the way up to 7 year olds and they all were occupied for the full two hours.

We can’t wait to return for a normal play day because our kids had so much fun!

Review: Had my son's 4th birthday here and it was absolutely wonderful. At first I wasn't sure if the gym and party room would be enough space for 18 kids plus 10 parents, but it was perfect and all the kids had a blast (ages 1 - 8). There is a little bit of everything for all ages. I would 100% recommend for winter birthdays and the $35 set up fee is worth it. Pam and Kristina were amazing! Would definitely consider having my 3 year old's birthday here too.

Review: I have too many good things to say about WRTS Gaithersburg. The owners, Kristina and Pam couldn't be nicer and more helpful. I've taken my 4 year old to WRTS several times before, but today we had his birthday party there and it was AMAZING. I drive all the way from Northern Virginia (about an hour) to get to WRTS because it is that amazing. All partygoers raved about the venue and will definitely be going back. My son is Autistic and was having a bit of a meltdown and Pam and Kristina were abundantly accommodating, offering me noise cancelling headphones for my son, a quiet place to sit and calm down, toys, snacks, anything and everything. They are professional business owners and wonderful people who care genuinely about children and especially those with special needs. I wish I could give them 10 stars!

I was worried two hours would be short, turns out it’s more than enough for a kids party! We’ll be going back for free play soon :)

Review: This is a small place for younger kids, probably below the age of 7. I got there with my kid and we thought it was probably not a fit, so I asked if we could take a look. They said no. Pay first. So we paid $18, went in and confirmed it wasn't a fit. Don't waste your $18 if you have a kid over 8/9. Try a bigger bounce park.

Review: We had our daughter's 2nd birthday party at We Rock the Spectrum and had a wonderful experience. The price was very fair for a private party, and the facility was very clean and organized upon our arrival. Our guests ranged from ages 18 months to 11 years old, and there was something for everyone to enjoy. There was plenty of space for kids and parents to spread out. Kristina and her mom were awesome about helping with set up, serving during lunch, and clean up. This really allowed me and my husband to focus on our guests, and our daughter having fun on her birthday.  Our friends told us how much their kids enjoyed the party and how they all want to go back again to play. I highly recommend for a birthday party!

Review: I saw this place on Instagram (technically another location ) but searched and found the location in Gaithersburg open on the day we wanted to go.  This place is a hidden gem.  This is a place for ALL kids to feel included. The gym has various equipment for sensory processing like climbing structures, various swings, trampoline, and zip line. It has a play area with toys and arts&crafts area. There is also a  rock climbing wall. My son played here for HOURS. He loved it.

What I loved as a parent is that it wasn’t packed crowded like so many other kids play places. Unlike some kids gyms, you don’t have to pay a monthly membership and can come to open gym. Monthly memberships and play packages are available if you want. It’s also very clean!  We were there in a Sunday afternoon and were mostly just my son and 1-2 other kids the whole time. Started to get busy as we left.

The only downside is they have a toy store. I understand they have to have additional revenue streams but it’s hard as a parent to deal with a small child whining about wanting a toy. Just be prepared!

Be sure to check their Facebook page for open gym hours as they do close for private birthday parties.

Review: We Rock The Spectrum is a great place for all community members to bring their kids to get out some energy. It’s also a great place for kids of all stages of development to play with peers of different abilities and different backgrounds and learn from each other.

We love taking our toddler here. The activities are educational and instructive and it wears our kid out every time.

Try it out on a rainy day like we did at first and you’ll be back again.

Staff was very informative and communicative. They helped me figure out what to get, allowed me to bring decorations and some food ahead of time, and had everything set up by the time we got there for the party. They also helped me with the timing of everything.
Kids had a BLAST running around and jumping. The place is so much fun and several of us adults wanted to join in as well!
The party room is pretty small, but we were barely there. There isn't a stove/oven, but there is a microwave and a full size fridge, and they offer pizza deals.
We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and other parents commented about using the storage in the future as well.
Highly recommend!

Review: What a wonderful place to visit. The owners have taken time to actually provide what is necessary for kids on the spectrum. When you walk in, it'll look like there aren't many toys but for kids on the spectrum, it's like sensory heaven. From multiple swings to either activate or calm the mind to a giant trampoline that encourages kids to interact when jumping together and then there's a sensory slide alongside a regular slide.

They also have a calming room and a study room. For some kids on the spectrum, the ability to go on a swing or jump on a giant trampoline between study breaks can make the biggest difference in how they learn.

The owners clearly thought everything through the I highly recommend going out and supporting this small business.

Review: I have a very, very active 1.5 year old. I live in Frederick and have gone to and liked both me lands in Frederick and gaithersburg. But this place was the best for my little guy. With all the kids being so much smaller and the play areas being smaller to match them, it felt more safe and accessible. He was more free to run up to whatever he wanted to do. The place was clean and cute. And the trampolines were a huge hit. He played for 3 hours and then slept more than he ever has overnight in his life. It's 40 min away from me and more expensive than me land, but I'll be back plenty.

Review: Like a similar reviewer, we unfortunately had a bad experience today with my 2 year old.  While the place is clean and front staff very nice, there is no supervision in the main play area.  My little guy had a ball thrown at his head and was pushed down stairs.  Either they should actively supervise the play area, or set up specific toddler times so little ones don't get hurt.  Disappointed

Review: This place is consistently CLEAN, especially compared to other indoor playgrounds. And it's the only place where I feel comfortable bringing my toddler because the age limit is 7 (so no ""big kids"" possibly trampling over my little one). They have classes and character meet & greets (Easter Bunny, Cocomelon, etc.) That are a great deal because after the craft or activity, kids get to stay and play. Highly recommend!

Review: TL;DR: They REALLY need to invest in a staff member to just supervise the play area to ensure kids are following the rules.

We have been coming there for about a year, but I don’t think we will be back unless things change. While the place is always clean, there are tons of play structures and toys, the front staff is always nice, and everything is padded, there are some significant concerns that will keep us from returning. Unfortunately, every time we have been there (we have gone 7+ times and have a membership) we have had to leave because of older children behaving unsafely and not following the rules. In general, parents largely don’t supervise their children here, and seem not to care if they follow the rules or behave safely. This isn’t an isolated incident but a trend. Parents/guardians sit in the sitting area on phones and laptops neglecting to supervise their kids, I suppose they figure it’s all padded and closed in so why bother? Since the playground is open birth-age 7, this creates a really unsafe environment for the younger kids. When my son was 18 months old, he was pushed down the flight of stairs here (luckily it’s padded) which resulted in an emergency visit later that night. Today the older kids were throwing the sit-on balls at each other and playing a game that involved swinging them around and whacking each other at full force and full speed. It’s something like this every single time we’ve come. Imagine recess but with no recess monitor. I understand that the model here is like that of an outdoor playground without paid supervision, but the way that it is enclosed seems to motivate parents to pay less attention to their kids since they can’t really wonder off. I’m not suggesting full provided care, just someone on staff to make sure people actually follow the rules inside.

I’m disappointed that we won’t be able to come back, because my son loves it, but it really isn’t safe for the little ones with older kids able to do anything they want regardless of rules or safety.

It was fun and we noticed how much effort the owner and staffs put into to keep this place sanitized, they wipe common surfaces often and clean the kids chair after each use by using Lysol wipes. The birthday party package come with one large pizza and we ordered another pizza, they were great! We were also allowed to bring local Seafood Legend catered stir fried noodles and that brings variety and our guests kept complimenting on how delicious the noodles were!  We had wonderful experience to celebrate our sweetheart’s birthday, thanks to Bubala Eldersburg, we shall come back for more fun :)

Review: I thought it was a great looking indoor place, very clean and my child enjoyed it. I am taking away 2 stars because I felt like it wasn’t as safe in terms of Covid precautions as some of the others we’ve been to. The number of kids is limited, but I felt like there were more adults than kids congregating to socialize at this place. None were masked. I think I was the only adult who was respectful enough of others to wear a mask indoors. The person up front was also not masked. Otherwise we had a great time, but at least for the time being we will patronize other places.

The manager and her family are so helpful and sweet and they make the party experience really fun and stress free.  Bubala is always clean and not overly crowded like some of the other places we have visited (check their Facebook page if you visit at peak times on Saturday or Sunday because they will pause admission once they reach capacity which is great).  I highly recommend this indoor playground!

The play area and party area was VERY clean. You could smell how fresh the place was as soon as you walked through the door. I was a little skeptical about the driving distance versus the one one reisterstown road but it was well worth the drive. This locations play area is 3 times bigger than the other one. Every child at the party was crying when it was time to leave. We will definitely be back and the pizza was so so delicious 😍

Review: This place here is very fun and exciting the the toddlers. My son which is 4 ran for hours and had a blast, we were there about 3 hours probably would have stayed until closing but he hurt himself. The price is awesome and very affordable to have fun on a budget and no time limit as well I believe that is the really fun part to so you don’t have to have crying toddlers having to leave when they aren’t ready too. I drove 50 min away to come to this location pikesville is 10 min closer but by the pictures with the plane it was what he wanted and glad I did was told this location was the biggest and the newest. Wish they would come start on closer to the Baltimore county side by white marsh or Dundalk or somewhere closer to these areas so I wouldn’t be that long of a drive. But I can promise you we will do the drive again cuz he loved it probably would have been better if he had kids to play with besides mommy but we had fun.

I will tell the location is ducked off you will not find it without gps and you won’t find it typing the name into maps you have to put the address. But no matter where you come from it won’t be a waste of a drive, it was very clean, the staff was friendly and with COVID it probably hurt there business people should help them out so they don’t close with such a lovely business. I will try to get the word around for this beautiful toddler place. Oh lastly the pricing it is 13 for 1 kid, 11 per kid for 2 siblings, 10 per kid for 3 siblings, and if you have a group of 10 kids a minimum don’t remember the price just know it was reasonable, they also have memberships that never expire and can use it any location.

Review: BeeZee Sensory Gym is a game-changer for children of all abilities, especially those with autism. The facility is thoughtfully designed with a variety of sensory-rich equipment—swings, climbing walls, crash pads, and tactile boards—that cater to diverse sensory needs. The staff are compassionate, well-trained, and attentive, creating a safe and welcoming environment where kids feel free to explore and engage.

The space is clean, brightly lit, and organized, with clear zones for high-energy play and calming activities.

Overall, this sensory gym is a haven for children to grow, play, and develop at their own pace. It’s a must-visit for families seeking an enjoyable, and supportive environment. We will be recommending this place for our kiddos!

Review: I can’t say enough wonderful things about BeeZee sensory gym! From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed into a bright, clean, and thoughtfully designed sensory rich environment that immediately put both my children and me at ease. Every corner of the space is intentionally crafted to support sensory development, motor skills, and emotional regulation — and it shows!

If you're searching for a nurturing space where your child can play freely, have a blast, and get their sensory needs met in the most joyful way — this gym is the place! Highly recommend!

This place needs a major overhaul or update . Loose. Ceiling tiles about to fall and the floor piano did work . Also it was very dark no lights on .

Review: I recently took my daughter to the Pikesville Bubala Indoor Playground location at 3:50 p.m. The sign on the door said 10-5 p.m. It appeared to be closed as the lights were partially off, however, the door was open. We went inside only to find the employee hidden in one of the play areas with her tablet and it appeared she had been napping. When she saw us she got up and said they were closing because there were no customers. I stated that the hours listed said until 5 p.m. but the employee insisted that she was closing. I asked he if my daughter could play for the remaining of the time left and the employee said no. My daughter was visibly upset, and at that point, it wasn’t worth the argument, the employee had clearly decided to close, regardless of the fact that we were paying customers. It’s disappointing to see this location not being cared for, especially since it’s the closest indoor playground in the Pikesville area geared toward younger children.

I truly hope the owner takes the time to reevaluate the customer service standards and considers hiring staff who are genuinely committed to creating a positive experience for families, rather than simply showing up for a paycheck. Perhaps the owner would consider selling to someone who lives in the community and has a genuine passion for revitalizing this Bubala location, bringing it back to what it once was, or even making it better. This place has so much potential, and it would be a shame to see it close down permanently.

Review: We hosted our daughters 3rd birthday party here and although the children had fun in the play area, we won’t be returning for two important reasons:

1) The chairs provided for the children are hazardous because of their design, causing them to collapse under the toddlers weight and usually leading the kids to bang their faces or chins on the table in front of them. This happened to at least 7 children in our party and parents had to constantly catch their kids to prevent more of them from falling and crashing into the table when just trying to sit on the chairs. It sounds trivial but it’s a major safety issue that really worsened our party experience.

2) The equipment and interior is pretty run down and worn out. There’s just no way to not notice how worn and dirty everything is. Because you’re paying the same amount as having your party at a nicer and newer facility, I would not recommend hosting a kids party here since you really don’t get the value for what you’re paying for.

Review: I was disappointed with the state of this play area during my recent visit. Several areas were poorly lit, making it difficult to see properly, as if some lights were out. The play equipment appeared worn and in need of maintenance, raising safety concerns. Additionally, the cleanliness of the space was questionable, which is especially concerning in an area meant for children.

Review: I shared all of this including pictures in an email to the owner. But I wanted to be sure I share the experience here as well. I threw a party for my 4 yo son today at Bubala in Reisterstown.

The party room itself was extremely run down. The paint is peeling and the furniture is torn apart - I’ve attached photos. I understand this is a children’s play center but as someone who paid over $20 per child attending this party; my expectation was that the party room would look presentable and I wouldn’t need to figure out how to hide the things which were falling apart.

The chairs in the party room are a hazard for small children. We had at least 5 kids fall down while sitting and the chairs collapse in on them. The bottoms are plastic instead of rubber; this combined with the vinyl flooring made them a liability and very easy for kids to hurt themselves.

Lastly, the person working today…I was told I’d have a host to help me decorate. Thank goodness I had my parents meet me because I received no help. The person working was lackluster, at best. They didn’t inform me when the pizzas arrived. Multiple guests shared how unpleasant the person working was at check in. The most conversation I got was when they told me we needed to leave in 10 mins for another party coming in and when they were ready to take my payment.

The saving grace was that my son and the kids had fun in the play space. I wouldn't recommend paying for a party here unless the above it ratified.

Review: I had my daughter’s birthday party here and I can say the young lady that helped me was friendly however the place was not clean at all . The party room had stains all over the wall. The overhead didn’t work and they had it rolled up and there were missing paint spots on the wall as well as the party room had an odor to it. The floor was sticky and if the party room isn’t being cleaned I can only imagine if the play area gets sanitized.

Review: We had my daughter's second birthday party here and it was such a wonderful time. The staff is incredibly friendly and the place was clean. The playground is on the smaller side which actually makes it perfect for 2 and 3 year olds. The party room is a lovely blank canvas for decorating with plenty of space. The pizza was decent and came in hot right before lunchtime. They let you bring in cold food, deserts and drinks and they were so easy going. You have the party room 30min in advance to set up and then access to it for the entire 2hrs party. A great deal and a really lovely party space for the little ones.

My only complaints is, my daughter’s socks were beyond black, and the party room floor was sticky, which tells me the carpets and floors aren’t cleaned often, if at all. I wasn’t even willing to bring the socks home to put them in my washer. BUBULA, you have to do better, because this is a great place for the little ones to play.

Review: The place is beyond my expectations. Perfect inside toddler playground for a child's birthday party. Everything was clean and disinfected (before arriving and leaving). The setup in the party room was perfect. We had the entire place to ourselves. Great children's music (Gracie's Corner) was played throughout the place. My daughter loves gracies corner. The staff was amazing and helped with everything from carrying in items for the planned party, decorating the party room, helping assist with scheduled activities-pizza, cake cutting, etc. The staff also ensured everyone was having a great time and helping whenever anyone needed anything (very attentive). I see why they are number 1 with toddler party's. My daughter loved having her 3rd birthday party here. My guest stated how this place was the best place they have been to for a toddler's party-parking was easy, spacious, and very kid friendly. Definitely plan on visiting this location again in the future.

Review: I recently revisited Bubala's Indoor Playground over the weekend, and I must say, my recent experience only reinforced my positive impressions from my initial visit. However, I can't help but express my dissatisfaction with the deletion of my previous review, which praised Dreshawna, one of Bubala's stellar employees. Initially, I was disheartened to find my earlier accolades for Dreshawna's exceptional cleaning skills erased from the platform. Nevertheless, my disappointment turned to delight upon returning to the facility and discovering that she not only still works there but continues to exhibit the same level of excellence that initially impressed me. The dedication to maintaining a clean and hygienic environment at Bubala's is truly commendable. The indoor playground itself continues to be a fantastic space for children to explore and play. While I stand by my previous praise for Dreshawna, I hope this review remains intact to convey my satisfaction with her consistent performance. My only suggestion would be to ensure that customer reviews are treated with the importance they deserve, fostering a transparent and honest reflection of the establishment's strengths.

Review: Honest review! Read the reviews before you book a party, because I read the 1 star reviews, I avoided issues and had a wonderful time! My son had his 1st birthday there, perfect venue. We had soooo much fun.

I see people saying the staff is young & there’s no management on site, true! But I’m young too so I had a lot of fun with the staff lol. They legit just follow the rules to a T, if that bothers you idk what to tell you.

PAY THE EXTRA $100 TO BRING YOUR OWN FOOD! The pizza provided sucks lol. I don’t know *why* it costs more to bring food but it does.

The projector doesnt work. It’s there, but it’s not usable so don’t plan to use it.

You will get 30 mins to set up, so create all your decorations and organize them at home. Do your best! This is a children’s party not a wedding, the room is cute even without decor! I know we all love our kids but how much decorations does a kiddie party need?

WE HAD SO MUCH FUN! My son had fun, all the kids had fun & we made amazing memories. It is not a grandiose venue, but it’s affordable and fun. I still give it 5 stars & I might have his 2nd birthday party there too 🎉🥳

Review: My daughter just had her 2nd birthday party here. I booked a private party with and additional hour. I arrived to an empty facility at 3:15 (my party was scheduled for 4pm) was greeted by a young girl who advised that per management she was not allowed to let us in to doctorate until 3:30. That was strike one, during the party I ran out of plates and asked if I could get plates (which the facility provides for parties) and was advised because I brought my own decorations I could only be given 10 plates per management when I paid for a party for 25 kids (strike 2). When the pizza arrived it the establishment policy that we should feed 25 kids from one large pizza that is cut into tiny slices. I paid to have an extra hour on my party to be told that I would only have until 6:30 because it policy that the facility is clean and closed at 7pm. So at 6:30 the young ladies on staff began to clean over top of my guest! Which is totally unacceptable! So I’m essentially I did not get an extra hour, I paid for nothing. Although the staff is friendly they are merely children running a business. They blame everything on management, but there’s no management representation on site! When asked to have the manager number that request was denied! I low key want some of my money back! The place is cute for small children, but I would NEVER patronize this place again!

Review: Because this store is frequently closed and we were driving from downtown Baltimore, we called ahead today (7/25) about coming in and were told that they would stay open until 5pm. We arrived at 3:45 and the girl at the counter (AirPods in, talking on her phone) told us that they were closing early. We mentioned that we had called ahead and she said that due to low business volume the owner had said to close early. We asked if there was any way she could recontact the owner to stay open and she refused. We asked if my 4 year old could play for 10 minutes while she went about closing the shop (I dunno, closing the register and cleaning the bathroom perhaps?) and she refused. The additional overhead for 10-30 minutes of play would have been negligible, and my daughter’s disappointment was palpable. We intentionally don’t promise a trip to Bubala unless we confirm that they’re open for business, and this was poor customer service and frank laziness on this employee’s part. Sounds like it’s only Hyperkidz from now on.

Review: This is such a fun place - my kids had an absolute blast here TWICE this week and I was thrilled to be able to let them run and explore in a controlled, safe, and 💯 child friendly environment! There was a little school bus carousel that all the kids seemed to adore, a ball pit, slides into the ball pit and so much more! The young lady behind the front desk both times we went was so sweet and friendly, and she was always cleaning surfaces and keeping things tidy. Really happy with our time here - we were visiting for the week and I will be so sad that we won't be able to be back for a while. What a gem!

Review: This place is perfect to get your kids out of the house and active. Especially on a rainy or cold day when it's not exactly ideal to go to the playground. I have a 1 year old and after 30-45 minutes of crawling around and having fun, he was beat. Pretty sure I just figured out the secret to parenthood 😆

We went in the morning and had the whole place to ourselves! The staff was super friendly and take COVID precautions seriously. Can't wait to go back!

Review: My child enjoys this play place and I am looking forward to the new location opening. There is something for any age child under 7 I would personally say. The bathrooms are very clean and have a real changing table with a nice mat. I have not attended a party here, but peaking into the rooms I am impressed by the decoration packages they provide. The employees are all polite, and I appreciate that you are allowed to have outside food in the front seating area. Also there is no time limit so you can really get your moneys worth. This place is a godsend during the winter, and I would highly recommend it especially for young ones who are not yet very socialized due to the pandemic.

And the prices seem incredibly reasonable: less than $9 entry (1 kid and 2 adults) and way cheaper options for monthly passes.

I took a couple of panoramas to capture the cuteness (and the cleanness).

Review: Never and I say never ever go to kidz city in odenton. I booked a two hour play time. We rented out the entire building. Booking was not easy and lacking communication. This should have been a red flag! I was finally able to talk to a lady over the phone who sent me a link to pay. I was able to complete the booking online through the link.
About 30 minutes into our playtime it all started going down hill.
I was yelled at and completely disrespected by someone who claims to own the establishment. For what? I moved one of the seating sections to sit down and watch my kids play after a long day with my friends. There one was chair out on the floor and I had given that to my pregnant friend. I went over to grab some seating to bring it closer so I could chat with my friends and we could all still watch our kids play! When I started moving the seating he starts yelling at me from the front really aggressively. I had to walk over to him to even understand what he was yelling about. He started coming at my how it was against the rules to move it. I read everything, EVERYTHING, I sign. I read the rules. No where did I say I couldn’t move seating or I wouldn’t have done it. It was rude, disrespectful, and utterly embarrassing. Unfortunately I came back at him and got defensive and could have responded better myself. Not to make excuses but I had a really rough morning with work and was trying to just relax and enjoy watching my kids play in a indoor playground for the first time in a year and a half.

He continued to push it and was completely unprofessional. Full out screaming at me. He kept saying he had other chairs he could get me but instead of just getting the chair kept yelling at me until I raised my voice and told him to just get me the chair to sit instead of continuing to yell at me. It was gross. He got a chair and spent the rest of the time in the back office. we cleaned up and cleared out well before our time was over. I was buckling my kids in their car seat outside in my car when he then comes out and approaches me. He then starts asking for more money! I had paid online already. It was so shady feeling, he started taking pictures of me, my car, and my license plate and it was super weird. I informed him I paid through the link and obviously he saw that or we wouldn't have been let in to play in the first place. Weird and so shady. I will never ever come back. Beware. I posted in my moms group and apparently I'm not the only one who has been treated poorly. He wouldn't give his name but he stated he owned the place.

There’s basketball, a huge building blocks area, a town with interactive toys and games, a hockey area.... endless options. They offer different programs and have party rooms to so you can pick your theme and have an amazing big party for you kiddo. Different from any other kids place and not the typical stressful, overcrowded play place. Prices are great, too. A+. They do sell snacks and drinks as well and the staff goes out of their way to help.

Review: I have not been to this place; however, I feel the need to share my experience on the phone with them with everyone. After checking their website for pricing, I called to ask if outside food was allowed to be brought into the facility. The lady on the phone advised outside food is allowed. I then confirmed the price on Mondays is $11 per child, as per their website. The lady on the phone continued to explain ""Mondays are half off days, so the price per child on Mondays is $8"".... Excuse me, what?? How is half off of $11 $8??? Last time I checked half off of 11 was $5.50. The lady on the phone then became slightly irritated and rude. Needless to say, I will not be going to this facility if they are going to try to rip off their customers. What they really need to do is change their website to reflect Monday pricing as $16 and half off of 16 is indeed $8 but the website does not say that and I will post a picture to prove same.

Review: $16 entrance fee for this place is pretty steep for what they offer. It’s a cute space, and it’s clean, but there aren’t quite enough activities to make it worth the money. I would be much more inclined to return if the cost per child was closer to $10, even $12. I also think the little village should be spread out more throughout the space because as it started to get busier, it felt very crowded and overwhelming for my toddler because everyone was in a small space.  Unfortunately we will not be returning.

Review: I just had my son’s 2nd Birthday Party at Kidz City in Odenton Maryland and have never felt an urgent/strong need to write a review like this.  The best decision ever made.  I initially planned on having it in my community’s clubhouse as I only planned to have just a reception of food and not carry the burden of party planning.  But I somehow visited Kidz City and just knew that I wouldn’t have to worry about entertaining kids if I had it there.  Every child I saw leaving the location was crying to their parent to go back.  All I had to bring was some food, cake, and balloons.  THEY HANDLED EVERYTHING FOR ME! They even got Pizza for the kids.  As soon as my guests arrived, they immediately were playing around with their kids.  No burden of entertainment for me.  It’s like every parent of a toddler or big kid’s dream.   ALL THE KIDS AT THE PARTY (ages 7 months - 10yrs old) HAD A BLAST.   The staff assisted with pumping balloons, setting up my picture backdrop/balloon garland, and the set up for the cake table.   THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER! No Party Stress for me.  I should add also... FRIENDLY AND ACCOMMODATING STAFF!

Review: I've been taking my 17 month old here twice a week during the Toddler times. We've been about 5 times now & he always has a good time. The gym is wide open so he can run around & there's tons of fun toys for him to play with. There's a bunch of fun swings & things to climb on but he hasn't figured those out yet. Overall, the place is clean & well put together. It's been a great place for him to be exposed to new people. It hasn't been over run with kids duringthe 10am-12pm times we're there, so it hasn't been overwhelming for him. If like me, you've been looking for a fun safe place to let your toddler play freely while exposing them to new people & things, then this is it. Definitely recommend!

The toys, swings, zipline and other things are such a totally good time for little kids (1-8 years old).. will tire them right out naturally. The 2 ladies running the place for our party were fun, funny and gracious. They're very accommodating and it was a blast!

I know it can be hard at times to find places that's accepting of kids with special needs, but my asd child was very comfortable there and so was I. This place really sets the tone in welcoming children with different abilities and it shows even in the people that attend, no dirty looks or snooty remarks from anyone, you will be comfortable and so will your child.

Our favorite was the circle swing. It was good to get out the house and off to an indoor playground and meet new friends.

Theres a gift shop in the corner that sells cool stuff and i hope they bring in more variety of sizes in the dress up clothing section. Will definitely come back soon!

Some are more physical than others, but we loved having the options. I was so grateful that there were a lot of activities to try without the booming loud music and obnoxious strobe lights.

The place was beyond clean, and Mr. Luke was very welcoming. 10/10 recommend.

My autistic daughter took less then 15 minute's to get use to this new place, which typically take 30 - 40 minutes for her. This place is such a relief for my 4 year old & they made it clear that I didn't have to tell her to keep it down like most places we go. They said this place is made for her! She can be loud and comfortable, they also interacted so well with my kids! I almost cried tears of joy hearing and seeing that! The colors, toy's, also the set up is so calming & not overwhelming! Did I mention they also have a calming room! Which is absolutely awesome! They do birthday parties too and I think soon classes!! Best believe we shall be booking one asap! DONT WALK RUN TO THIS PLACE! ITS FANTASTIC!

Review: Wishing I could give zero stars because this place is clearly biased when it came to some things.
Some large short haired lady followed me and my nieces around and was yelling and being extremely rude to them and telling them what they can and can't do even though other kids was able to do whatever they wanted.
Then acted like I was wrong for asking why she was yelling at them for other things kids was clearly allowed to do.
This isn't the first time we came here and this has happened, something similar happened before they upgraded their stuff.
My sister in-law payed for a whole day pass and couldn't even stay for a hour because of how rude some staff was being.
Highly suggest not taking your children here.

Unfortunately, they are doing a great job perpetuating the concept that poor inner-city neighbors garner poor service. The lack curtiousness was abundant, and it's highly likely that you would get better service from a business in a better neighborhood.

We didn’t get into the room until 7:30 and the party was over by 9 .  The staff turned the music off and deflated the moon bounces before 9. The staff was very rude and unprofessional . They have a policy  that if you leave on time you get your deposit back but how is that when your party is already 30 minutes past schedule and you have no set up time never ever again   Such a rip off

As we was walking away the young lady came out, and said give us 10 mins, because of the politeness of everyone there, and the fact that she took a request, and played Badanamu for my grand baby. I made sure I spent money, on drinks, and snacks. See you again soon!

Review: Playground itself is 4 stars but it is designed for young children and it is almost always overcrowded with older kids running and roughhousing with no (active) parental supervision and no monitoring by the mall itself. I understand if they are older sibling of toddlers/preschoolers but they should be told to look out for little kids and let them enjoy the climbers first. On more than one occasion I’ve had a child tell me their parent was shopping and they were there alone. We try to go at off hours but lord help you if it’s raining.

Review: Spacious, clean and age-appropriate. It has various themes and it seems fun. HOWEVER, these things turn pointless when there are children WAY OLDER jumping and stomping around. This play area clearly seemed to be designed for the younger little ones and the older - pre teens taking over the whole area makes it unsafe and a hazard. Wish parents (glued on their phones) and security staff were more conscious about this.

Review: I am really upset with our visit. This playground is clearly for ages 1-4 judging by the set up and equipment, and we went specifically for my 1 year old to crawl around. There were about 6 children, all around 6-8, rough housing, throwing each other around,  playing tag and being maniacs in this baby play area. I put my baby on the ground to crawl around and he was loving it, but almost got trampled 3-4 times because the other large children were not even paying attention, and no parent was telling them to be aware of other children.  In fact no parent was paying attention at all. So we had to leave, my baby was screaming because he loved it so much and we couldn't stay because these other large children were playing in a baby playground. The rules say you must be under 42"" to play so there was no reason for them to be there. Columbia mall, you need to do better. These kids have other areas to rough house in the mall.

Review: Can get crowded but there's lots for younger kids to do: slides, climbing, running, motor skills activities, etc. The floor is padded pretty well to keep risk of injuries to a minimum.
There are shoe cubbies if you want to use them and a large amount of fairly comfortable seating areas / padded benches for the adults.
Usually pretty clean. They do close I think between 2 and 3pm daily to clean it. Obviously, however, kids will need to wash hands well after playing here.

Review: No.  Just no.  Always overly crowded.  I've seen tots without diapers running around (naked, no pants) in this play area.  A child/teen who was clearly too old to be in this playspace was running around and jumping off the statues.  He landed/slammed on my 19 month old who I couldn't shield in time.  Thankfully she wasn't hurt and the kid apologized, but still.  There are rules posted but not really enforced here.  You can't expect much since it's free but I won't be taking my kids back to this mall play area or any for that matter.

Review: Imaginarium has been such a foundational part of our homeschool story. In the early days when I wasn’t sure I could do this, the support I found here reminded me that I wasn’t alone.

It’s more than a program—it’s a safe space. You know your kids are truly seen here. The staff care deeply, everything is clean and thoughtful, and most of all, they get to know you. Your family becomes part of the community, not just another name on a list.

From the workshops and enrichment classes to the unforgettable events like LEGO Night, the Living History Museum, and that emotional moment watching our oldest graduate from kindergarten, Imaginarium has helped us shape a learning journey full of joy, confidence, and connection.

My kiddos love the toys and the one of a kind play equipment that is provided. We’ve gone to almost every event they have hosted. We go to the Open Play which the kids love and so do I, because on occasion I’ll bring work to get done. The kids stay entertained the entire time we are there! We’ve had a birthday party there, which was hands down incredible. We’ve done the Kids Night Out events, we love that we can trust the staff and our kids feel safe. Recently, we did Meet & Greet with Santa and I don’t think we’ll ever go anywhere else to see Santa again. It was affordable, enjoyable, and above all expectations. We are so lucky to have this incredible business in our community!

The teachers are amazing, the other family's are welcoming and Lenae, the owner,  puts on so many different activities for the kids so they don't feel like they are losing out on what traditional school offers. They have classroom learning, structured gym, free play, holiday parties, school pictures, workshops and even dances plus more.

We even had a family emergency last year and Lenae worked with us to ensure my kids didn't lose their place after taking off ""school"" for over 2 months. This place was such a blessing to find. I would highly recommend checking them out.

It's insane the owner is probably getting people to leave positive reviews when parents are being honest about how yucky this place is. It's a place for small children. It should be sanitary. :( Overall just sad.

Review: I’d you desire a safe place for your children to explore, play and be creative.. this is it! Even better is the area for parents. I come here regularly and work while my children play. It’s such a friendly, clean and inviting environment.

I liked the place so much that I now teach there in their homeschool program too! The owner provides ample opportunities for the children of our community from play, tutoring, birthday parties, and a complete homeschool enrichment program.

I have been present for clean up time between open play and homeschool classes and I have been present for after hours clean up. The team does a great job and cares about your children’s time there to be in a clean environment. The team worked together to get a good sanitize down before the next group of kids came in and end of day clean up is always a good deep clean.

Last thing to point out is the pirates cove! My kids love the art supplies provided, the crafts available and all the items in the shop up front.

Overall cannot say enough about the Imaginarium! The place has become a staple in my children’s (and my own!) lives 💗

Review: Imaginarium is one of my favorite places in Calvert! I feel so comfortable letting my niece and nephew play here. Kids are able to express themselves and make friends, while they also get to play on different structures and equipment. Also, the facility is SUPER clean for being a children’s playground, the staff even goes around every so often (I’d say every 10 minutes) to wipe all toys and play structures down after children play with them. The bathrooms have CLEAN changing tables, and the snack area has complimentary tea and coffee! Love it!!
Did I mention the staff is very attentive and helpful? They will assure everyone is safe.
They have a few different play structures with different surprises inside each one, kitchen, dinos, trains, and more. There is even air hockey, building blocks, and crafts for the older kiddos to do if they tag along. I just can’t wait to watch Imaginarium grow and see what other cool stuff they have to offer in the future. This place is awesome!!! 10/10 Recommend!

Review: We love Imaginarium for many reasons, the first being the space is big enough for kids to run around and make friends, but not too large where I feel the need to know exactly where they are at all times while playing. I'm able to relax because I know they are playing in a safe place. It's not filled with loud bounce houses and music like a couple of the other indoor playgrounds we have visited within the state. They do sometimes have music playing, but families don't have to shout over it to be heard.

The staff are friendly folk, it's affordable, you can bring food in and sit in the seating area (sans peanut products), its not overstimulating, and it's just a gem of a place to have local to us in SOMD.

Review: I took my 20 month old daughter to Imaginarium today, and I was really disappointed. First, it was FILTHY. The toys were NOT clean at all, the wall decor and houses were covered in thick dust like they hadn't been cleaned since they opened, the equipment was covered in months worth of dirty handprints. At one point, my daughter was playing in the blue foam blocks and picked up a huge ball of hair. Disgusting. I get that children aren't always the cleanest little people, but for that reason they should have a daily cleaning crew. Clearly they do NOT. Secondly,  the rules state socks must be worn... but kids were barefoot. I get it's summer but kids are climbing all over the place... where sweaty feet are. Finally, there needs to be an age/height limit. There were huge kids like 6-7 yos running around, rough-housing, putting the littles at risk of getting run over and hurt. I thought this place was exclusively for younger children ( < 5) but I guess not. I really wanted to like this place because it has great potential.  It is a great idea and has a lil lounge and store... but I cannot get fast how gross it was. I should have taken more pictures but I was too busy making sure my daughter wouldn't get run over by the big kids. :/ Sadly, I won't be taking my kiddo back.

Review: Art clubs, Kids Night Out, themed events, Homeschool play meet ups, homeschool “parties”/events, private parties, open play hours, honestly there isn’t much this place doesn’t do. Throughout our time here, I have leaned on this place to help my kiddo grow in a safe and imaginative environment and I have never been disappointed. The play structures are incredibly intricate and promote imagination that I know many kids are losing sight off with the new age of electronics. I love the staff here. They are sincerely caring, helpful, and attentive. There is not much for kids to do in this area and this place has been an addition that enhances the community tremendously. The prices are also phenomenal. While the cost of everything is on the rise, the pricing here has been consistent without sacrificing value. I also love that the owner will utilize and promote other products of small businesses! Thank y’all for everything you have done for my family and we will miss this place when we leave.

Review: We loved everything about Imaginarium! The space is huge and clean, the play structures were so much fun for my daughters, and my husband and I had plenty of places to sit where we could keep an eye on them and enjoy a cup of coffee from their cafe area. Both my 2 and 7 year olds really enjoyed themselves. I only wished we lived close by to attend some of their amazing programs and play regularly! Highly recommend!

Review: What an incredible party we had here. The entire process of scheduling, planning and getting there was so easy! You owe it to yourself to bring your littles to this wonderful place. So much space inside, such fun things to do and it was so clean! The staff was so friendly, professional and helpful! This place felt “safe” and that is a huge deal, especially in this day and age.

Review: I really wanted to love this place, but it was underwhelming. IMO the price is a little too steep for what you get.

The play structures are super cool. I loved the art section and the reading nook, but there’s so much unrealized potential.

There are little toys scattered throughout like legos, train sets, magna tiles, and play food, but it’s such a mess. We couldn’t play with some of them because they were missing pieces, or didn’t seem to actually go together. I get it, tons of kids come every day, but there are so many organizational options that could be used to actually encourage play and imagination, like the name says.

The art section was super cute, but again, underwhelming. The only things available were construction paper, a few random crayons and colored pencils, dried out markers with mixed tops, scissors, and chalk. There are so many ways to make this more exciting and organized. Especially since we paid to play here.

The reading nook is a great concept, but it’s right next to the giant castle/ship structure, so it doesn’t really lend itself to reading. There was a cool, giant bear, but that got put away because someone used it as a landing pad for the slide. The books seemed pretty random and old. Everything in this place could be so much more!

I was also disappointed in kid behavior. I know there’s not much employees may be able to do, but it’s dangerous. Kids throwing things and roughhousing on top of two-story structures shouldn’t be acceptable when people are paying money to play here.

In all honesty, I feel like I just took my kids to an indoor playground and paid $22 for it. I don’t think it’s worth it. It could be in the future, but it’s not right now.

Review: This place is awesome! I have taken our 3 year old twins twice now and it's really great on days when it's raining or too cold to play outside! It's very unique and I absolutely recommend! Staff were friendly and helpful both times we've gone, and i also noticed staff does go around and disinfect through out the play sessions. There's always been lots of other children when we've gone and there's lots of interaction which is great social skills for kids! We will definitely go back! Great place!

Review: Place needs a deep cleaning from the ceiling to the floors. I mean days' worth of cleaning.

We enjoy going to this place to escape the heat. However, every single time....and I do mean every single time I end up sick after we go there.

The dust can be seen from the tops of the playground. The rubber mats are disgusting black.

A little boy got hurt from where the game fell over on him.

I will be trying to find other activities for the remainder of 5 weeks of summer.

Im depending on you guys to clean up. I dont plan on coming back anytime soon. When I do, Im bringing a germ bacteria detector.

Get them girls who sit at the front desk texting/on their phone to start cleaning. When I come back, I want to see them wiping and scrubbing everything non-stop.

Review: Kind of disappointed with them this time . We came a few years ago and liked it . Came back this morning at opening , I was by myself with my two kids . Which both are autistic , and then 20 minutes later they accepted bus loads of students . I get it’s a public place , but I really wish I would’ve been informed that they had like a field trip or whatever coming . I would have just came back later . I paid full price and only got half an hour with my kiddos inside . I can’t keep track of two children by myself with a small room full of probably 100 some kids . I had to apologize to my kids for wasting their time , and I’m pretty upset I wasted my money . Personally I think they should’ve let me know , or just book a few hours specifically for the field trip and not accept other guests . A lot of these kids were playing in the zone meant for much smaller kids . I had kids 3 times the size of my 2 and 4 year old trampling over them to go down toddler slides . Very disappointing .

Review: I brought my grandson to a party at Ready Set Play, I have never been so appalled at the behavior of a business owner. Instead of pulling the party host to the side to say that her time was up, he basically almost threw us out of the room to set up for the next party. The arrogant attitude about his 5 star rating and how many parties he throws a year was mind blowing. So it's all about the money and how many turnovers he has in one day seems to be the goal, not the birthday experience for the child. I pray whoever reads this post creates a business that will close this business. Parents that spend this type of money should not have to endure rude, arrogant and pretentious behavior.

Review: Friendly staff and a great place to let your kiddo burn off some energy. They have a great softplay area and several slides on the 2-story play structure, as well as a small arcade and cafe. We stopped on our way to Lancaster to let our little guy stretch his legs and it was well worth the $10.

Review: I have been hesitant to take my daughter to an indoor play gym. They just seem so dirty, but the reviews raved about how clean this place was, and they were right! We highly recommend Ready, Set, Play. My daughter (20 months) had a blast and could play on almost everything! She even made a new friend. Oh, make sure you have socks because you have to buy them if you don't. They're like a couple dollars.

I love that the obstacle course was tall enough I could easily walk through to help my niece. They had an amazing toddler area! They had a little food court and an arcade area. It was clean and staff was friendly.

A great place for a kid just to cut loose. I think there should be a barrier between the kitchen and the tables. A gate between the video games and the play area. A gate between the little toddler section and the walkway. Just a suggestion. Great place.

Review: My daughter at ready,set,play. She loved it. And she turns 2 next month. It was her first time. But once they start crawling they can start going. They have a crawler area. Which is more like a baby toddler area. But my daughter still enjoyed it. This would be good for Roxie for a long time. The small playground it's good up to age 12 or something. There was a ball pit. She loved. A balloon box. If I could rate it 4.5 if I could. I loved the place for my daughter. I just hope the vacuum in the back. My daughter found a dead stinkbug and almost ate it. I'd still take her back cause there isn't many indoor playgrounds where we live.

I weigh 235 lbs, and I don't feel any of the play sets sway or wobble under me while I chase around my 2 year old. The staff is courteous and efficient, which is also amazing considering how many people they are catering to. The variety of equipment and games is also great, so your kid(s) won't have trouble finding something they enjoy. There's plenty of seating, and food available too. I highly recommend this place for any occasion. It's also worth mentioning that they have party times available. We had a great time and loved it!

Review: Nice place for a reasonable price. If you are planning a trip, you can sign the release form ahead of time by completing it online via their website. There’s a small cafe where they sell snacks and drinks. Children can run and play at one price for hours. Pictures shown is from the cafe view. There is an area for children under 7 and a separate area for the older children. The weight limit for playing is 250, so many adults can also enjoy playing with the children.

The owner/manager was also present when we were there and seemed very hands on with running things and was very friendly. We were there for four hours and our kids left exhausted. We were able to play with them so we had a blast. Their in house pizza is also pretty good.

The prices are amazing, you pay and have the entire day open to close to play and have fun. Everything is big and sturdy so parents can join in on the fun too I know I did both times I've been there! Babies 1 year and under are free when accompanying a sibling, ages 1-3 (I believe) are like 10$ and 2 adults per family is allowed for free. So myself, my sister in law, my 11 month old and 2 year old went on a Wednesday for only 10$!! It was amazing. Prices for fri-sun are like 5$ more expensive but still not bad at all. So much to do and everything is very well padded so it's nice and safe. It's just a blast and I wanna live there. Lol

Diana was exceptional to communicate with and her staff that were present for the party handled everything from setup, to following the schedule of events, to cleaning up.

Review: This indoor playground started out nice. It's on the smaller size but it's a good size to keep eyes on children. However, the upkeep is little to non existent. The owner needs to invest more to keep it updated and clean. The AC unit has been broken for over a year.   It's definitely not worth the cost of what they charge. The staff is great. Be sure to call ahead on weekends sometimes private parties close the entire place. The owner also split the party room to jam more parties on the weekends which makes the cost way too high.

They assisted with setup, guided us through the flow of the party, and made sure everything ran smoothly, allowing us to relax and enjoy the celebration.

The facility was spotless and clearly well cared for, which was such a relief with a group of toddlers playing and exploring. The space is bright, safe, and full of fun perfect for little ones to enjoy themselves.

We’re so grateful to the Junior PLAYLAND team for helping us create such a joyful and memorable day for our son. We highly recommend this place to any parent looking for a clean, welcoming, and stress-free venue for their child’s special day or for something to do with your little one!

Review: Junior playland is one of my son's favorite indoor playgrounds. Although it is not a large facility, it's not usually very crowded and it offers a good variety of activities: ball pit, slide, trampoline, etc. Each kid ticket includes 2 adults for free and you come out and in as many times as you want, which makes it convenient. They offer an unlimited monthly subscription and birthday parties packages with the option of making them private. In fact, I recommend calling or checking their website before getting there during weekends, since private events are common. Parking is easy and cheap at Ballston mall garage.

Review: The place is new, so relatively clean. But it is poorly designed, metal posts and beams are not properly covered and high spaces aren’t properly netted to protect from falls. This is not like Scramble (I’m not affiliated)- which is designed with safety in mind. Not safe for toddlers, my son was standing, turned, lost his balance and fell from one of these areas and although there was some padding on the bottom level (completely inadequate), he ended up with a collar bone injury.

Review: This place is the best for toddlers.  I’ve brought both my kids, under age 5 ,and they always have a blast. Everything they have is age appropriate for young kids and enough to get them excited and tired. The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and stocked. My only critiques, and I write this in the hopes it helps,  is that they kept up with what’s supposed to be engaging. They have a small balloon area in a trampoline but the balloons were old and deflated. Seems like that’s something the front desk could easily keep up with.  The screen where the ball pit is, is designed for kids to throw balls at it but it was off the whole time we were there. The music is only on for a few minutes and no one cares to turn it back on. The toys for the stations are not enough and  missing completely. For example the doctor station doesn’t have any actual doctor toys like a stethoscope, tongs, pretend bandages.  The cafe station has nothing. The grocery store has toys but also a lot the things in there are broken.  I think if the stations had the adequate toys kids would actually pretend play.

I told a staff member that balloons are a choking hazard, and she took out some of the popped balloons in the space. Truly a deadly item and children continued popping balloons/ playing in the area. This play space clearly markets itself to toddlers but I won’t be returning while the space is set up in an unsafe way.

From the very beginning, she was incredibly responsive, patient, and detail-oriented, making the planning process so much easier for us.

Maryam truly went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was perfectly executed, which made the day both seamless and special for us.

Her positive energy and genuine enthusiasm created a warm and inviting atmosphere for both the kids and parents. She was proactive in addressing any last-minute needs and always had a thoughtful solution ready.

The level of care and attention she put into making sure my children and their guests were happy was truly impressive. I can’t thank her enough for her dedication—she turned what could have been a stressful event into a joyful, memorable experience.

I highly recommend working with Maryam for anyone looking to plan a special birthday.

Review: I’m a bit late reviewing as we hosted my toddler’s birthday here late summer. It was perfect for our group of 20 kids + up to 2 adults per kid. There might have been 4-6 other kids not part of the party there, so if we had invited more, I feel it would’ve been a private party. It’s not huge, but we liked the space and being able to see all the kids without feeling like we had to run around searching for them. The party room was a comfortably fit everyone. Meryem and her staff set up with the table, decor, and donuts, drinks and goodie bags we brought (they allow outside vendors!) She kept in touch with me beforehand to keep track of headcount and confirm pizza order. Everything from setup to cleanup was smooth, our friends even ended booking their kids birthday party here!

The private back room was large with plenty of tables and chairs for kids and adults. Bathrooms are also large, individual, and have good diaper changing stations. Juniors provided themed decoration, tablecloths, plates, cutlery, juice, pizza, and balloon stands. We chose to use our own decoration to match the unicorn theme. Meryem helped set up and was super helpful and always available for whatever we needed.

As for the play area, there is a great variety of things, including ball pit, merry-go-round, climbing area, pretend play, trampoline, slide, and more. 100% recommend for birthdays or anytime!

Review: Updating my review to 3 stars. My experience with having a birthday party there was great and very hassle free. Maryam was very accommodating. The front entrance remains to not be gated.

This place has gone a bit downhill since it opened. It's not the safest because there is no door barrier at the entrance so your kid can run out at any time, and they open a door in the back as well.

The website says the max age limit is 10 years of age. When it first opened, they would tell customers at the entrance that the limit is 8-9 years. Today they told me that the age limit is 12 years old. A lot of older kids (prob older than 12) were playing there and they were playing ROUGH. NOT safe for small kids. I don't understand what business kids older than 8ish have in this playground. It is def. geared toward little ones but nobody is controlling that. They just want your money and it's a bit on the pricey side considering how small it is.

Review: We had our daughter's 3rd birthday party at Juniors Playland, and it was lovely! Maryam was very easy to work with and was always available to answer questions and provide guidance. We had a private reservation for the full place, which is perfect for a party on the larger size. Unfortunately we all had to leave right after our booking time ended because there was another private booking after us, which we did not know and were planning to stick around for longer to allow kids to keep playing. Best to ask about private reservations before / after yours so there are no surprises.

Review: I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with both the terms of the unlimited access membership I purchased for my two children and the unprofessional conduct of your staff members, Ivy and Brianna. Despite the promise of unlimited access, my children were unable to enjoy the playground on two separate occasions this week due to private events that closed the facility. This limitation was not disclosed when I purchased the membership, and it feels misleading and unfair.

Furthermore, the interactions with your staff were disappointing. Both Ivy and Brianna were not only rude during our conversations, but they also found humor in our situation, which is unacceptable and does not reflect well on your establishment.

I would appreciate a clarification on the membership terms and an explanation of how you will address the staff behavior to ensure a welcoming environment for all your guests.

Review: I recently had my daughter 2nd birthday party here. She had a great time. I love how the party room is private for your guest. The staff was so helpful during decor set up. The kids had a wonderful time. Spent most of the time in the play area. I passed out extra goodie bags to other kids who were there.There is a parking garage and it’s only a $1. We had the space for 2 hours but were able to extend an extra hour for a reasonable price. There are food places inside the mall if you want to grab a bite. I do recommend wearing socks because you can not wear your shoes inside in the play area. Adults as well. But over all definitely a 10/10. I would recommend this place for toddlers parties or just a day to get out of the house. Be back soon.

The biggest shout-out goes to the manager Meryem who managed all our party logistics and made the special day seamless, stress-free, and joyful.

Review: Excellent indoor playground located on the first floor in Ballston Quarter Mall. The place is clean and a decent size. Great for birthday parties as you can book their private room. I would say, recommended age is probably for kids not older than 6 years old. Parking is relatively cheap for this area as you need to pay right after you park as the mall uses a license plate reader and registes your plates as you enter. 3 hours is around a dollar and some change.

They have made friends with the other regulars and it’s always a blast. We also had my son’s birthday party here and it was incredible. Great value and Meryem was THES BEST! She helped us decorate and break down after the party.

The place is always clean, including its bathrooms. You can’t beat easy parking and tons of food options around the corner. It gets busy sometimes but never to the point where kids’ safety is compromised.

We are so grateful to have this indoor playground nearby! Wish I could give 100 stars because with two very active boys and a harsh winter, this place has been a dream.

As if the name junior doesn’t betray it, there is a sign that clearly states that the playground is for tots so don’t bring kids older than 5 as there will be nothing for them. It’s on the first (ground) floor of the mall. There is no security to speak of so watch the open entrance for kids on the loose.

Review: It’s cute. Definitely a crammed area with a lot of kids but that’s to be expected.

I will say BE CAREFUL OF THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE.  Both my daughter and me went down separately and hurt our tailbones. The balls move around so you smack your bottom on the super hard surface. There needs to be some type of cushioning at the bottom of the slide. It’s soooooo painful.

Luckily my kids didn’t see the LARGE interactive screen thing because I don’t see the point in having screen time at an activity center- it’s just not for me but to each their own.}","Virginia","juniorplayland.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","22203"

Review: We recently visited Hyper Kidz Ashburn. This indoor play area is a vibrant and candy themed, and kids can burn energy and enjoy. There is something for every age group. Toddlers have a separate play section for their safety. The floor and all the play equipments are padded for children’s safety.
Additionally, the place is very well maintained. The staff are friendly.

Review: Be aware that this business requires you to sign a liability waiver with an exculpatory clause, meaning you give up your right to sue even if they injure your child due to their own negligence. I find it unacceptable that they try to avoid responsibility for their own mistakes or unsafe practices. Think twice before taking your kids here.

Review: Our 2.5 year old had a blast. He couldn't wait for us to finish the registration before he took off running to the toddler area. The customer service was great at check-in. There is plenty of shoe storage. They also have a small café for you to order food and sit down. There are four bounce houses of various sizes, three step 2 roller coasters, a couple of areas to build with blocks, pretend play areas, an indoor playground with multiple slides, enclosed area for kids under 2, Lego area, and bumper cars. I think I saw an arcade in the back, too! Overall, it was a good experience. Some of the lighting was a little dim. It had some wear and tear. To us, it wasn't too expensive compared to other places we've been for the number of options they had. I would check them out!

The place looks good but customer service is lacking especially at the kids ride area , the operator prevented my kids from using it even though I have paid and the kids passing the height tests . He wouldn’t do that to anybody else except me because  we were Africans , I argued with them and the manager cannot even say sorry to a customer , she only offered to give me $4 back and I rejected it . I’m not going back there again .

Review: I saw several reviews that mentioned how clean this place is. Well, my grandson (17 months old) and I were the first to arrive. I picked up a raisin out of the toddler play area, then a barret, that he almost put in his mouth, out of one the bouncey houses and a used tissue out of one of the other play areas. They could not have cleaned or even did a walk through prior to this morning's opening. All these items are choking hazards for a toddler.
I've been to the beehive numerous times. I used to take my 7 year old granddaughter when she was a toddler. It was always clean.
I advise anyone taking a small child to the Beehive to be extra vigilant.

Review: Horrible place. Empty sanitizers. Dirty toys. Dirty place. Horrible service. We came 40-45 minutes before closing. They just told us we are about to close and we said it’s fine. None of the workers mentioned that they start literally CLOSING every play area and cleaning 30 MINUTES before closing. Why was that not mention to us until we gave them our money?! Bunch of thieves. Until we paid and went inside. The only place was the slides, moon bounce, foam blocks and some climbing things. My kids barely got to enjoy anything and we paid too much for what it was worth. There were so many other things. I’ve been to HyperKidz in Ashburn and JollyYolly in Fairfax, way better service, cleaning, friendlier/professional staff (better at HyperKidz) and even if you come last minute before closing. They let you play with everything and don’t close off anything until closing time. It’s absolutely ridiculous that BeeHive does this with dirty equipment and toys. Too many rules . We paid $35 for a 22 month old and 10 month and extra $5 for the third adult. Ridiculous pricing and no discount given. We complained to staff and they just smiled… absolutely unprofessional. This place will go out of business. Mark my word. Don’t waste your time coming here with your babies and go to HyperKidz or at least JollyYolly. Way cleaner, they ACTUALLY CLOSE AT THEIR GIVEN TIME and not start closing every single play area 30 minutes before.

Review: I had my daughter’s birthday on January 8th at 3:30. I paid spent $800 total overall and it was the worst birthday ever. There was two birthdays at the same time and they allowed a lot of public guests as well it was so crowded I could not keep an eye on my kids and our party with 2 hour limit it seemed impossible to let the kids play and eat and cut the cake. They advertise a dedicated party host but the girl helped me at the beginning and never showed up until the party was over, they ran out of cups and napkins we had to wait for them to go buy from outside and bring it. They also placed my daughters unicorn cake away from the decorations so we have the plain side on all of our pictures. The banner on the back also read Irthday  instead of birthday, they also gifted her a size 7 t shirt when she is only 2. It also mentioned thank you cards for guests we did not get this either. I called a few times to voice my concerns the employees either pretended to be the manager and ignore me or they said manager is in a meeting. I got a call from the manager who just apologized and that’s it there was no compensation for all the bad things we experienced from their service. They do not keep tabs on children either like chucky Cheese so if someone picks up your child and walks out the door with anyone they don’t care and don’t know . I gave them a chance to call me back but they haven’t so I am writing my experience for other parents here. Do not have a birthday here it’s a waste of money. They do not have the best service and packages are not as advertised.

Review: Location: Not good
Cleanliness: OK
Customer Service: Terrible
Playground: Very Good

I would like to first say that this is my first ever Google review. I am one to read reviews but not write one. Having that said, I felt strongly about sharing this experience with fellow parents looking for an indoor playground in Woodbridge. Our first impression was not great as it is located in a sketchy area of Woodbridge but once we got inside we were impressed with the size and amount of activities offered. The staff is mainly made up of young women and unfortunately our first interaction with a staff member working the front desk was terrible. The young lady was clearly irritated from the moment my son and I walked in, as if we inconvenienced her by our presence.  This comment is intended for management/ owner  to train staff members to use common courtesy with customers. Mind you, we were not walking in late or right before closing for the staff member to have such a bad attitude towards us. We were simply trying to get in..anyways, after a very rude interaction, my son enjoyed his time while we were there. He is 2 and enjoys just running around.  The staff members would walk by every few minutes to reorganize toys but they would outwardly show their discontent while picking up. Very rude attitude towards the kids and parents. They clearly do not enjoy being there and doing their job. Although, no one says anything about the staffs bad attitude, parents  and children can sense it. That is not the environment a “play”ground should have. Management- please train your staff to be courteous to parents and children using the facility and paying $14 per kid for only 1.5 hr of play time. In addition, although the closing time says 7pm,  they sometimes close as early as 6:30pm at their discretion. If you get there thinking you will get 1.5hrs of playtime, you end up getting  less because they decide to close early but you still pay for the 90 min- unfair business practice. Hours of operation are inconsistent. All in all, the place offers a good amount of space and activities for kiddos do exert energy but that is IT. Expect nothing from staff but bad looks and nasty attitudes. All that matters is seeing my son have fun and for that and only that reason I would go back. I wish there were more options in the area, but for now, this will do.

Review: On November 6th 2022 was my 2nd time taking my 2 granddaughters who are 4 and 3 years old to the Bee Hive. Every since I took them the first time they would ask to go back. The first experience was pretty good and my granddaughters had a blast. The staff was quite friendly. Our recent visit was great as well and the staff was friendly as well and there was one staff member who was phenomenal and was really great to interact with and her name is Paris. She was really friendly and I had a issue with the air hockey game and she immediately took care of it. There was a delay in the game puck being released so by the time I informed her about the issue another family was playing the game. I told the family that the game was on me and Paris refunded my $1 although I wasn’t worried about it. So to Paris I thought she was really awesome and just gave out a wonderful vibe as I watched her interact with other customers as well. So 👍👍👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 to Paris for all that she’s done.}","Virginia","beehivepark.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","22191"

Review: Wonderful place and great fun for the price. My only complaint - please make it cooler inside the facility. It's always way too hot inside and my daughter specifically doesn't like going because she gets so hot so quickly. If they just made it a good 10 degrees cooler, this place would be hands down 5 stars.

Review: Tldr: ok at best, no kid food options
It was ...ok. Nice structure but small, brand new bounce house, but small, and the slides were a hit, but also only one attraction. The whole thing looks sad and dirty. I found a bloody bandaid in the ball pit, which honestly is to be expected, but just pointed out other hygienic deficiencies. The ball pit is one thing, but construction fencing for walls and dirty floors are just... sad. My kids, 2 and 4, were no longer interested in the entire facility within 1 hour. Then, they do not allow outside food, and the only food options are the Green Cafe. The Lamb Gyro WAS AMAZING, but my kids aren't going to eat that. There were no options that were kid centric and no options for any sort of snacks, healthy or otherwise, outside of ice cream. Unless major change comes we will just opt to head to Hagerstown or literally anywhere else.

I’d rather not have to keep driving a half hour to Hagerstown to enjoy Ready, Set, Play when there is a perfectly good place right here in town.

I wish there was someone dedicated to the slide because parents are letting their kids climb up it and so others can’t go down. Other than that I recommend this place and the bonus is their food space will be open in 10 days!!!

(your not aloud to climb up the slides, was told by staff)

Review: Not a huge fan of this place.. the playground is alright, pretty spaced and skimpy on the ""obstacles"".  The game area is trash, a DOLLAR PER game.. and half the games don't take the poker chip you're given to play them.  Plus the plugs are visible and accessible to the children with cords on the ground.
It was clean, but I wasn't too keen on the idea of using the bathroom without shoes (no shoes for children or adults past the entry gate)
Also, had to wait a decent amount of time before someone showed up at the front desk to ""check"" us in..
We won't be back.

Review: Pros: big open space, various activities, cool slides with inner tube things, blocks, ball pit, just great stuff overall, seemed pretty clean, bathrooms were clean, staff was super friendly

Cons: no separation by age; 15-year-olds were pushing past my 2-year-old. The floor mats weren't flush so the foam puzzle bits came up and caused trip hazards- my kid ate the floor twice & so did a few other kids, blocks had chunks bitten out of them(pretty par for the course of foam blocks though lol), and some of the suspension work was twisty carbines which came undone, not life or death but a kid falling onto the safety net might mess up their day

Overall: fun play place, kids enjoyed their time & we will be returning!

While I hoped to stay informed about the venue as my child had an enjoyable time, this has soured my view of the ownership and business.  Even more annoying, there's no verification that I was a potential constituent.

Review: I’ve been coming to this place with my kids since it opened. When it first opened there was a quality and appearance to the staff. One could say they had the appearance of getting paid well. Over time my wife and I noticed that the space was being using for more events. Ways to charge more money while remaining open to the public. Today, the fees compared to a few years ago were higher, my wife and I had to pay, yet as you can see from the photo, the money isn’t going back into the facility. Look the patch of bare AstroTurf by the slides on the main crawling hill for toddlers.

This is owned by someone that wants to represent our liberal county government. This space they feel is appropriate for toddlers to crawl on, their service of alcohol to parents, literally walking around the play space with their beer, it is in my opinion a perfect representation of what David Blair is about. Profiting off of selling the dream....while slowly cheapening the dream from his gated mansion. Never again, Badlands.

Edit 3.18.20 • This is perfect. Let’s make sure to all remember that the day county schools and preschools decided to close for the safety of our children and families, the powers that be at Badlands decided to try to STAY OPEN AND OFFER DAYCARE for the following week!! Only to send an email out the day classes were due to start, to day they’re closing.

Why should we remember this? Because this business is clearly a way for someone who hopes to be county executive to charm (pander to) county residents. Don’t let it work. Remember this when he runs again.

Review: We had our son's 3rd Birthday Party at Badlands just a couple weeks ago and it was hands down, the BEST experience.  The pavilion space was a Superhero theme and it was all very organized and clean when we arrived and the staff was SO helpful. Especially Katy, our dedicated party attendant who helped wrangle all our crazy kids when it was time to do games, crafts, sing happy birthday, etc. Thanks Katy!  Badlands seriously raised the bar and we will definitely be coming back again soon! XOXO

Review: Badlands is a cool concept and we really enjoy our visits. It’s especially great for stay at home parents with little ones during the week. My son is 3 so the toddler time during the weekdays is perfect for him and his age group.The staff is friendly and the activities provide just the right amount of entertainment and challenge. On the weekends (with a 3 yr old) it is a bit hectic, so get there early if you have littles and can’t go during the week.

I recently had a challenge with our family’s membership. I appreciated the care management took to maintain the relationship and fix the problem. We look forward to future visits and recommend Badlands.

Food appeared to be pretty decent and they have a good selection of adult beverages.

Review: this is such a wonderful and unique place! My daughter loves it and I like that its safe environment for her to spend time playing and socializing. We just had her 2 year birthday here and we couldn’t have been happier. They were so accommodating and very easy to work with. I also highly recommend getting the toddler time membership deal (if you have a toddler). It really pays for itself. Between the slides, the workshop and the ample amount of running space, my daughter can use up her energy and then some. Rain or shine, we are there.

There are activities, balls to roll, big legos to put together, a giant fake rock to climb, slide through, etc.  The place has a big giant soft astro turf floor and softens falls.  We went to a birthday party there which was well run.  The staff was enthusiastic, helpful, and particularly friendly.  The place is decently expensive, but in a convenient location.  There's also some easy food for sale.

Friends have been made, mountains have been climbed, art, yoga, jam sessions, dance offs, sensory workshops, super reasonably price good food (not to mention REALLY good craft beer).  Staff is always helpful, watching the younger ones on top of the mountain, assisting with art projects, ect.  My girls all scream and run to participate at the announcement that yoga is happening in the studio 😍  Just an AWESOME place to go, run, let off some energy and have fun these cold winter months.  I recommended Badlands to all our friends.

Review: This indoor outdoor space is pretty unique, always a must during the winter months. My kids usually have a good time. I do think they shouldn't charge admission for adults however. Most adults that go there will consume from the cafeteria and that just adds to the budget. Better to let adults go in with a child. Don't get too greedy, your business is seasonal because during summer, most families wouldn't visit an indoor park...

Sign the waiver online before going, and make reservations for the busier days.

Review: We love Badlands so much! We’ve been coming here regularly since the weekend they opened and it’s continued to delight and entertain my children as they’ve grown. There’s always something new and interesting for them to do (today there was a drumming circle! How fun!)
As a parent, I love being able to kick back a bit here and relax while the kids play. I’m never worried they’re going to get out the door or taken by someone- I don't even get worked up when I lose sight of the toddler. There’s “security” at the door and a lot of staff around to help- I know my kids are safe even when I cant see them. This makes it a great place to come and do a bit of work or chat w friends while the kids get out some energy!

My single greatest complaint is actually just hovering parents. Hear me out- If you’ve ever been lucky enough to come to Badlands on a low key day, when all the parents are sitting at the cafe and the kids are running free- it’s incredible. You can sit w your laptop and see your kids almost wherever they are- bc there are no groups of grownups standing in the way blocking your view. There are staff all over the place to help keep kids safe on the play equipment- it’s an absolutely perfect environment to teach your kids some independence and allow them to take some risks.
Also, I wish they were open after school for a few hours! 😉

Review: Badlands is my all time favorite place to take kids.  I have 3 kids and I've been to Many places. They have teenagers on staff to keep an eye on the kids and to keep them engaged. The set up in it's own is inventive and encourages young curiosity. They have an indoor landscape of large climbable rocks and mountains, a faux forest with a maze of trees for kids to run through. A metal dome jungle gym, just like you would see on a playground is usually surrounded by climbing/hanging kids of all ages. The floor of the entire play area is padded, rocks, mountains, all of it. They have bleachers with large flat hand drums for the kids to play. They offer various  activities every hour. A loudspeaker let's you know what is happening and where to go in the room to participate. We even met an iguana during our last visit! There are many tables of various heights surrounding the play area. They offer all kinds of food and snacks, and drinks vary from almond milk to Chardonnay.
My grandson never wants to leave and I never have to stand up.  Bless you Badlands!

It was a true proud mommy moment and I am so thankful for the staff for their engagement with her, they were ever present in every space we explored but still gave the space my kiddos needed to feel independent! I definitely recommend you take advantage of the weekend workshops, it makes the space feel different every time you come and is a wonderful added value!

For older kids though, they can ride big slides, climb and do a variety of activities including lego.  They also offer classes you can sign up in advance.   Like other reviews say, since you have to pay for both kids and adults, it is more costly than other places.

It appears to be a pretty nice shopping mall play area with plenty of padding on the play elements.

Review: Scramble in Alexandria has been a wonderful part of our daughter’s early development. As a parent of an infant, finding a safe, clean, and engaging indoor play space is priceless—and Scramble delivers on all fronts. Our daughter absolutely loves coming here and lights up the moment we walk through the doors.

The toddler area is thoughtfully designed, with plenty of soft obstacles and supportive surfaces that helped her learn how to walk and safely explore her surroundings. The equipment is age-appropriate, clean, and well-maintained, which gives us peace of mind every time we visit.

One of the things that makes Scramble truly special is the staff. They are consistently warm, welcoming, and attentive. They even know our daughter by name, which speaks to the personal care and attention they give every family. I want to give a special shoutout to Ms. Cora—she’s truly the best! Her kindness and energy make every visit feel like a reunion with family.

We’re so grateful for Scramble. It’s not just a play place—it’s become a meaningful part of our daughter’s growth and joy.

Review: I am disappointed to have to leave a 2 star review for this establishment, but I feel as if I need to so other parents can have the same level of transparency I wish that I had seen before booking. I booked a large birthday party for my son’s first birthday party, which came out to be $680. To me, that’s a pretty penny so I presumed a certain standard came with that price tag. When I booked the party, I paid a deposit and was given standard information for the party such as what was allowed, what to expect, etc.

From the time I booked, to when the party was was about 3 weeks time. We tried SEVERAL times (upwards of 5-6) to reach out to this establishment and the sister establishment in falls church (it’s the exact same number) and each time we were greeted with a voice mailbox that was full so you couldn’t even receive a call back. We called on different days and different times of day in an attempt to get a call back, and to me, for $680, that’s unacceptable service.

We tried the best we could to answer our own questions and appease our guest’s questions until the party. When we got there, we were debriefed on rules and were advised that our party package only covered 15 kids and 15 adults. My fiancé asked the front desk lady why each child was only allowed 1 adult, when two parent households were fairly standard and all she could reply was “it’s only $4 extra dollars per adult”. Of course we were looking at her like she was crazy, because I hate to keep bringing up the price, but we paid a hefty sum and invited several families to this party just to be nickel and dimed about secondary parents that show up.

Of course the kids had a blast at this party. we had varying age ranges from 1-6 at this party. But one issue we noticed with the play areas is that they were separated by age. The small babies had an area in the front, and it age progressed as you went back. But there was no one managing any of the areas. Of course we had several one year old babies at my one year old’s party and there were several older kids playing in that area and it was extremely easy for your kids

to get hurt. They, of course, had the vultures walking around when it was time to leave to make sure certain colored bands were out of the play area when it was time to go, but no one to make sure kids stayed in the appropriate play areas.

My final qualm, was that the food came out around 3:20 and we were expected to be out of the room at 4 completely. If you’re a parent, you know kids eat slow especially when they need help or you have multiples. Our plan was to eat and then do the cake. The front desk lady came in around 4 and was making all this passive aggressive commentary about how 4 had passed already and we should’ve been gone. But she saw us actively shooing people out the door so we could pack everything up and leave.

Overall, I know that the kids had fun and the party was a hit. But I just feel like what I paid for, and what I got was not the same. Not having an open phone line is unacceptable, if you want people out on time, bring the food out earlier especially for small dependent children. And if you have the ability to police the band colors so people don’t play past their time, you can make sure big kids aren’t hurting little kids in their designated play area. All around, this is not a good birthday party spot for what you pay for, and I wouldn’t recommend it to my other parents.

Review: Happy to find an “adult-low sensory” play gym for my toddler. No loud music or flashing lights. I was not urgently trying to get out due to my senses being overstimulated.

I appreciate the separate play sections to keep all kids safe. The staff were very attentive to ensure the safety of all the kids.

This location was clean and the staff were friendly. And I like that a bunch of tables offered high chairs. There was a good variety of food and drink options- including wine and beer. The food was ok.

Review: Cora, Amber, and Toya are a part of an outstanding team here at the Scramble indoor playground. We are visiting from Washington State and we are staying in Washington, D.C. and we were looking for an indoor playground for our two kids because it was raining outside, luckily we found this place.
It surprised me how clean and kind the staff were and how amazing the selection for food they had for kids and adults. It was so cool the huge selection of adult beverages aswell as drinks for kids.

The kids had a great time in their jungle gym. They played for the whole 2 hours.

We recommend this place and will visit again.

Review: We love Scramble! My son (now 2) has been going regularly for more than a year. At first, the baby areas really helped him gain the confidence to walk, and now it is a safe, clean place where he can run and climb and get expend a LOT of energy. It is calmer, more manageable, more personable, and a better experience than the Hyper Kids, which we've also tried. Because we go so often, the staff know my son and always greet us by name and with a big smile. I want to particularly thank the manager, Cora, for creating such a stable, welcoming, and special experience for my son ❤️

Review: I visited Scramble Alexandria recently and left feeling deeply disappointed and disrespected.

When I arrived, I was surprised by the “holiday fee” — an increased admission rate I hadn’t noticed beforehand. I later went back and found the pricing on the website, but I still believe it’s poor business practice to double prices on the very days when hard-working parents, especially mothers like myself, finally have a little time to bring their kids out for fun. It feels like taking advantage of families who are doing their best to create special moments with limited time and resources.

When I expressed my concern about the fee at the front desk, the staff member, Cora, replied with, “You don’t have to let your children play here.” Her tone and response were rude, unprofessional, and completely dismissive of a valid concern.

To make matters worse, my son and goddaughter were wrongly accused of trying to throw a birthday party — simply because my goddaughter brought a small gift bag and one balloon on a stick to celebrate a pretend birthday for her stuffed animals. Instead of asking questions or treating us with respect, we were immediately confronted and made to feel like we were doing something wrong. It was embarrassing and unnecessary.

I followed up with an email to management to express my concerns and never received a response. The lack of communication and accountability speaks volumes.

Unfortunately, I won’t be returning. There are other indoor play options in the area where children can enjoy themselves and parents are treated with respect, not suspicion or indifference.

********Update: It is clear by the companies response there is no accountability. Mistreatment of customers is condoned; and a birthday hat on a stuffed animal is not allowed. PARENTS BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION. I’ve always had good experiences at Falls Church try there or one of the many other indoor playgrounds. Like Cora told me; “I don’t have to come there” and I won’t. 😊

Review: I went with my 14 month old and we had so much fun! It was 20$ for the two of us. The little kid area was distinct from the big kid area and the workers were good at telling the big kids to go back to their area. Very clean as well. While it was very busy it wasn’t crowded either and there was plenty of space for my little one to play safely. My only minor complaints are that while there was a good variety of food it wasn’t very good and was overpriced (20$ for two pretzels, some grapes and water)but  it was par for the course for a place like this. Additionally parents were leaving their bags on the tables intended for eating while they went to go play even though there was a designated bag area so after I ordered my food there was nowhere to sit. Staff should be more on people to not leave their items in the food area unless they’re actively sitting there. Overall a fun time and we will be coming again.

I would 100% recommend Scramble for your little ones. I wish I got the rude ones name because she should not be at the front desk or in any customer service positions.

I understand that there are rules but there is a way to explain them and the was she was explaining them was rude. Almost as if she was pre judging us because of the color of our skin. There wasn’t any issues with our party following rules. I simply requested to BUY shoe coverings for a 76 year old grandma attended the party. Again. I wish she took a better tone and the response to this review took accountability for her actions

Review: We celebrated my son’s birthday on the second week of December. We had a blast and everything went smooth. The staff, especially Toya and Cora were magnificent, I couldn’t have asked for a better group of ladies to run my son’s party. I would definitely book again and recommend for anyone, 12/10!

Special shout out to my daughter birthday 🎂 host Toya!!!!!! She was everything you could ask for in assisting and helping me take a load off!  I didn’t even book a party. But because we engaged and it was for my daughter birthday and I had few people, we enjoyed it !!!! Another special shout out to Cora and Michelle for the best customer service and generous hospitality!!! Thank you 🙏🏾 scramble for existing!

Review: Let me first start off by saying this is the cleanest and safest environment EVER. As a bystander a few weeks ago I noticed a gentleman come into this establishment disrespecting Cora who works here. I immediately felt bad and empathized with her and the other staff disrespected. Cora held her composure and took care of it excellently, I mean very professional. If this were my employee she’d be getting promoted! However the disrespect did not stop here, this man kept it going and all over a BEER. This is a kids establishment NOT a place for continuous drinking and not for you to disrespect ANY of this staff that works here. Im honestly disgusted that they even left a bad review playing victim and making this place seem unsafe when it is not. Nothing ever got physical and I was right there to see it. What happened was a grown man that was a bystander with respect for hard workers was not going to allow a disrespectful entitled man child to disrespect these workers as if their kids or below them. Obviously the man child didn’t take too well to that and caused commotion but hey, Not every bystander will let you disrespect hard working people. Even Alexandria Police Department agreed with the generous man that intervened on behalf of Cora and the other workers disrespected. You never go into a establishment treating people like that, EVER. In front of your own child acting like that is even more sad & embarrassing. Ever since this incident and seeing how great the staff is and handled the situation I come back all the time! Cora is amazing and I will always return to this location. The food, hospitality, and customer service is top notch. Please be mindful when you come here and show the staff respect always, these people make it possible for your kids to have fun while you catch a little break.

Review: We've visited this place multiple times over the past two years and have experienced it in various conditions. In June 2024, we saw positive improvements—the floors were replaced, equipment was repaired, and new toys were added. However, by December 2024, the facility had deteriorated significantly. The play area was filthy, with spilled Goldfish crackers and cheese stick wrappers scattered around. Equipment was covered in dust and fingerprints, the air was musty and humid, and several pieces of equipment were broken.

The bathroom conditions were particularly bad. The women's restroom needs a new soap dispenser, as excess soap drips onto the floor, creating a large puddle. Another dispenser has a sign stating it's clogged, which means both dispensers are unreliable. Additionally, the sock policy isn’t consistently enforced—some children play without socks, and kids frequently move balls from the ball pit into the building block area, creating a safety hazard since most children walk there.

To improve cleanliness and safety, I recommend that staff conduct hourly walkthroughs to pick up trash, vacuum dirty areas (including the shoe area), wipe down equipment, and organize toys. Broken balls and damaged building blocks should also be removed regularly. A deep cleaning at least once a year would help tackle dust buildup in hard-to-reach areas.

On the positive side, despite the broken equipment and cleanliness issues, we still manage to have fun here. We also appreciate the convenience of the available snacks and drinks.

In summary, this place has potential but suffers from inconsistent maintenance. When properly cleaned and maintained, it’s a great spot for kids to play. However, poor upkeep—especially in the play area and bathrooms—makes visits less enjoyable. Regular cleaning, better enforcement of policies, and occasional deep cleaning would make a huge difference. Some families have mentioned catching bugs after visiting, though we haven’t personally experienced that issue.

Review: One of the cleanest facilities like this in the area. Sometimes facilities like this can be neglected but this one seems to keep up it's cleaning routine. The play structures are solid. Some facilities seem to wake or away. This one is rock solid. Very well built. The plastic slide could use one or two more inner tubes. Other than that all the kids were having a blast. Only bad thing is your kids won't want to leave.

Review: We've been here afrw times. I bring my twins often, and have since they were 3 they are now 6. Over the years I guess the owner cares less and less about the place. The jungle gym itself is covered in dirt and dust (aka dead skin) of you stand at the entrance of the jungle gym and look at the top there are dust bunnies bigger than cat. The entire thing really needs a deep clean. It's also quiet until a kid hits the alarm and a awful drone sound begins that makes your head wana explode, this is the only place I've gone to that doesn't have music of somekind playing.  After today I do think this will be our last time going.

Review: We took our son a couple of times here.  In December 2024, after my husband took him there, my son got sick.  Gradually all of us got sick.  Again, I took my son here yesterday, then he got a cough and a lot of snot in the morning (my husband was the same because sleeping next to him )and then he became a fever then I did after. I think in this winter all germs are still around inside. They need to clean and sterilize/sterilize all of inside play areas.  Otherwise I can’t take my son anymore.  A friend of mine also said the same things.
To be honest every time we went, the stuff wasn’t nice.
But my son had so much fun here, was running all over. It’s nice place to play. That’s why I want them to go over / make sure.
Some spots are still broken. Like one of air balls didn’t work.
Should you do air circulation every day, sterilized some toys as well.

All you need is a dessert they supply litteraly everything else food,drinks cups, plates, tabel covers. It's only like $350 for all that and 10 kids or 20 for like 100 more nice size party room.  Super friendly staff, everything is clean. We go on rainy days sometimes it's pretty affordable they have a monthly pass also.

Review: My child is 2 years old and we have been here multiple times on weekdays.

My kid loves to play at the tot zone but there are always children older than 3 years old.
I have never complained about this, but during today's visit, two girls over 3 years old blocked the tot zone slide and kept my child away.
I didn't know where these children's parents were, and no one stopped them to do.

So I went to the front desk and asked, isn't the tot zone only available for children up to 3 years old, and the answer was ""everyone can get in.""
Then why did you write “Tot zone (ages 0 to 3) ” in big letters? Is it fair to inform consumers that there is a tot zone, but in reality anyone can get in there?

It was a very very disappointed experience.
I will never want to visit again.

Review: Came for a birthday party. We've never been here before. Very crowded and loud so it makes it difficult to hear them announce over the intercom when it's time for your party to go have cake and pizza. Very limited places for parents to sit which is bad if you have a bad back like myself. Very disorganized hosts, too. When we first arrived, we told them that we were new and here for a birthday party and the hostess didn't give us any information as to how this place works...basically winging it as I sit here and type. I had to come up and ask if we could finally enter beyond the gated area
Also, the kids all got separated and we're playing separately because it was so crowded. Never coming back! Place seems very clean, though. UPDATE: We missed the party because we couldn't hear the name of our host being called. Terrible! I miss Hopper's in Eldersburg!

Review: Have taken our grandkids to this place several times. We went there a few days ago and we will not be going back. The place is filthy. You can smell the dust just sitting there and  the floors are disgusting. When I spoke to the attendant, I was told that they’re going to clean it up sometime after memorial day that they were working on a new place in Virginia. I suggest to the owners that you learn how to maintain what you have before you start a new venture. you will also find that you will lose customers a whole lot faster than you got them.

Some of the electronic features have been broken seemingly for months, there is debris accumulating between play spaces, and there is general evidence the owners and staff don't care, e.g. the foam legos break often as noted by the pile of broken and tossed aside bricks in a makeshift storage area clearly visible immediately adjacent to the play space. Parents check out and let their kids climb slides and run over younger kids, often even in the toddler play space. Again, no staff is visible maintaining any space or ensuring safety for all. Bottom line: it's a gross indoor playground that is falling apart with indifferent owners and staff.

Review: I used to give this indoor playground a 5 star. Today, I brought my three kids and as I entered, the air was musty. It was crowded and the a/c setting was in the 70s! The area now is very dirty. The bathroom is nasty. The 2 staff are cocky when I asked for the air quality to be improved because it is crowded and the air wasn't circulating at all they werent interested to make the change until I asked to talk to the owner. They only gave me an email to contact not the phone of the onwer. They weren't opening the doors to let out the musty air and let fresh aowner. One of the staff sprayed an air freshener instead which is not very healthy to mix with a non circulating air. One of my kids is allergic to air freshner to make matters worse. The floors are dirty and not swept and not mopped clean. This place used to be sanitized, clean and fresh but the condition today was below average. The bathroom was dirty and stinky. I had to keep going outside to get some fresh air because the air quality is giving me a lot of headache already. I hope this improves as we really love to support local businesses in our town.

Review: I was excited about this as I had heard from a friend her son had loved it. The front desk girls seemed annoyed or inconvenienced that they had to check us in. So very disheartening first impression. I will say my 2 yr old had a blast, but it was quite dirty and lots of the ball machines were broken or not working at the time.

Review: Hello

I decided to take my kids there about two weeks ago, when we got there the front desk was bothered that we were trying to check in and pay. I brushed it since it was raining and the place was super packed. I noticed that the place needed a few repairs.  I decided to go pack this weekend and the repairs are still not have been completed. I check google and there been many complains about this .

Review: Comparable to Bubala and could even be better than Bubala if the facility was better maintained; many of the sections were broken (and remain broken since we've returned). It seems like this place does very well so I do not understand why repairs haven't taken place. Not to mention, every time we've gone, the restrooms are incredibly dirty. I realize it's a busy place, but all the more reason for frequent cleaning. Lastly, and maybe this is just a peeve, but the storage in between the playpens with the unsightly boxes and whatever else just reaffirms the carelessness for appearance. I do get that it's an indoor children's playground (aka madhouse) but folks are paying a lot of money for their children to play here. All in all, my children did have fun but my toddler was very frustrated that only one ball tube worked. I'm sure we'll be back but not as often as they'd like; a bit pricey when you consider the above.

My daughter still had a blast but I definitely don’t think we will go back anytime soon due to the condition of that place.

Review: Quality of staff has lowered significantly; we went today at a quiet time and the girl behind the desk had to take her headphones off just to check us in where we weren’t asked for our information or to sign a waiver. The second employee was just reading a book. I wouldn’t see this as an issue, but when we told them that a child had tracked blood throughout the playground, it took a good bit of time for them to actually get up with a disinfectant wipe and wipe the immediately obvious spots without doing a complete walkthrough of the entire facility. This poor cleaning standard is reflected throughout the facility as there is an easily visible thick layer of dust on just about every surface that can’t be reached without a step stool. The storage of extra materials under the equipment is understandable and a strong effort is made to keep children from these areas, but the amount of dust and random socks/trash under there could definitely be fixed.

Along with the lack of investment in time to clean, there doesn’t seem to be much investment into up keeping the equipment. I’m sure it’s expensive to repair and maintain, but some things really should be prioritized. I saw safety nets that are torn and tied together with string, many of the seams are tearing on everything, the tubes for the slides are deflated, and the one attraction that allows you to spin the inner ring has been duct taped so many times that where the tape has worn there is exposed metal.

We used to have a great time here, I’m not quite sure what happened!

Review: This place is amazing with young kids. Lots of activities to do from slides to climbing through wire nets and ball pits. Great for birthday parties. My only issue is with ventilation, last time we went it was very humid inside due to all the sweat and warmth of so many people and kids running around inside and you could smell the sweat. The owners should either limit the number of people or do something about the ventilation.

There's minimal if any staff walking around the playground so expect to police your children and check on them once in a while if you weren't already going to do that.

Review: Our previous visits to Me land were enjoyable, but our most recent experience on Saturday, Jan 20th was disappointing. I'm saddened to say that the place was absolutely filthy, adults were not being supervised not that they should need but it seems that common sense is not so common for some people as they had their shoes on in the play area dragging all the melted snow and dirt from outside. Not only was the floor dirty, there were big hairballs, napkins, water bottles and all kinds of trash all over the place. I approached the employees and kindly asked if someone could pick up the trash on the play area,  there were four employees standing at the register, one of them say they will and never did, we stay an hour and not one single employees picked any of the trash or asked the people with shoes to take them off. Also, the same employees were wearing the shoes inside the area. It is a shame that such a nice place turned into a filthy area. A suggestion for improvement would be to consider getting better employees or implementing effective management to ensure a cleaner and more pleasant environment. I'll be happy to change my review once issues have been addressed.

Review: I visited Joyland on 7-1 with my 3 children ages 1, 5, and 8.

Pros:
1. Great location
2. Lots of parking
3. Very clean facility and bathrooms

Cons

1. Young girl working was on her phone as she completed my transaction and answered my questions. It’s nothing more rude than when young people have their AirPods in and are holding two conversations at once. There were times when she was looking at me but talking on her phone.
2. It was 78 degrees inside on a  95 degree day. Their air was set to 64 degrees. I don’t know if it was ventilation issues or AC issues but it was hot. You are not allowed to bring food or drinks inside. They have water fountains but they are near the bathroom (I don’t drink water fountains near bathrooms iykyk) They have a water bottle refill station but you can’t bring bottles in so it doesn’t really make sense.
3. Their price per child no matter what their age, is $15.99 for 2 hours. One adult does enter free with children. There is no different price for younger ages which was shocking to me. HyperKidz and Scramble even have a different price for toddlers vs older children. They also don’t have different weekday prices vs weekend prices.  Paying $16 for a space where my one year old could not even use half of the equipment was unsettling.
4. The space is small. It is the size of the surrounding businesses. I was so happy to have a place close to home but for $16 per child I will take my kids where it is half the price and they actually have more things to do.
5. They require non slip socks. Every indoor playground I have been to requires socks but not non slip socks. The non slip socks are a money grab. They look similar to the sky zone socks but nothing in there is slippery so I really didn’t understand the non slip socks. As I looked around almost every family had them which confirmed for me it was a money grab. Their website also didn’t have the socks under their admissions tab.

I will not be coming back. I really wanted to support a new black owned business but it seems like a money grab for the size and what they have to offer.

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

Everyone working there is so friendly and nice, and they do whatever they can do to help you, always with a smile, have a great time, and feel comfortable. My grandson's birthday was there this past week, and everyone had a great time. They made his birthday special. Thank you Cabin Fever!!! I  definitely recommend them!

Review: Our favorite place to go when the weather was hot, cold, rainy, snowy, overcast, sunny, or cloudy. We moved last month and my daughter still talks about it daily. So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Review: I held my daughters 3rd birthday here today. Me and my family have been here one other time, and were completely SOLD. Today just sealed the deal! Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: It's an awesome, clean,  family owned play place.. there are physical activities and quiet-time activities.  The physical activities include : probably 10 different swings, mini workout gear perfect for big 2 year olds (treadmill, stairmaster, stationary bike and 3 others) , zip line, net for climbing , ""rock climb"" type wall, monkey bars, a decent sized enclosed trampoline and last but not least, a zip line. The only thing that annoys me is that most of the battery operated toys no longer work , so my daughter wastes her time trying to play with them. I think it would be much more professional if they removed (dead) battery operated toys  as they are annoying and an eye sore.
There is also a low lit calm/quiet room for children that may need it. There is also hang out for teenagers upstairs , it has a couch and table and chairs along with board games (although ""Words With Friends "" was missing several pieces, a large connect four , kid safe darts and an air hockey table. They have a cute exclusive Melissa & Doug toy boutique.

We had our 7 year old’s birthday party here, and everyone (mostly kids without autism) had a fantastic time.  I was worried that 7 and 8 year olds might be too old for this place, but they LOVED it.  The owners are super helpful and accommodating.  Unlike most party locations, WRTS was free of frustrating rules and fees, which made planning our event much more pleasant.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Review: We understood that this is a place specialized in children with autism/on the spectrum to paraphrase their name. I took my son with me when I decided to enroll him in their camp. I also had his nanny available to help out. Despite the mentioned the camp was a disaster. Overcrowded. They did not know how to handle my son. They did not allow the adult accompanying my son to use the bathroom and they expected the nanny to take care of my son despite the fact that they were paid to take care of my son. Unfortunately this is a place I will NOT recommend to anyone. Unprofessional from the beginning to the end and also ran by ignorant quasi professionals.

Review: We just visited this morning. If you come before noon you can get a discounted rate. My son has multiple sensory issues, but the place is fairly quiet and he was able to play! When he first walked into the room he took time to orient himself. Then he discovered the zip line and that's all he wanted to do lol.
We last 30 minutes which I consider a success.  On the way out we shopped their gift section which has a variety of Melissa and Doug items. They have dress-up costumes, puzzles, play food, coloring and paint pads. It's a good selection, if you don't want to run to a big store then this is a convenient place to grab a kids gift.
Overall our experience was a positive one. They do have an upper floor for older kids with an air hockey table, giant Connect Four and other fun games. We'll come back and explore that more on our next visit.
Oh one more thing, there is a sweets store a few doors down. I don't remember the exact name but there is chocolate and other sweet treats.

It's full of toddler fascinating toys and big swings that allow you to play and have a great time with your kids.  The owners make us feel welcome every visit.  We recently held a birthday party here and all the visiting parents enjoyed the fun filled play space for the kids.  There was something for the 1 yr olds to the 9 year olds.  Everyone had a blast.  The owners really came through with suggestions for how to make a great party and they were very supportive through the event.

Review: Ok, so it is loud.  And a little chaotic.  But the sound feels like joy and the chaos bubbles over with normalcy.  Marketed as a ""Place Where You Never Have to Say I’m Sorry"", a mission which brought me to tears the first time I read it - as any care-giver of a special needs child will understand.  WRTS lives up to its mission and then some.

Review: As a child psychologist, I highly recommend Rock the Spectrum.  This is a much needed and wonderful place for children on the Autistic Spectrum, and for children with other neuro-developmental challenges -- ADHD, SPD, etc, and I'm so glad that it's right here in Loudoun County!  All children need to release energy productively, and the setting and activities at We Rock the Spectrum provides special needs children the positive and accepting space to work on sensory, emotional regulation and social skills.  This is a great place for your child to have fun, strengthen challenges and make new friends, and I've seen the successful impact first hand.

Review: Today I decided to take my kids to a play area for the first time since moving to SOMD and I was so glad I picked this place. I was curious to see if it lived up to its 5 star reputation & it did! I have a 6 year old, 22 month old, & 11 month old & they all had a blast! This place is VERY clean - there’s even a “germ bucket” for items my littlest decided to shove in his mouth so they can clean these items later! The price is great too. If it wasn’t for my kiddos getting tired we would’ve stayed there longer than 2 hours. It was worth the 1+ hour drive from SOMD. We’ll be back soon!

It is great place to bring your kids when the weather is inclement. You can spot your kid really easily and the other parents are cool. This place works with schools for fundraisers and also does reservations for birthday parties and it is awesome.

This place really impressed us.  The owner was so sincere and nice to everyone and helped kids out in the play area.  There was a lot to do for all ages and definitely a great place for special needs kids as well.  Clean, lots of space, lots of swings, a slide, a small zip line and lots of other things to do!

They have different areas for different age groups. They even have a calm room for people that get overwhelmed. My brother loved it and I loved the environment.

Review: We attended We Rock the Spectrum's open house. It was GREAT! I have a 7 year old with autism, and a neuro-typical 4 year old. My friend that has a 4 year old with autism was also with us. There was plenty of stuff for both of my kiddos to do! At the open house the floors were slippery, however I talked to the owner that evening and they had already dewaxed the floors and were putting down more rugs (less than 12 hours after the open house closed, the saw a problem and fixed it immediately)! In the gym area there is a thick foam mat to keep the kiddos safe, most of the toddler area has the same thick foam mat, and the small area that doesn't have the foam mat has colorful, soft rugs.  I haven't been back since the fixed the floors, however I would recommend raking non-skid socks if you have them, just incase. For us it was worth the almost 45-minute drive! They have a Facebook page you can check out that has more reviews and lots of pictures to give you an idea of all they have to offer!}","Virginia","werockthespectrumloudounva.com",,"20164"

Review: It’s clean and well maintained and I feel safe when my kids are here because staff don’t allow kids to leave the play area without their adult. The parties are run efficiently and even if you come on a weekend morning it’s not overly crowded. The staff keep it orderly and make sure kids aren’t being left to run wild and big kids aren’t monopolizing little kid areas. We’ve been coming here for years and it’s gotten even better with time. Staff like Ms. Natasha are friendly and vigilant.

Review: Staff was knowledgeable and courteous. The place was clean. Our visit was short, the playground was not busy.

I was disappointed that a kid opened the playground entrance/exit gate without her parent to get water, then her parent came. It shouldn’t be that easy to get out (the main entry doors were propped open and very easy for a kid to slip out) or an employee should be at that gate ALWAYS when kids are in the playground.

Review: This is a great place if you have kids multiple ages. The facility is big enough that they can all play in the different areas, but not so large that you can't keep your eyes on them. The staff is excellent and on top of ensuring the entrance/exit policy! The facility is very clean. You can bring in your own food and they have limited snacks for sale.

Review: Elif made our son's birthday party a 5 star experience. I would strongly encourage parents to request her to be the coordinator. She literally put our whole party together in the room, took photos for us, and helped keep the kids excited from one event to the next. We had a 12:30 party on Sunday and the first hour it was pretty empty - so seemed like a private party. Definitely a happy surprise to find how easy hosting a party at Jolly Yolly was, especially due to Elif's help!

Review: I was first introduced to Jolly Yolly through a party my girls were invited to 2yrs ago. After that my eldest insisted on having her party there and then my youngest the following year. Although they had fun I was not impressed by their handling of the party it was disorganized and left myself and husband scrambling to get everything coordinated. This year my youngest requested a Spiderman themed party at Jolly Yolly....I cringed but wanted to make her happy.

Oh boy was I pleasantly surprised! My host Daniella was amazing in every way you can imagine! She took all decor and decorated in a fantastic manner. She made sure to make everything run on time and checked in with me periodically. She helped me navigate awkward moments with my guests. She did this by asking how I would like to handle it and following instructions; when I didn't have an answer/was unsure she took charge and handled the situation with grace!

At the end Janeen (the manager) took my payment and even that was a pleasant experience. She was genuinely interested in my experience which ment a lot to me!

This was a dream team and I can't wait to go back with my girls!

Review: This place was okay, I guess. For $12 for my child I can't really complain. I'm not driving out of my way and here's why.

The toys were really beat up. A lot of them were broken and gunked up. Some of these inflatables were on the flat side. I was too worried of an injury to let my son go on.

There's a almost tree house looking area with a house at the top of stairs. This is crazy dangerous. One side has steep and sharp stairs. The other side is to climb up, but if someone falls it will be a serious injury.

Also, one area in the ball pit has the beam exposed without pad. It's a very small area, but that can cause a serious injury.

To me, this place isn't putting safety and cleanliness first. There seems to be a lack of care.

While it was a decent spur of the moment place when we were in town, I would not return here.

Review: We had a party here and while it was nice to have to not worry about set up and clean up, overall the party room is in rough shape as well as the tablecloths. There’s a $40 service fee that was explained as a “tip” for the person attending. We were also told there were juice boxes included for the kids which we didn’t get. Not a huge deal but for the price we paid and the fact that we were charged $30 for a couple of extra kids that were there but were 8 month olds who didn’t even play, that was kind of annoying. The equipment to play on is fun and the kids enjoyed it. Overall it worked well for what we needed at the time but for $600, I wouldn’t do it again.

Review: This play area was fantastic ten years ago, but it’s now in poor shape. The toys are old, dirty, and ripped, and the space is clearly neglected. Management needs to invest in cleaning, repairing, and updating the equipment to bring it back to its former quality and make it safe for the kids. It was a really sad and disappointing visit since I had such great memories with my older kids. Only pro is that it’s not a massive indoor play area so you don’t have to run after your kids to find them.

Review: I went with a kid who cannot yet walk (13 months). This felt more like a pre-school instead of a play space (groups of little toys, some of them broken). The baby area was very small, just a 5ftx5ft fenced in area with lots of battery toys, so much so that I had to move things to have space to sit down.
There is a large climbing structure and blow-up obstacle course for older children. We didn't get a chance to try it out since it was rather busy that day.

There is a bouncy slide that is off on its own. There are also several small spaces with benches and smaller play things if the kids want a break from the big stuff. It's also helpful for smaller kids. I believe there is also a VERY small enclosed space specifically for toddlers with toys.

I haven’t seen before and we celebrated so many times in that facility,that someone can be that rude.

She is pushing a group to finish event and room is rented for two hours.

Plus, the room is never cleaned and prepared for the event.

Review: So well organized for kids of ALL ages from infant to 14. A very very clean place and so much fun because you can play with your kids for the price of your child’s admission! It makes it easier to plan weekly trips here all things considered. They offer snacks as well as water for the kids for a small fee. Very fun and lots to do and the safety is unmatched. During the week never have to worry about an over capacity either it’s almost a private feeling. They offer private bookings for $100 or so dollars bring the kids here for their birthday party you won’t be disappointed and you can truly relax without having to look over your shoulder or hawk eye ur kids because it’s set up in such a safe way for all the kids especially infants. This is our new go to!

Review: The place is super small. When we asked questions, the woman at the front desk, I’m not sure if she’s the owner or just a worker, was super rude and impatient. Not at all what you expected from someone working at a kid’s place. She also ignored us and was on her phone when we walked in and the first thing she said was to buy socks, not even a greeting or a welcome. I don’t recommend this place because of the customer service, plus there aren’t a lot of things for the kids to do. They got bored after a while.

I’m very disappointed that a place that is supposed to be happy and fun has such a mean person working there. There are so many other places around to go to with a much more friendly environment. Don’t waste your money here.

They keep the place very clean, there aren't too many people there if you go during the school day, and they have a nice little seating area with tables where you can sit, eat a snack or get some work done while the kids play. I especially like it, because while there are so many different activities for the kids to stay entertained for hours, the place is fairly small and so it's easy to keep track of where your little one is at all times.

Review: I didn’t come here for a party. It was just a play date, and I really wanted to like this place because the kids had an amazing time. But I can’t overlook the condition of the facility.

Everything about the place feels old, dingy, and unsanitary. Several play structures were literally held together with duct tape. The ball pit had balls with missing foam or foam completely exposed. There’s also a slide that goes straight down into a pole, which doesn’t seem like the safest design.

What really pushed me over the edge was the bathroom. The smell hit me the second I opened the door. It smelled like urine that had been sitting for days. Toilet paper was all over the floor, and not a single surface felt clean enough to touch. I couldn’t even bring myself to walk in. It was just too disgusting. 🤢

If management put some effort into repairs and basic cleaning, this could be a great spot for kids. But until that happens, I won’t be coming back. You’re better off going to Hyper Kidz or Chuck E. Cheese.

Review: This place is basically the Dollar Tree version of Hyper Kidz. The entire setup looks like it’s being held together with Scotch tape. Everything felt dingy, worn down, and just tired.

The girl at the front desk had the customer service energy of someone at the DMV, not exactly welcoming or helpful.

The equipment? Faded, patched-up, and dirty, and don’t let the bright colors fool you, nothing felt clean, safe, or well-maintained. If this is your first time here, make it your last. Matter of fact.. Save your money.

Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks at a real indoor play center. Your kids deserve better.

Review: We had my niece’s birthday party at Play EC in Capitol Heights. The kids had a great time on the jungle gym and play areas, but the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The party room wasn’t available until 4 p.m. even though the party was scheduled for 2:30, which was frustrating. The space is small and felt overcrowded on a busy Saturday.

It was hot inside, especially in the back where the air doesn’t circulate well. The facility could be cleaner—dust triggered my allergies, and there were items stored under the jungle gym. Staff seemed limited—only three people on site, including the manager.

They did provide pizza, juice, and handled setup, and the decor was nice, though clearly reused. Be careful with helium balloons—if one floats to the ceiling, they’ll charge up to $150 to retrieve it or you can risk your safety and try to get it down yourself, they will provide the ladder for you.

It’s probably best to go during a weekday or rent the full space if you’re planning a party. Great for kids, but not the most comfortable for adults.

Review: SCAMMERS!!!
We booked a birthday party at this establishment for 5:30 PM and paid $600 in advance, as required. However, we arrived at 5:47 PM and were shocked to find that we had to wait nearly two hours for a party room to become available. Despite paying for a private room for two full hours, we were not given access to a room until 7:30 PM. To make matters worse, the manager informed us that we had to vacate by 7:45 PM—after receiving only 15 minutes of use.

The experience was completely unacceptable. The pizza provided was cold, and the drinks were old Capri Sun juice boxes. This is not what we paid for, and certainly not what was advertised.

As a Black woman supporting a Black-owned business, I expected professionalism, respect, and accountability. Unfortunately, this experience confirmed why many hesitate to support our own—because some businesses treat paying customers as if their money and time don’t matter. I feel disrespected, disappointed, and frankly scammed out of $600 for a service that was never properly delivered.

For comparison, Chuck E. Cheese charges $200 less and honors their time slots. Even if you arrive late, they simply deduct that time from your reservation—they don’t force you to wait two hours for a room you already paid for.

This business failed to meet basic expectations and left my family and guests feeling disregarded. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously so that no other family has to go through what we experienced.

Big kids were running over the little ones, and I almost had to intervene in a fight between two boys who looked to be around 13. I didn’t see any staff on the floor enforcing the rules.

Review: I’m giving this place one star solely because my child enjoyed coming here BEFORE we booked a party. However, I can confidently say this is not a 4-star establishment—don’t be misled by Google reviews. Many of the honest 1-star reviews can be found on Yelp.
The management is unprofessional, greedy, and show no appreciation for their guests. My party décor was nothing like what I requested, and both the party host and management were rude and dismissive. After the event, I sent a polite and professional email regarding my deposit, only to receive nothing but disrespect and unprofessional back-and-forth responses, as if I were arguing with a child.
They claim they’ve made “upgrades”—absolutely not. The facility still smells like feet, the foam pit cubes are falling apart and unsanitary, and to top it off, the entire place reeked of weed as we were leaving. They don’t have enough staff to monitor guests, so anyone can come and go freely, creating a safety concern.
Despite advertising that the space is for kids 8 years and younger, there were older, rough-playing kids who posed a risk to younger children. They also claim to provide waivers and wristbands for safety, but that wasn’t enforced at all.
To make matters worse, the candy wall décor contained old, stale, and hard candy—and this was during my party!
If you're considering booking a party here, think twice. They make up their own rules, have no regard for customer satisfaction, and will take your money without delivering the promised experience. I truly regret spending my hard-earned money here and not receiving my deposit back. Beware before booking! I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: It was so crowded and so many children over the age of 8 on the equipment around toddlers I saw one baby bust his lip because he got pushed by the whale swings and landed right in front of the slides while someone was coming down 😢, I came to celebrate my baby’s 2 birthday frozen theme they didn’t use my balloons just the previous party balloons for the garland, It was unorganized, late for party reservations and then rush you out the room, play area unsanitary and old, not worth the money $580 I’m going to see if I get my $150 deposit back like they said and then I’ll be back to inform you guys on that…I gave a 2 star because I loved the room setting in the party room and because I came here before on a week night and nobody was here so it was a beautiful and amazing experience for my 2 year old I live close by and I’ll still take her to get her sleepy for bed but i highly doubt I will do another party

Update: I received my $150 deposit and they called to get a better of my issues so that it won’t happen again in the future… and again it’s a nice place on the weekday for children under 8 years old thank you

Glad I didn't, because it was already at capacity. The party host was lazy and couldnt answer any of our concerns. The pizza we received was cold and looked like they dropped it on the floor. There was no manager in sight and no one answered any of my calls or texts until weeks later and even then the best they could offer was passes to come back! I would never patronize this place!

EC means early childhood and that is 8 and under. Huge children that were bigger than me on the equipment. I watched something break. Then parents are belligerent trying to provoke fights. Yelling and cursing at you if you go to management simply to tell them their equipment broke because they didn’t see. Not coming back.

My grandson is two and highly enjoys going to this place.  It's Maryland's best kept secret. The only con is that when they have birthday parties, there are sometimes older children who attend. They're too big for the play area and it's already a small space. In my opinion, it takes away from the younger children being able to fully immerse themselves in the space. When they do birthday parties, maybe they should consider charging for a few hours to rent out the entire space just for the party and close it off to the public until the party is over. The last time I was there with my grandson , it was a mixture of party goers and outside kids and it was a mess. The other children who are not a part of the party are left out and see the party favors and set up and are limited to their play time but the party kids have access to it all. This causes confusion. Other than that , it's a great place to take younger kids maybe 2-6 to play.

Review: I Had My Son 1ST Birthday Party here last Saturday And  We Had, an Amazing Experience here. My Party Coordinator was Philomina, and she provided me and my family Phenomenal Customer Service  Experience from the beginning to the end, as well as all the staff in the facility, was wonderful as well.

I definitely will be bringing my kids back for some fun. By the way the facility, was clean and I didn’t have any issues with them being full of capacity.

Don’t believe the comments or what someone else say book your child birthday party here, if you follow the rules and read before booking then you won’t have any issues!!

Review: My wife took the kids there to play because it was raining and couldn't go to six flags instead. Initially my oldest had to use a bathroom but wasn't planning on playing there but since our middle child started to run around and jump around a bit the front desk came up and demanded that we pay for our kids. We thought ok that's fine since our middle started to play but they demand that we pay full price for our youngest too... My youngest is only 10 months old. So service from this place is trash.
Next from the pictures it seems big but don't let it fool you, I guess because it was raining the place was packed, to the point where the kids could barely move around. We felt as if they had definitely over packed this place and didn't follow the max occupancy just to an extra buck.
Lastly the place is nasty, I don't know when was the last time they cleaned this place or even if it's been clean at all. Not to mention the smell of some illicit substance. I don't know if they have someone using that in the bad or what but we can definitely smell it. So overall this place is not worth the $15 per child. Customer service sucks, over crowded, and the place is filthy and smells. So I would pick another place to take your kids.
Last thing I want to mention I don't know if there was a change of ownership but if you look at most of the recent reviews they are all 1 star vs the review from 2 years ago. Food for thought.

Review: Paying $400 for a party here is honestly not worth it at ALL. you get 2 hours but only allowed in the room for 40 mins. so basically youre paying $400 for 40 mins in a room, a backdrop of the theme, 3 pizzas , some juice, paper plates and napkins. you can spend the same amount throwing your own party at home with MORE stuff literally.My main problem was I booked & paid for a specific room & they did not give me the room i paid for. Instead gave it to another party & gave me a completely different room. Some of the equipment needs maintenance or to be fixed. They have nets that are completely RIPPED OPEN, where a child can literally fall through it & hurt themselves.

I booked in hopes of a painless birthday but the description doesn’t match what really going to happen if you book at 2-5 you aren't able to access the room until 3pm which is dumb because the site states if you want  additional time to book an extra hour this place is money hungry like the comment state run!!!

Review: Went to a Birthday party there yesterday, Everything was like a 50/50 good/bad experience .
They had him in a little corner behind the trampoline with little to no light. The setup was adorable with the little cute chairs they had. The pizza was delicious but the environment could use better sanitation they could improve this by just having ppl purchase their socks instead. They should also start looking at replacing some of their stuff in there as they are getting worn out.

Despite the mess I've seen my kids enjoyed themselves and I had to drag my youngest out lol

It's limited space so mentally prepare yourself parents cause at some point it will annoy you. I can see in better weather I would just leave my stuff in the car.  There are seats for adults nearby to watch your kids as you should.

Review: Horrible experience for me! $400 for 40 minutes in a private space.  The place is very crowded and they over book! The workers don’t let you into your room until a hour later after your scheduled time. They interrupt your room to take down decorations more than 20 minutes before the time is up. Snatched table clothes off the table while babies are eating.  Very unprofessional. Don’t bring your kids here you will highly regret! THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION based on MY experience, do what you please

Review: I attended a party for my niece today and I was completely dissatisfied with the customer service. Not only was the party booked and paid for from 2-4 , we could not access the party room until 3. We had to quickly set up and around 3:30 the workers started taking the table cloths, and backdrop while we were still celebrating. This day was supposed to be about celebrating my niece but we were quickly rushed out. The workers were rude, and unorganized and I truly didn’t appreciate them cutting the party short. I will no longer attend here, and it’s disheartening to see a business run like this.

Review: Upon arrival, we were directed into the paly area for our 1 of paly time. In your disclosure your company states that you “provide a safe and stimulating environment for kids 8 and under to explore because we truly believe that growing up should be a memorable experience for every child.”. However, this was NOT the case on Sunday, there were multiple kids above the maximum age and weight limit who were filliping, spinning diving and jumping of the equipment and bumping into my one and two year old babies. The children were unsupervised and there was no staff to regulate play. I had to step in and stop rough play to keep my party’s babies safe. The condition and cleanliness of the equipment and play area was also unsanitary, unsafe, and broken. There was an event of a child vomiting (which is normal due to running around) however the facility did not have the proper cleaning supplies to aid the mess. There weren’t any trash bags, no disinfectant, no clothes, no mop nothing that could sanitize the area to continue play. My family and I had to help clean the entire surface area because of the short staffing. Even after surface cleaning, we had to continue to encourage shutting down that specific area due to lack of disinfectant treatment to that area. When directed back to our party room there was a walkway full of cake, water and just spilled the entire walkway, all my guest and children walker in socks and were subject to stepping in the filth on the ground. The “Swiffer used to clean the walkway after it was brought to staffing attention was not efficient as it did not have the proper size cleaning pad.  The rest rooms were unsanitary and had food and trash everywhere. The facility was not cleaned regularly during playtime.

During the celebration in the party room, we were not provided“ trained party host to ensure a stress-free experience” as stated in the companies. There were not enough napkins, plates, no utensils for the guest. All of which had to be retrieved upon consistent requests. The chairs and tables were filthy, torn and not in presentable condition. I cannot stress enough the lack of staffing we experienced at this facility. I was under the impression that there would be a capacity limit at which I know were not carefully monitored because the individuals in my party as well as incoming guest were not accounted for. The “memorable, safe, clean and courteous” environment promised for the amount myself and husband had to pay for our daughter wasn’t not delivered at this facility. My daughters first birthday experience as well as our guest was ultimately ruined.

NEVER AGAIN, OVERPRICED UNPROFESSIONAL AND BEYONG FILTHY.

Review: Staff was pleasant. Location was small. Pretty dirty everywhere I looked (I went through all the attractions b4 my kid to inspect) all the extra toys were old and grimy.
Kids had an ok time but they got bored really quick. This place is pretty much for babies and toddlers so don’t take any child over 3

Since My original review this place has STEPPED THEIR GAME UP! I’ll be honest, I only re-visited because it’s cheap and was still somewhat entertaining for my 1 & 4 yr olds.
But I was pleasantly surprised when we did🫶🏾
Way more attractions and much cleaner than before. They had newer toys and better snacks even. I’m happy to continue supporting this business because they seem like they are taking the upkeep of their facilities more seriously now. Thank you 🙏🏾

I only gave 4 stars because there is a support beam in the middle of the room that they positioned a tall slide right in front of😬😅
The slide itself is a 3 seater so the beam only blocks one. I just make sure my children don’t use that slide because it’s dangerous.
The inertia built up (even by a kid) coming down that thing could legit snap a neck😳

Other than that though perfect for a night of “letting them tire themselves out”
👌🏾

Review: I had my granddaughters 1st birthday at this facility and it was poorly kept. The toys had dirt marks on them, were they were poorly maintained and hadn't been cleaned in awhile. The bathroom for the general crowd hadn't been cleaned and smelled horrible. The bathroom that was in the party room (which the young lady at the front desk escorted us only. I thought she was the hostess as well, but i guess you dont get one) was full of tissue and feces. So we had no bathroom to use. It wasn't safe as well because one of the slides had a pole at the end of the slide, so you would slide right into it. Unsafe and poorly maintained.

Review: Last weekend I drove to the drive through menu board and said hello with no response. It took what seemed like a long time but eventually a young man answered. It seemed he must have been awake all night. I ordered an egg and cheese bagel and a medium Diet Coke. When I got home they had given me an egg and cheese biscuit instead. Disappointed but okay.

A short time ago I ordered the same thing an egg and cheese bagel and a medium Diet Coke. The same young man helped me. After paying I looked at my receipt and he had charged me for the wrong thing and overpaid. I decided to go inside and get the difference refunded to me. I had my order untouched and the receipt showing what I was charged. The young lady told me she couldn’t help me unless I had proof. As it seems my receipt wasn’t good enough and she said that she needed to see my bank statement showing the transaction. SERIOUSLY! At this point I wasn’t giving up and turned into the ugly customer until I was made whole. Eventually the only thing that was offered to me was the difference and not the $7.63 I paid. In my book because it was their mistake and we’re only talking 7 dollars a company wanting to make the customer happy should have offered me a full refund. Lesson learned never going back!

Review: We had a LOT of fun here! We spent HOURS here eating, chatting while my nephew played in the Play Place. It's even big enough for some more nimble adults to climb up into, which we did and let me tell you, its SUPER fun up there! There are little nooks to hide in , slides on multiple levels, and the spiral one is REALLY FAST!! There are things to roll on and hang on, and things I definitely cannot do. It's like a super fun playhouse with different areas and levels to play in and on. The thing you can roll on is a little iffy because someone could roll off it a little too fast and hit their head, but that's my only concern. The door to the area is heavy which prevents kids from escaping. There are about 10 or 15 different tables to sit/eat at and there's a bathroom right in the area so you don't need to leave for potty breaks. They do kiddo birthday parties in there for a very reasonable price. I recommend this place for a rainy day or anytime really. And check out my ADORABLE  nephew with his mom and her bf! Isn't he CUTE??? I meant my nephew, lol😝

Review: I would give this five 🌟 and I know it's not their fault but my mom made me leave before I was actually done playing, so that's the reason for taking away the first star. The reason for the second star, even though it's not completely their fault for it happening, is still worse than the first star. So, there I am all the way at the top when my mom said it was time to go so, being a good boy, I figured I would take the slide since it's faster. With all the other mom's and little kids there to see, I got stuck in the slide. Another boys mom said that it was because of me being a fully grown, and kind of heavyset, adult. I think it was because I had my jeans on since I just got picked up from Sunday school. I think they should tell you ahead of time that if you're a heavier boy and weigh 250 or more then jeans on the slide might slow you down and make everyone think you got stuck.

We enjoy going to this place to escape the heat. However, every single time....and I do mean every single time I end up sick after we go there.

The dust can be seen from the tops of the playground. The rubber mats are disgusting black.

A little boy got hurt from where the game fell over on him.

I will be trying to find other activities for the remainder of 5 weeks of summer.

Im depending on you guys to clean up. I dont plan on coming back anytime soon. When I do, Im bringing a germ bacteria detector.

Get them girls who sit at the front desk texting/on their phone to start cleaning. When I come back, I want to see them wiping and scrubbing everything non-stop.

Review: Kind of disappointed with them this time . We came a few years ago and liked it . Came back this morning at opening , I was by myself with my two kids . Which both are autistic , and then 20 minutes later they accepted bus loads of students . I get it’s a public place , but I really wish I would’ve been informed that they had like a field trip or whatever coming . I would have just came back later . I paid full price and only got half an hour with my kiddos inside . I can’t keep track of two children by myself with a small room full of probably 100 some kids . I had to apologize to my kids for wasting their time , and I’m pretty upset I wasted my money . Personally I think they should’ve let me know , or just book a few hours specifically for the field trip and not accept other guests . A lot of these kids were playing in the zone meant for much smaller kids . I had kids 3 times the size of my 2 and 4 year old trampling over them to go down toddler slides . Very disappointing .

Review: I liked this place but haven’t been back in a couple months, what a disappointment tonight! lots of broken pieces, they have one staff member for the whole place, no one enforces keeping the older kids out of the baby area, parents that reek of weed and not paying attention to their kids at all, would not recommend for anyone who’s not at least 5yo.

Review: we took our 11mo old here for the first time yesterday. it was a great experience, relatively clean for a kid’s play place, but i just have one critique. i wish the staff were more receptive of the age-designated areas and enforced it better. we had a 7/8 year old girl come into the under 2 year old area multiple times and almost hit our son with the balls from the ball pit because she was throwing them everywhere. the mother was clearly under the influence of something so i would’ve appreciated some intervention from the staff. besides that, this is a great place to take kiddos!

Review: I brought my grandson to a party at Ready Set Play, I have never been so appalled at the behavior of a business owner. Instead of pulling the party host to the side to say that her time was up, he basically almost threw us out of the room to set up for the next party. The arrogant attitude about his 5 star rating and how many parties he throws a year was mind blowing. So it's all about the money and how many turnovers he has in one day seems to be the goal, not the birthday experience for the child. I pray whoever reads this post creates a business that will close this business. Parents that spend this type of money should not have to endure rude, arrogant and pretentious behavior.

A great place for a kid just to cut loose. I think there should be a barrier between the kitchen and the tables. A gate between the video games and the play area. A gate between the little toddler section and the walkway. Just a suggestion. Great place.

Review: My daughter at ready,set,play. She loved it. And she turns 2 next month. It was her first time. But once they start crawling they can start going. They have a crawler area. Which is more like a baby toddler area. But my daughter still enjoyed it. This would be good for Roxie for a long time. The small playground it's good up to age 12 or something. There was a ball pit. She loved. A balloon box. If I could rate it 4.5 if I could. I loved the place for my daughter. I just hope the vacuum in the back. My daughter found a dead stinkbug and almost ate it. I'd still take her back cause there isn't many indoor playgrounds where we live.

I weigh 235 lbs, and I don't feel any of the play sets sway or wobble under me while I chase around my 2 year old. The staff is courteous and efficient, which is also amazing considering how many people they are catering to. The variety of equipment and games is also great, so your kid(s) won't have trouble finding something they enjoy. There's plenty of seating, and food available too. I highly recommend this place for any occasion. It's also worth mentioning that they have party times available. We had a great time and loved it!

Review: Nice place for a reasonable price. If you are planning a trip, you can sign the release form ahead of time by completing it online via their website. There’s a small cafe where they sell snacks and drinks. Children can run and play at one price for hours. Pictures shown is from the cafe view. There is an area for children under 7 and a separate area for the older children. The weight limit for playing is 250, so many adults can also enjoy playing with the children.

The prices are amazing, you pay and have the entire day open to close to play and have fun. Everything is big and sturdy so parents can join in on the fun too I know I did both times I've been there! Babies 1 year and under are free when accompanying a sibling, ages 1-3 (I believe) are like 10$ and 2 adults per family is allowed for free. So myself, my sister in law, my 11 month old and 2 year old went on a Wednesday for only 10$!! It was amazing. Prices for fri-sun are like 5$ more expensive but still not bad at all. So much to do and everything is very well padded so it's nice and safe. It's just a blast and I wanna live there. Lol

He did enjoy some of the play structures but my 4 stars is mainly for cleanliness and the overall look of the facility. It appeared to be very dirty especially the play mats and some of the structures just look very unclean. There were also a lot of things like the ball guns that just didn’t work at all, or caution tape around things, it just didn’t look very presentable. When my kiddo is older I’d deff prob come back just not on the weekend. Pretty packed and most don’t watch their children leaving them to knock down or throw things at younger kids. We will stick to totsville for now

Review: If you haven’t been in a while, don’t go expecting what it was a few years ago. More than half of the equipment was broken, or gone. There are holes in the climbing, making it unsafe - as kids can climb on top of the structures. Caution taped off areas all over. There was also cleaning supplies left out in the climbing structures. I watch my kid - but for others, that could be detrimental. I wouldn’t recommend this place at ALL.

My second favorite part is there climbing structures are all connected. Don’t waste your time with any other play places and come to this one! Also did I mention they do birthday parties?

Review: I would NOT recommend location birthday parties only for kids to enjoy the playground and have fun but outside of that , our party Experience was an ABSOLUTE Nightmare. Unfortunately, today we were unable to enjoy our party with constantly being followed around by the new host to the point where she climbed up on a playground to deliver the bill mid party. There was no organization or Communication!,  to be honest We would’ve operated better without a host. it was more like being policed & rushed out the room.
And as for the  manager Yaya whom Completely lacks customer service to start with she wasn’t allowing Guest due to the fact that we paid before their arrival, we wasnt not notified  about our guest & took 5minutes for her to understand that we’re willing to pay for the xtra children, and unfortunately, she’s telling my guess it’s a $21 fee perchild yet told me right in front of them that it was a $17 fee.  the way miss yaya sat outside the party room staring through the window at 7:10 pushing for is to leave At 7:15 is when we was suppose to clean up. Remind you where the last party of the day at that point, the only party of there. We basically got treated like we were unwanted and thieves for having a birthday party. I didn’t get the assitant managers name, but she has been nothing but outstanding customer service and understanding should be the main one managing!!
I really wish I would’ve took pictures, but I was trying to enjoy my child party & like i said I would  recommend location birthday parties unless you want completely surcharged for lack of Communication & a headache.

The safety standards are lacking; I noticed several areas that weren’t secured, which made me worry about my kids’ safety. Additionally, the staff was rude and unhelpful, which made the whole visit unpleasant. I expected a family-friendly environment, but Kidzville falls short. I won’t be returning and wouldn’t recommend it to other parents.”

Review: The two armed male security guards haven’t been onsite the past few times I’ve visited. They made my family feel safe, as we saw them handle serious altercations among feuding patrons. Some of Kidzville’s clientele is unsavory, and you need strong, armed men there to deter and address dangerous behavior. Please beef up the security presence again, or my family will not feel safe spending time at Kidzville anymore.

Review: Typical loud, crowded, kid playground except also full of adults yammering away on their cellphones and screaming at their kids. Adults have to wear socks too, so if you’re throwing a party have the forethought to put that on the invite. They got a little too excited about making me buy socks when I was only wearing sandals. Seems a little scammy and overpriced. Lots of better options for a birthday party in the area. Would not recommend.

actively engaged in watching and helping kids.

I didn't come expecting to play but I'm an adult and I had a ball. We can't wait to come back. There's also food. We stayed here for hours. Our favorite bounce place now hands down.

Review: I didn’t come here for a party. It was just a play date, and I really wanted to like this place because the kids had an amazing time. But I can’t overlook the condition of the facility.

Everything about the place feels old, dingy, and unsanitary. Several play structures were literally held together with duct tape. The ball pit had balls with missing foam or foam completely exposed. There’s also a slide that goes straight down into a pole, which doesn’t seem like the safest design.

What really pushed me over the edge was the bathroom. The smell hit me the second I opened the door. It smelled like urine that had been sitting for days. Toilet paper was all over the floor, and not a single surface felt clean enough to touch. I couldn’t even bring myself to walk in. It was just too disgusting. 🤢

If management put some effort into repairs and basic cleaning, this could be a great spot for kids. But until that happens, I won’t be coming back. You’re better off going to Hyper Kidz or Chuck E. Cheese.

The girl at the front desk had the customer service energy of someone at the DMV, not exactly welcoming or helpful.

The equipment? Faded, patched-up, and dirty, and don’t let the bright colors fool you, nothing felt clean, safe, or well-maintained. If this is your first time here, make it your last. Matter of fact.. Save your money.

Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks at a real indoor play center. Your kids deserve better.

Review: We had my niece’s birthday party at Play EC in Capitol Heights. The kids had a great time on the jungle gym and play areas, but the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The party room wasn’t available until 4 p.m. even though the party was scheduled for 2:30, which was frustrating. The space is small and felt overcrowded on a busy Saturday.

It was hot inside, especially in the back where the air doesn’t circulate well. The facility could be cleaner—dust triggered my allergies, and there were items stored under the jungle gym. Staff seemed limited—only three people on site, including the manager.

They did provide pizza, juice, and handled setup, and the decor was nice, though clearly reused. Be careful with helium balloons—if one floats to the ceiling, they’ll charge up to $150 to retrieve it or you can risk your safety and try to get it down yourself, they will provide the ladder for you.

It’s probably best to go during a weekday or rent the full space if you’re planning a party. Great for kids, but not the most comfortable for adults.

Review: SCAMMERS!!!
We booked a birthday party at this establishment for 5:30 PM and paid $600 in advance, as required. However, we arrived at 5:47 PM and were shocked to find that we had to wait nearly two hours for a party room to become available. Despite paying for a private room for two full hours, we were not given access to a room until 7:30 PM. To make matters worse, the manager informed us that we had to vacate by 7:45 PM—after receiving only 15 minutes of use.

The experience was completely unacceptable. The pizza provided was cold, and the drinks were old Capri Sun juice boxes. This is not what we paid for, and certainly not what was advertised.

As a Black woman supporting a Black-owned business, I expected professionalism, respect, and accountability. Unfortunately, this experience confirmed why many hesitate to support our own—because some businesses treat paying customers as if their money and time don’t matter. I feel disrespected, disappointed, and frankly scammed out of $600 for a service that was never properly delivered.

For comparison, Chuck E. Cheese charges $200 less and honors their time slots. Even if you arrive late, they simply deduct that time from your reservation—they don’t force you to wait two hours for a room you already paid for.

This business failed to meet basic expectations and left my family and guests feeling disregarded. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously so that no other family has to go through what we experienced.

Review: I’m giving this place one star solely because my child enjoyed coming here BEFORE we booked a party. However, I can confidently say this is not a 4-star establishment—don’t be misled by Google reviews. Many of the honest 1-star reviews can be found on Yelp.
The management is unprofessional, greedy, and show no appreciation for their guests. My party décor was nothing like what I requested, and both the party host and management were rude and dismissive. After the event, I sent a polite and professional email regarding my deposit, only to receive nothing but disrespect and unprofessional back-and-forth responses, as if I were arguing with a child.
They claim they’ve made “upgrades”—absolutely not. The facility still smells like feet, the foam pit cubes are falling apart and unsanitary, and to top it off, the entire place reeked of weed as we were leaving. They don’t have enough staff to monitor guests, so anyone can come and go freely, creating a safety concern.
Despite advertising that the space is for kids 8 years and younger, there were older, rough-playing kids who posed a risk to younger children. They also claim to provide waivers and wristbands for safety, but that wasn’t enforced at all.
To make matters worse, the candy wall décor contained old, stale, and hard candy—and this was during my party!
If you're considering booking a party here, think twice. They make up their own rules, have no regard for customer satisfaction, and will take your money without delivering the promised experience. I truly regret spending my hard-earned money here and not receiving my deposit back. Beware before booking! I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: It was so crowded and so many children over the age of 8 on the equipment around toddlers I saw one baby bust his lip because he got pushed by the whale swings and landed right in front of the slides while someone was coming down 😢, I came to celebrate my baby’s 2 birthday frozen theme they didn’t use my balloons just the previous party balloons for the garland, It was unorganized, late for party reservations and then rush you out the room, play area unsanitary and old, not worth the money $580 I’m going to see if I get my $150 deposit back like they said and then I’ll be back to inform you guys on that…I gave a 2 star because I loved the room setting in the party room and because I came here before on a week night and nobody was here so it was a beautiful and amazing experience for my 2 year old I live close by and I’ll still take her to get her sleepy for bed but i highly doubt I will do another party

Update: I received my $150 deposit and they called to get a better of my issues so that it won’t happen again in the future… and again it’s a nice place on the weekday for children under 8 years old thank you

Review: I’ve had a party here my son comes all the time but today. The lady insisted on charging for an additional adult but the the website says 2 free adults with a child. It’s not like we are playing literally watching the kid play. Really should get consistent policies and not just make stuff up.

Review: ***PLEASE BE AWARE, DO NOT BOOK A PARTY HERE!!! I booked the birthday package for my daughter's 3rd birthday and it was a disaster from the moment we walked in. The facility was overcrowded, and my 3 year old couldn't even play on the equipment. You don't get access to the room until it's time to eat in which they didn't mention. I had countless emails and phone calls with the party director. They tried to get me to pay for extra adults beforehand, saying it was going to be at capacity that day. Glad I didn't, because it was already at capacity. The party host was lazy and couldnt answer any of our concerns. The pizza we received was cold and looked like they dropped it on the floor. There was no manager in sight and no one answered any of my calls or texts until weeks later and even then the best they could offer was passes to come back! I would never patronize this place! Do not waste your time or money! Do not waste your time or money! We could've went to Chuckie Cheese instead of wasting of time and energy! Oh and i'm still waiting on my deposit back and my event was over 3 weeks ago. I wouldn't allow my child to go back if it was free. The owners ought to be ashamed of themselves

Review: The worse place I've been to for a kid's party. No organization, over crowded, and rides were taped up with duck tape. This in NOT a safe place for toddlers. You have bigger kids playing and swinging on the rides that shouldn't even be on them. This place is beyond dangerous and I most certainly will not be returning. My nephew had to be rushed to the hospital for stitches after being busted in the head as he was walking pass ride. He was hit in the head by a metal piece that was covered in duct tape. Upon us calling the ambulance, we asked the worker for the address and she had to find it on paperwork. They weren't concerned nor sympathetic for his injury. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!

Review: Please do not have your parties here,I arrived for my son party, the place was 85 degrees inside,I ask them was the air on, they said the air was on but everyone was walking around complaining,not sure how many others did a complaint, you pay for a 2 hour party room, that you only have access to for 40 minutes, it was icing from cake on one of the chairs from the party before mines, why because they don’t wipe down anything they  just throw the table cloth away,they rush you out of the party room, one of the ladies came throwing away things off the table as the party was going,saying they have another party.if you have elderly people that’s attending your party they will have to sit at the entrance instead of the party room,they don’t sanitize at all, play equipment was dirty, they press you out about socks,when the socks are $3 which should come with all party packages.Bathrooms stinks and dirty. DONT HAVE YOUR PARTIES HERE,you will regret it,it’s not worth it,GO TO CHUCKECHEESE atleast you will see someone wiping tables and games down,and they do not rush you out, this business are ran by people who loves the heat…!!! But it’s not comfortable and not fair to people that’s paying for the services !!!!

Review: Unfortunately this place has gone way down hill. Due to poor management of rules, the equipment is falling apart. Anyplace that has EC in the title needs to stick to that. EC means early childhood and that is 8 and under. Huge children that were bigger than me on the equipment. I watched something break. Then parents are belligerent trying to provoke fights. Yelling and cursing at you if you go to management simply to tell them their equipment broke because they didn’t see. Not coming back.

Review: Overall, I like the concept of this play place. There is supposed to be an age cap for the range of children allowed to use the space and get on the activity play set-ups. My grandson is two and highly enjoys going to this place.  It's Maryland's best kept secret. The only con is that when they have birthday parties, there are sometimes older children who attend. They're too big for the play area and it's already a small space. In my opinion, it takes away from the younger children being able to fully immerse themselves in the space. When they do birthday parties, maybe they should consider charging for a few hours to rent out the entire space just for the party and close it off to the public until the party is over. The last time I was there with my grandson , it was a mixture of party goers and outside kids and it was a mess. The other children who are not a part of the party are left out and see the party favors and set up and are limited to their play time but the party kids have access to it all. This causes confusion. Other than that , it's a great place to take younger kids maybe 2-6 to play.

Review: My wife took the kids there to play because it was raining and couldn't go to six flags instead. Initially my oldest had to use a bathroom but wasn't planning on playing there but since our middle child started to run around and jump around a bit the front desk came up and demanded that we pay for our kids. We thought ok that's fine since our middle started to play but they demand that we pay full price for our youngest too... My youngest is only 10 months old. So service from this place is trash.
Next from the pictures it seems big but don't let it fool you, I guess because it was raining the place was packed, to the point where the kids could barely move around. We felt as if they had definitely over packed this place and didn't follow the max occupancy just to an extra buck.
Lastly the place is nasty, I don't know when was the last time they cleaned this place or even if it's been clean at all. Not to mention the smell of some illicit substance. I don't know if they have someone using that in the bad or what but we can definitely smell it. So overall this place is not worth the $15 per child. Customer service sucks, over crowded, and the place is filthy and smells. So I would pick another place to take your kids.
Last thing I want to mention I don't know if there was a change of ownership but if you look at most of the recent reviews they are all 1 star vs the review from 2 years ago. Food for thought.

Review: Paying $400 for a party here is honestly not worth it at ALL. you get 2 hours but only allowed in the room for 40 mins. so basically youre paying $400 for 40 mins in a room, a backdrop of the theme, 3 pizzas , some juice, paper plates and napkins. you can spend the same amount throwing your own party at home with MORE stuff literally.My main problem was I booked & paid for a specific room & they did not give me the room i paid for. Instead gave it to another party & gave me a completely different room. Some of the equipment needs maintenance or to be fixed. They have nets that are completely RIPPED OPEN, where a child can literally fall through it & hurt themselves.

Review: Went to a Birthday party there yesterday, Everything was like a 50/50 good/bad experience .
They had him in a little corner behind the trampoline with little to no light. The setup was adorable with the little cute chairs they had. The pizza was delicious but the environment could use better sanitation they could improve this by just having ppl purchase their socks instead. They should also start looking at replacing some of their stuff in there as they are getting worn out.

Despite the mess I've seen my kids enjoyed themselves and I had to drag my youngest out lol

It's limited space so mentally prepare yourself parents cause at some point it will annoy you. I can see in better weather I would just leave my stuff in the car.  There are seats for adults nearby to watch your kids as you should.

The workers don’t let you into your room until a hour later after your scheduled time. They interrupt your room to take down decorations more than 20 minutes before the time is up. Snatched table clothes off the table while babies are eating.  Very unprofessional. Don’t bring your kids here you will highly regret!

Review: I attended a party for my niece today and I was completely dissatisfied with the customer service. Not only was the party booked and paid for from 2-4 , we could not access the party room until 3. We had to quickly set up and around 3:30 the workers started taking the table cloths, and backdrop while we were still celebrating. This day was supposed to be about celebrating my niece but we were quickly rushed out. The workers were rude, and unorganized and I truly didn’t appreciate them cutting the party short. I will no longer attend here, and it’s disheartening to see a business run like this.

Review: Upon arrival, we were directed into the paly area for our 1 of paly time. In your disclosure your company states that you “provide a safe and stimulating environment for kids 8 and under to explore because we truly believe that growing up should be a memorable experience for every child.”. However, this was NOT the case on Sunday, there were multiple kids above the maximum age and weight limit who were filliping, spinning diving and jumping of the equipment and bumping into my one and two year old babies. The children were unsupervised and there was no staff to regulate play. I had to step in and stop rough play to keep my party’s babies safe. The condition and cleanliness of the equipment and play area was also unsanitary, unsafe, and broken. There was an event of a child vomiting (which is normal due to running around) however the facility did not have the proper cleaning supplies to aid the mess. There weren’t any trash bags, no disinfectant, no clothes, no mop nothing that could sanitize the area to continue play. My family and I had to help clean the entire surface area because of the short staffing. Even after surface cleaning, we had to continue to encourage shutting down that specific area due to lack of disinfectant treatment to that area. When directed back to our party room there was a walkway full of cake, water and just spilled the entire walkway, all my guest and children walker in socks and were subject to stepping in the filth on the ground. The “Swiffer used to clean the walkway after it was brought to staffing attention was not efficient as it did not have the proper size cleaning pad.  The rest rooms were unsanitary and had food and trash everywhere. The facility was not cleaned regularly during playtime.

During the celebration in the party room, we were not provided“ trained party host to ensure a stress-free experience” as stated in the companies. There were not enough napkins, plates, no utensils for the guest. All of which had to be retrieved upon consistent requests. The chairs and tables were filthy, torn and not in presentable condition. I cannot stress enough the lack of staffing we experienced at this facility. I was under the impression that there would be a capacity limit at which I know were not carefully monitored because the individuals in my party as well as incoming guest were not accounted for. The “memorable, safe, clean and courteous” environment promised for the amount myself and husband had to pay for our daughter wasn’t not delivered at this facility. My daughters first birthday experience as well as our guest was ultimately ruined.

NEVER AGAIN, OVERPRICED UNPROFESSIONAL AND BEYONG FILTHY.

Review: Staff was pleasant. Location was small. Pretty dirty everywhere I looked (I went through all the attractions b4 my kid to inspect) all the extra toys were old and grimy.
Kids had an ok time but they got bored really quick. This place is pretty much for babies and toddlers so don’t take any child over 3

Since My original review this place has STEPPED THEIR GAME UP! I’ll be honest, I only re-visited because it’s cheap and was still somewhat entertaining for my 1 & 4 yr olds.
But I was pleasantly surprised when we did🫶🏾
Way more attractions and much cleaner than before. They had newer toys and better snacks even. I’m happy to continue supporting this business because they seem like they are taking the upkeep of their facilities more seriously now. Thank you 🙏🏾

I only gave 4 stars because there is a support beam in the middle of the room that they positioned a tall slide right in front of😬😅
The slide itself is a 3 seater so the beam only blocks one. I just make sure my children don’t use that slide because it’s dangerous.
The inertia built up (even by a kid) coming down that thing could legit snap a neck😳

Other than that though perfect for a night of “letting them tire themselves out”

The bathroom for the general crowd hadn't been cleaned and smelled horrible. The bathroom that was in the party room (which the young lady at the front desk escorted us only. I thought she was the hostess as well, but i guess you dont get one) was full of tissue and feces. So we had no bathroom to use. It wasn't safe as well because one of the slides had a pole at the end of the slide, so you would slide right into it. Unsafe and poorly maintained.

Review: I didn’t come here for a party. It was just a play date, and I really wanted to like this place because the kids had an amazing time. But I can’t overlook the condition of the facility.

Everything about the place feels old, dingy, and unsanitary. Several play structures were literally held together with duct tape. The ball pit had balls with missing foam or foam completely exposed. There’s also a slide that goes straight down into a pole, which doesn’t seem like the safest design.

What really pushed me over the edge was the bathroom. The smell hit me the second I opened the door. It smelled like urine that had been sitting for days. Toilet paper was all over the floor, and not a single surface felt clean enough to touch. I couldn’t even bring myself to walk in. It was just too disgusting. 🤢

If management put some effort into repairs and basic cleaning, this could be a great spot for kids. But until that happens, I won’t be coming back. You’re better off going to Hyper Kidz or Chuck E. Cheese.

Everything is held together by duck tape and the rides are not even on… DO NOT take your kids to this place.. adults are not allowed on equipment likely bc it’s held together by tape and not safe! Take the drive and go to hyper kidz. This place looks like a section 8 hyper kidz.. disgusting

Review: This place is basically the Dollar Tree version of Hyper Kidz. The entire setup looks like it’s being held together with Scotch tape. Everything felt dingy, worn down, and just tired.

The girl at the front desk had the customer service energy of someone at the DMV, not exactly welcoming or helpful.

The equipment? Faded, patched-up, and dirty, and don’t let the bright colors fool you, nothing felt clean, safe, or well-maintained. If this is your first time here, make it your last. Matter of fact.. Save your money.

Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks at a real indoor play center. Your kids deserve better.

Review: Went here for my nieces birthday party and it was ridiculously hot and humid. I’ve been here previously in the winter and it was hot and miserable but this event in May was unbearable. The management and staff were ratchet and not pleasant to work with at all. I will never attend an event here, let alone book here.

Review: We had my niece’s birthday party at Play EC in Capitol Heights. The kids had a great time on the jungle gym and play areas, but the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The party room wasn’t available until 4 p.m. even though the party was scheduled for 2:30, which was frustrating. The space is small and felt overcrowded on a busy Saturday.

It was hot inside, especially in the back where the air doesn’t circulate well. The facility could be cleaner—dust triggered my allergies, and there were items stored under the jungle gym. Staff seemed limited—only three people on site, including the manager.

They did provide pizza, juice, and handled setup, and the decor was nice, though clearly reused. Be careful with helium balloons—if one floats to the ceiling, they’ll charge up to $150 to retrieve it or you can risk your safety and try to get it down yourself, they will provide the ladder for you.

It’s probably best to go during a weekday or rent the full space if you’re planning a party. Great for kids, but not the most comfortable for adults.

Now, the two young ladies working had excellent customer service and tried to make us comfortable. I really appreciate their help.
Btw....the party room was well decorated.

Review: SCAMMERS!!!
We booked a birthday party at this establishment for 5:30 PM and paid $600 in advance, as required. However, we arrived at 5:47 PM and were shocked to find that we had to wait nearly two hours for a party room to become available. Despite paying for a private room for two full hours, we were not given access to a room until 7:30 PM. To make matters worse, the manager informed us that we had to vacate by 7:45 PM—after receiving only 15 minutes of use.

The experience was completely unacceptable. The pizza provided was cold, and the drinks were old Capri Sun juice boxes. This is not what we paid for, and certainly not what was advertised.

As a Black woman supporting a Black-owned business, I expected professionalism, respect, and accountability. Unfortunately, this experience confirmed why many hesitate to support our own—because some businesses treat paying customers as if their money and time don’t matter. I feel disrespected, disappointed, and frankly scammed out of $600 for a service that was never properly delivered.

For comparison, Chuck E. Cheese charges $200 less and honors their time slots. Even if you arrive late, they simply deduct that time from your reservation—they don’t force you to wait two hours for a room you already paid for.

This business failed to meet basic expectations and left my family and guests feeling disregarded. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously so that no other family has to go through what we experienced.

Review: This place was a travesty! There were mounds of trash at the back door, clearly visible to customers. The floors were filthy, and kids in the play area were spilling drinks and food everywhere. Big kids were running over the little ones, and I almost had to intervene in a fight between two boys who looked to be around 13. I didn’t see any staff on the floor enforcing the rules. It truly has potential, but it falls short in many important areas.

Review: I’m giving this place one star solely because my child enjoyed coming here BEFORE we booked a party. However, I can confidently say this is not a 4-star establishment—don’t be misled by Google reviews. Many of the honest 1-star reviews can be found on Yelp.
The management is unprofessional, greedy, and show no appreciation for their guests. My party décor was nothing like what I requested, and both the party host and management were rude and dismissive. After the event, I sent a polite and professional email regarding my deposit, only to receive nothing but disrespect and unprofessional back-and-forth responses, as if I were arguing with a child.
They claim they’ve made “upgrades”—absolutely not. The facility still smells like feet, the foam pit cubes are falling apart and unsanitary, and to top it off, the entire place reeked of weed as we were leaving. They don’t have enough staff to monitor guests, so anyone can come and go freely, creating a safety concern.
Despite advertising that the space is for kids 8 years and younger, there were older, rough-playing kids who posed a risk to younger children. They also claim to provide waivers and wristbands for safety, but that wasn’t enforced at all.
To make matters worse, the candy wall décor contained old, stale, and hard candy—and this was during my party!
If you're considering booking a party here, think twice. They make up their own rules, have no regard for customer satisfaction, and will take your money without delivering the promised experience. I truly regret spending my hard-earned money here and not receiving my deposit back. Beware before booking! I would never recommend this place to anyone.

Review: It was so crowded and so many children over the age of 8 on the equipment around toddlers I saw one baby bust his lip because he got pushed by the whale swings and landed right in front of the slides while someone was coming down 😢, I came to celebrate my baby’s 2 birthday frozen theme they didn’t use my balloons just the previous party balloons for the garland, It was unorganized, late for party reservations and then rush you out the room, play area unsanitary and old, not worth the money $580 I’m going to see if I get my $150 deposit back like they said and then I’ll be back to inform you guys on that…I gave a 2 star because I loved the room setting in the party room and because I came here before on a week night and nobody was here so it was a beautiful and amazing experience for my 2 year old I live close by and I’ll still take her to get her sleepy for bed but i highly doubt I will do another party

Update: I received my $150 deposit and they called to get a better of my issues so that it won’t happen again in the future… and again it’s a nice place on the weekday for children under 8 years old thank you

The facility was overcrowded, and my 3 year old couldn't even play on the equipment. You don't get access to the room until it's time to eat in which they didn't mention. I had countless emails and phone calls with the party director. They tried to get me to pay for extra adults beforehand, saying it was going to be at capacity that day. Glad I didn't, because it was already at capacity. The party host was lazy and couldnt answer any of our concerns. The pizza we received was cold and looked like they dropped it on the floor. There was no manager in sight and no one answered any of my calls or texts until weeks later and even then the best they could offer was passes to come back! I would never patronize this place! Do not waste your time or money! Do not waste your time or money! We could've went to Chuckie Cheese instead of wasting of time and energy! Oh and i'm still waiting on my deposit back and my event was over 3 weeks ago. I wouldn't allow my child to go back if it was free. The owners ought to be ashamed of themselves

Review: The worse place I've been to for a kid's party. No organization, over crowded, and rides were taped up with duck tape. This in NOT a safe place for toddlers. You have bigger kids playing and swinging on the rides that shouldn't even be on them. This place is beyond dangerous and I most certainly will not be returning. My nephew had to be rushed to the hospital for stitches after being busted in the head as he was walking pass ride. He was hit in the head by a metal piece that was covered in duct tape. Upon us calling the ambulance, we asked the worker for the address and she had to find it on paperwork. They weren't concerned nor sympathetic for his injury. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE!

Review: Unfortunately this place has gone way down hill. Due to poor management of rules, the equipment is falling apart. Anyplace that has EC in the title needs to stick to that. EC means early childhood and that is 8 and under. Huge children that were bigger than me on the equipment. I watched something break. Then parents are belligerent trying to provoke fights. Yelling and cursing at you if you go to management simply to tell them their equipment broke because they didn’t see. Not coming back.

Review: Overall, I like the concept of this play place. There is supposed to be an age cap for the range of children allowed to use the space and get on the activity play set-ups. My grandson is two and highly enjoys going to this place.  It's Maryland's best kept secret. The only con is that when they have birthday parties, there are sometimes older children who attend. They're too big for the play area and it's already a small space. In my opinion, it takes away from the younger children being able to fully immerse themselves in the space. When they do birthday parties, maybe they should consider charging for a few hours to rent out the entire space just for the party and close it off to the public until the party is over. The last time I was there with my grandson , it was a mixture of party goers and outside kids and it was a mess. The other children who are not a part of the party are left out and see the party favors and set up and are limited to their play time but the party kids have access to it all. This causes confusion. Other than that , it's a great place to take younger kids maybe 2-6 to play.

Review: My wife took the kids there to play because it was raining and couldn't go to six flags instead. Initially my oldest had to use a bathroom but wasn't planning on playing there but since our middle child started to run around and jump around a bit the front desk came up and demanded that we pay for our kids. We thought ok that's fine since our middle started to play but they demand that we pay full price for our youngest too... My youngest is only 10 months old. So service from this place is trash.
Next from the pictures it seems big but don't let it fool you, I guess because it was raining the place was packed, to the point where the kids could barely move around. We felt as if they had definitely over packed this place and didn't follow the max occupancy just to an extra buck.
Lastly the place is nasty, I don't know when was the last time they cleaned this place or even if it's been clean at all. Not to mention the smell of some illicit substance. I don't know if they have someone using that in the bad or what but we can definitely smell it. So overall this place is not worth the $15 per child. Customer service sucks, over crowded, and the place is filthy and smells. So I would pick another place to take your kids.
Last thing I want to mention I don't know if there was a change of ownership but if you look at most of the recent reviews they are all 1 star vs the review from 2 years ago. Food for thought.

Instead gave it to another party & gave me a completely different room. Some of the equipment needs maintenance or to be fixed. They have nets that are completely RIPPED OPEN, where a child can literally fall through it & hurt themselves.

Review: Went to a Birthday party there yesterday, Everything was like a 50/50 good/bad experience .
They had him in a little corner behind the trampoline with little to no light. The setup was adorable with the little cute chairs they had. The pizza was delicious but the environment could use better sanitation they could improve this by just having ppl purchase their socks instead. They should also start looking at replacing some of their stuff in there as they are getting worn out.

Despite the mess I've seen my kids enjoyed themselves and I had to drag my youngest out lol

It's limited space so mentally prepare yourself parents cause at some point it will annoy you. I can see in better weather I would just leave my stuff in the car.  There are seats for adults nearby to watch your kids as you should.

Not only was the party booked and paid for from 2-4 , we could not access the party room until 3. We had to quickly set up and around 3:30 the workers started taking the table cloths, and backdrop while we were still celebrating. This day was supposed to be about celebrating my niece but we were quickly rushed out. The workers were rude, and unorganized and I truly didn’t appreciate them cutting the party short. I will no longer attend here, and it’s disheartening to see a business run like this.

However, this was NOT the case on Sunday, there were multiple kids above the maximum age and weight limit who were filliping, spinning diving and jumping of the equipment and bumping into my one and two year old babies. The children were unsupervised and there was no staff to regulate play. I had to step in and stop rough play to keep my party’s babies safe. The condition and cleanliness of the equipment and play area was also unsanitary, unsafe, and broken. There was an event of a child vomiting (which is normal due to running around) however the facility did not have the proper cleaning supplies to aid the mess. There weren’t any trash bags, no disinfectant, no clothes, no mop nothing that could sanitize the area to continue play. My family and I had to help clean the entire surface area because of the short staffing. Even after surface cleaning, we had to continue to encourage shutting down that specific area due to lack of disinfectant treatment to that area. When directed back to our party room there was a walkway full of cake, water and just spilled the entire walkway, all my guest and children walker in socks and were subject to stepping in the filth on the ground. The “Swiffer used to clean the walkway after it was brought to staffing attention was not efficient as it did not have the proper size cleaning pad.  The rest rooms were unsanitary and had food and trash everywhere. The facility was not cleaned regularly during playtime.

During the celebration in the party room, we were not provided“ trained party host to ensure a stress-free experience” as stated in the companies. There were not enough napkins, plates, no utensils for the guest. All of which had to be retrieved upon consistent requests. The chairs and tables were filthy, torn and not in presentable condition. I cannot stress enough the lack of staffing we experienced at this facility. I was under the impression that there would be a capacity limit at which I know were not carefully monitored because the individuals in my party as well as incoming guest were not accounted for. The “memorable, safe, clean and courteous” environment promised for the amount myself and husband had to pay for our daughter wasn’t not delivered at this facility. My daughters first birthday experience as well as our guest was ultimately ruined.

NEVER AGAIN, OVERPRICED UNPROFESSIONAL AND BEYONG FILTHY.

Review: Staff was pleasant. Location was small. Pretty dirty everywhere I looked (I went through all the attractions b4 my kid to inspect) all the extra toys were old and grimy.
Kids had an ok time but they got bored really quick. This place is pretty much for babies and toddlers so don’t take any child over 3

Since My original review this place has STEPPED THEIR GAME UP! I’ll be honest, I only re-visited because it’s cheap and was still somewhat entertaining for my 1 & 4 yr olds.
But I was pleasantly surprised when we did🫶🏾
Way more attractions and much cleaner than before. They had newer toys and better snacks even. I’m happy to continue supporting this business because they seem like they are taking the upkeep of their facilities more seriously now. Thank you 🙏🏾

I only gave 4 stars because there is a support beam in the middle of the room that they positioned a tall slide right in front of😬😅
The slide itself is a 3 seater so the beam only blocks one. I just make sure my children don’t use that slide because it’s dangerous.
The inertia built up (even by a kid) coming down that thing could legit snap a neck😳

Other than that though perfect for a night of “letting them tire themselves out”
👌🏾

Review: I had my granddaughters 1st birthday at this facility and it was poorly kept. The toys had dirt marks on them, were they were poorly maintained and hadn't been cleaned in awhile. The bathroom for the general crowd hadn't been cleaned and smelled horrible. The bathroom that was in the party room (which the young lady at the front desk escorted us only. I thought she was the hostess as well, but i guess you dont get one) was full of tissue and feces. So we had no bathroom to use. It wasn't safe as well because one of the slides had a pole at the end of the slide, so you would slide right into it. Unsafe and poorly maintained.

Review: Our family had an absolute blast at Joyland kidz! My 3 yr old son and 16-month-old daughter enjoyed every moment. From the moment you walk in, Joyland gives off a fun, energetic vibe that sets the tone for an unforgettable experience. The entire space is clean, safe, and well organized. The kids were entertained the whole time from the exciting slides and bouncing rooms to the interactive play areas. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made sure everyone felt welcomed. Customer service was top-notch, and it’s clear the team truly cares about creating a positive environment for families. I highly recommend Joyland kidz for a fun-filled day the whole family will love! We will definitely come back!

Review: I visited Joyland on 7-1 with my 3 children ages 1, 5, and 8.

Pros:
1. Great location
2. Lots of parking
3. Very clean facility and bathrooms

Cons

1. Young girl working was on her phone as she completed my transaction and answered my questions. It’s nothing more rude than when young people have their AirPods in and are holding two conversations at once. There were times when she was looking at me but talking on her phone.
2. It was 78 degrees inside on a  95 degree day. Their air was set to 64 degrees. I don’t know if it was ventilation issues or AC issues but it was hot. You are not allowed to bring food or drinks inside. They have water fountains but they are near the bathroom (I don’t drink water fountains near bathrooms iykyk) They have a water bottle refill station but you can’t bring bottles in so it doesn’t really make sense.
3. Their price per child no matter what their age, is $15.99 for 2 hours. One adult does enter free with children. There is no different price for younger ages which was shocking to me. HyperKidz and Scramble even have a different price for toddlers vs older children. They also don’t have different weekday prices vs weekend prices.  Paying $16 for a space where my one year old could not even use half of the equipment was unsettling.
4. The space is small. It is the size of the surrounding businesses. I was so happy to have a place close to home but for $16 per child I will take my kids where it is half the price and they actually have more things to do.
5. They require non slip socks. Every indoor playground I have been to requires socks but not non slip socks. The non slip socks are a money grab. They look similar to the sky zone socks but nothing in there is slippery so I really didn’t understand the non slip socks. As I looked around almost every family had them which confirmed for me it was a money grab. Their website also didn’t have the socks under their admissions tab.

I will not be coming back. I really wanted to support a new black owned business but it seems like a money grab for the size and what they have to offer.

Only thing I’m not a fan of here is the pet hospital, it’s a bit closed off so it easily becomes the hangout for kids which I frequently walked over to put eyes on my kid. It would be great if they put a window there

Great place, we trade of between here and kids jungle land in white Marsh. Because the entire ceiling and walls of KidzVille is black and I find it dark and claustrophobic, and there is no where for normal adults to sit comfortably, I  personally prefer kids jungle land which is much more spacious and bright  and has better running and climbing opportunities. They both have great things to do .

Review: Kidzville with the boys last night in Perry Hall!  I was pleasantly surprised how cool the place is and they didn’t try to upcharge everything.  There weren’t any arcade games which I loved.  No tickets to win and cash in for some unnecessary junk. I think admission was 13.99 and you need slipper socks.  They were $2.95 so very reasonable.  It was a big indoor playground with lots of stuff for the kids to do. Perfrct for a rainy night.

The only food they sold was cheese or pepperoni pizza.  You had to buy a whole pizza.  $18 for a 16 inch cheese which was reasonable.  The pizza was also really good.

In addition to the pizzas they had a freezer of ice creams.  They also had water, juice, sodas and coffee pods.  Waters were $2 and juice was $2.50.  Thats all they had which was perfect.  They didn’t even sell candy. Prices were very reasonable!

The boys were exhausted when we left there.

I will definitely go back.

Up front at the registers, there's an ice cream freezer & small refrigerator with bottled water and juice boxes for purchase. Pizzas are also ordered at the register and sold by the pie.

No-slip shoes are available to put on for the bathroom (so that you don't walk in there with just your socks). There's a very long wall of cubbies heading into the play area, in order to put your shoes & belongings up.

Review: For kids, they've got tons of fun things to play on and with. For parents, they have free wifi and lots of places to sit. The place was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.

Note: When going for the first time, keep in mind that there is also a place called ""Kids Zone"" in the same building with a big colorful sign, which is apparently a daycare center not connected with KidzVille, so make sure you go to the correct door.

Review: We took the kids to play in kidzville perry hall to play My daughter wasn't wearing one foot for the socks because her feet was twisted and had to put brackets we didn't go out for a long day and she barely started walking After a while about 30-40 min playing with one socks on and the injuries one wasn't A mom having a kid came to me and telling me that this is disinfectant for others and i am asking you either to let your daughter put it on or leave. I explained nicely about her and she said I don't care. so i replied please watch your kid and mind your business, the kids have been playing and the staff saw her and no one told us anything i told here the kids is sneezing coughing and most of them are sick with no mask and were eating and then play without even washing hands. Here is the problem she didn't like that we are muslims and because one of the staff was the same race and from the same country and they talked their language, the staff member came to me and asked me to leave in a very rude way. I was shocked about her attitude and being in her side because of the same race and country and i asked her for a manager or customer service number she said oh here is the number do what you want. I paid 97 $ for 4 kids for 45 min I tried reaching the corporate number but i didn't get it Please share as much as you can and try to let whoever is the manager or the owner is to know

Review: My kids had a blast. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the music was too loud and noisy and ended up giving me a headache. We left sooner than we had planned because of that. We've been to similar places in the past that had softer/quieter music or no music at all and the kids still had an amazing time. If you want to improve parent's experience, please consider lowering the music. Also, better food/coffee options would be great.

Review: This place is amazing. So many things to do. My problem is. To many older kids running to fast in there. I brought my grandson in today. He was excited about everything. Until he wasn't. Not the fault of the other kid  accidents happen. They have this wrecking ball you can swing on. We were getting ready to go in the ball pit they have. The opening to the ball pit is way to close to where the kids can swing. So my 19 month old grandson got hit in the head, by this kid swinging. Plus the kid didn't even say sorry. Parents r supposed to be watching their kids. Like I said it was an accident. But not teaching the kids to say sorry, and not watching your kid as well. But we won't be back for a while unless theyu have age group for kids set up. The owner gave me an ice pack that wasn't even cold. I shared with her what happen and she just kinda said ""O"". Just thought it could be handled better. But again cool place. Just not for the young ones. If you want to run go to the rec centers or to the parks.

I also like how some areas encourage independent play for the littles while others are setup for parents to join in on the fun and really play with the kids! The whole space is clean, well kept, and feels open even though each play area feels like it is it's own space. So well managed! My 5 and 3 year old love it here and ask to go to open play weekly, lol!

Review: Always an absolute blast! This play place is mostly geared toward the younger set. Probably under age 10 but it depends on how much your kid enjoys imaginary play. My four and six year olds absolutely adore it. The play areas change around periodically but there’s usually a vet center, play kitchen/grocery store, a magic spell booth, puppet show, and a few small games (skee ball, fooseball, basketball) in the back plus a foam pit, small ball pit, trampoline, and a variety of ninja foam blocks to jump and a roller slide and mountain to climb. Also the front area has one of those interactive coloring areas that animates your drawing on a big projector screen. Plus some tables full of building toys. There are plenty of places to sit and chat with other parents while staying within range of your kids. I’m always impressed with how clean they’re able to keep it and how chill the vibe usually is. At our last visit they added a new room full of airtoobz machines which kept my four year old busy for most of the play session. They also added a “snowball fight” area where you could pelt each other with tiny fluffy balls. I ended up in there with both my kids and nephew having the best time. It’s a really great place to go let your kids have a fun without being overstimulated and blasted in the face with screens and lights and ending the day in a meltdown. It gives wholesome playdate vibes and I just adore it. It’s really what the children’s museum in Portsmouth wishes it could be. If you’re a family with a quiet calm child it’s amazing. If you’re a family with a wild animal child climbing the walls and trying to parkour off every surface in your home it’s amazing. Bring em both. They’re gonna love it.

Review: What a great place for kids to stay fully engaged for the two hour open play. They had foosball, skeeball, basketball and ice hockey in the back, great for those a little older. The variety of physical play (foam pit, ninja jumping), imaginary play (pet shop, wizardry, pirates), and interactive floor and wall space was great. We found it very clean too.

Review: 10/10 recommend! Great play place for all ages, including adults. Great customer service & the kids always have fun (they love the gifts they get when leaving). The Open Play sessions are held at convenient times. The birthday party set up and experience is seamless and we will be having our twins next birthday here & can’t wait for all their friends to try it out. The Ninja Warrior class is for ages 6-10, which our kids can’t attend yet but look forward to signing them up for it. The private rentals are great for daycares, summer camps & school with a reasonable price. The one year anniversary party is coming up next week & my kids are excited to try out the new inflatable balloon bubble house. There is even a black Friday sale of punch cards giving 50% off open play admission, which we will be taking advantage of. Overall, this is a great place to take kids of all ages to have fun & run out some energy. Give it a try, you won’t regret it! :)

This place came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others. The activities are versatile and suit all ages. The adults even have fun. The reason I have rated The Play Spot 5 stars is because it is unique, CLEAN, and they always have something new to play with.  If you're looking to have fun with the whole family, this is the spot!

The policy that has parents stay was strange to begin with, but I think the parents had more fun than the kids. Amber, our host, was so helpful and made all the families feel very welcomed. The birthday set up was great as we were the only ones there. We did not have to worry about other guests infringing on our fun. We highly recommend The Play Spot for parties and for even a play spot!

We brought our own food and decorations. Highly recommend for ages 12 and under. Even my teenagers that were there had fun playing. Lots of make believe, games, and things to climb on. This place could accommodate around 15 kids for the party and it was way better than previous parties at large play places because it was more than just a play ground (in my opinion).

I got there and they were closed more than 30 minutes early. It took so long to leave, but I was fine with them playing even for 20 minutes due to how young they are (12months). Disappointed, yet again.

Review: Make your reservations online. I got there in time for there 11:30 slot. I filled out the wavier for my son and I. In order to make a reservation. I had to make a whole account and being I'm not from here. I didn't see a point. I was 15 minutes away and they had 4 slots available for 11:30 and noon. Once I got there I waited 15 minutes for one person because there system was down. Once I got up there. Apparently the family in front of me got the last 2 spots and 1:30 was the next available. I left immediately because I wasn't going to sit there for hour to an hour an a half with my one year old son. I was telling my husband about around 12:05. I looked on the website and oh look at that 8 SLOTS were available. Either I was lied to or your system needs to be fixed. Anyways. I won't be coming here again. Even if I am in the area. Pros it looked clean. Can't say much more than that

Review: We recently moved to the area and I WISH that everywhere we have lived had something like this place. It was clean, well organized, and the ladies working the front desk were so sweet and personable. I loved that they had snacks and drinks available for purchase (as well as some super cute toy options) for my kiddos, and hot coffee available to brew for myself, as well. I loved that there were seating options available for the parents that were separate from the play area but I could still easily keep a close eye on my kids, or leave my table to go play and have no worries at all. My 5 and 3 year old loved it and we will absolutely be going back.

Review: I don’t recommend this playroom business. We have came for atleast 3 months and recently my kids have gotten sick from here because specific people keep bringing their kids here with fevers and openly talking about it like it’s not a big deal. Secondly, it’s a considerably small playroom (the smallest we’ve ever seen) and there’s an employee that shows attitude because there’s toys on the floor that she has to pick up. Today, we were banned because my 14 month old baby threw a block in the air and it landed on an older kid and the parent (male) threw a tantrum and left saying my baby did it multiple times today which is false. Accidents happen and kids are kids. We cannot prevent all things from happening. I was also told we were banned because at some point of a previous visit evidently they’re claiming my kid destroyed a clear plastic Tupperware container? I’ve never seen this happen and nobody even spoke to me about it so I don’t know what’s the deal about that but it seems my family was targeted for one reason or another possibly politically motivated. So try a different place

They also have snacks for sale if you didn’t bring your own (which I didn’t) and an area to consume them. They have an infant area as well as areas for older kids. This place was perfect for my 3 year old granddaughter. You do need to be responsible for your child and keep a watchful eye.

Review: HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Visited The Town Square Play Cafe today and my girls, 1 and 4, absolutely loved it. They have a closed in play area for the littles who aren’t quite walking yet, places such as a grocery store and veterinary clinic for the imagination to run wild. There’s a comfortable place for parents to hang with a view of the play area to keep an eye. And don’t get me started on the sandbox. When you dig a hole, the projector overhead fills it with “water” and with fish and turtles… if you build the sand high enough, a volcano erupts. VERY cool. :) The girls had a blast and were NOT happy when it was time to leave. :) While we were there we scheduled our birthday party for May! But we’ll be back before then!

Parents can enjoy coffee and snacks and soon to be sandwiches, all while watching their kids play. You don’t have to worry because you can see where your child is.

Their play stations are so educational and hands on. This literally is a parents dream to take their kids to. Not a chaotic place to lose your kids in. Very refreshing!

They keep it very clean as well. Constantly wiping toys down. I definitely will be going back often. My kids started screaming when we had to leave because they wanted to stay!

Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe.

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

Review: Our favorite place to go when the weather was hot, cold, rainy, snowy, overcast, sunny, or cloudy. We moved last month and my daughter still talks about it daily. So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Review: Good idea for a small country town, although $12 admission for a nine month old baby is pretty steep. It's like a indoor playground with a steep slide.. Your better off driving to Salisbury going to sky zone getting your money's worth if you don't have a car and just want the kids to burn energy when it's cold outside go here.

Review: I held my daughters 3rd birthday here today. Me and my family have been here one other time, and were completely SOLD. Today just sealed the deal! Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: We visited for the first time after purchasing a Groupon. I thought it would be nice to visit an indoor playground on a hot day. My kids enjoyed themselves and made some new friends. My only suggestion would be to clean the place a little more. We arrived around 10:45am and the play area looked like it hadn't been swept or vacuumed for several days. Clumps of hair in some places. The trash in the bathroom was filled up with paper towels, which suggested the trash hadn't been emptied the night before.  I would recommend having one of the young ladies sitting at the counter walk around with a hand held vacuum when it wasn't crowded and wipe down surfaces and toys throughout the day. Overall, we had a good experience but it could have been cleaner.

Review: We visited a few weeks ago on a rainy Sunday. I think the concept behind this place is a good idea- but honestly a lot of the toys and equipment seemed to be in rough shape. The staff was really nice, however our biggest issue was the larger children coming to take over the marked “infant/toddler area”. There is a sign that a specific area is designated for smaller children. Unfortunately a lot of parents didn’t seem to see this sign, and their bigger kids were coming over and taking toys, running everyone over trying to use the rocking horse ramps on the far right wall, etc. I would recommend that you either have staff inform parents that there is an infant/toddler area and to please abide by that for safety reasons, or maybe gate the area off? It was really disappointing and unless that changes I probably wouldn’t go back. It’s a good attempt at having a sensory friendly place for kids, just needs a little TLC and boundaries.

Review: The previous reviews of this place all seemed amazing and I had some higher expectations coming to this location. The place wasn't clean and alot of the toys/equipment were in very rough shape and didn't look like they had been wiped down in awhile. Staff was friendly just wish it was cleaner abd better kept. I don't think it was worth $15 and probably won't be returning.

Review: I would have rated this place five stars had it not been for the time restraints. This past Saturday we had a children party and everyone had a great time. I was sent the contract a week before my party and there were a few things that were unclear. I had visited and called a month before hand. I asked multiple questions to gain clarity and I wasn’t told clear directions. I was told that everyone would have access to everything during the duration of the party. I was disappointed to learn that it was only one hour for play and one hour to eat. The owner allowed an additional 15 minutes of play for the children however, transitioning the children was extremely difficult. Being that it was a party for neurodivergent children it took all of 10-15 mins for the children to eat. Most of the children were upset that they could not go back and play especially being able to see the play equipment. The amount of money that was paid should have allowed the children to play the entire time. If it’s a private party it shouldn’t have been cut short. It seemed like I was paying for employees to clean during the time slot I paid for. Had I known this when I had booked I would have requested a bigger time slot.

Review: This is the most inclusive place I have ever had the pleasure of taking my children to. They wait for responses from his speech device and talk to him. They offer to help. I always have my 2.5 year old and 1 year old with me and they will make sure that if I am busy with one they are watching out for the other and giving them attention. Today we had to leave in a hurry because my 2.5 year old was having a rough time and wet his second pair of pants and I didn't have another pair. The owner offered for me to bring the kids back and they checked in on me as they could see I was struggling. I am very grateful that we have this gym in our area and look forward to bringing my kids back.

They have a zipline, an area for infants and toddlers, an area to draw and color, different types (and sizes) of sensory swings and a rock wall. It's $15 per child (second child $13) for 90 minutes. I believe you can purchase an all day pass however, for $25.

Review: It is nice area for kids to enjoy, but the staff is too much, staying ready for pick up all the toys the kids play, today is time to said enough, I find him this guys talking with my son at farm market, my son said he’s don’t understand what he was saying, i see how he was stressed because my son gets to much sfuff from farm market for sure , he was very serious in his face, and my son looks scared,I’m paying you for my kids to be free time and happy , not for the guy to say don’t gets toy, if you want to keep your area clean every minute, close it will be better!
That is for kids and sure toys will be around, I’m very disappointing, im not going anymore!

Adults can also join in as well a this place has plenty of fun, entertainment, and energized activity for kids and people of all ages! Adults will also enjoy this place as well as this place will bring out the inner child in everybody! I met some pretty cool parents and awesome kids while I was here! Mr. F. has been nothing but kind and genuine and super helpful, as well as extremely friendly to all the kids in the general play areas. The front desk associate was very kind and sweet and friendly and professional too! I love the Bluey themed party area! Bluey is my favorite animated show for kids!

Review: On 5/24/25 I had a 1st  birthday party for my son upon my departure I  realizedI left his white Air Force sneakers in the bin  at your premises, I immediately contacted your staff, who assured me that the items would be safely stored until I could return to retrieve them. However, when I came back, I was informed that the items had been taken—presumably stolen—despite your staff’s assurance that they would be kept secure!
This situation is extremely upsetting and has caused me both inconvenience. I trusted your staff to act responsibly, especially after being given a direct assurance that my belongings would be protected. It is unacceptable that this promise was not honored, and that no adequate measures were taken to prevent this from happening. I am requesting an explanation of how this occurred, what steps you are taking to investigate the matter, and what actions you will take to prevent similar incidents in the future. Furthermore, I expect appropriate compensation or support in resolving this loss, including a review of any available security footage and staff accounts.

Review: I would not recommend going on the weekend or when they have multiple party’s. There were 2 fights today between parents and kids. The staff does nothing to control the rooms they just walk around smiling oblivious. I had to tell the kids to stop trampling on the toddlers and running. It was a mess from the minute I walked in there. They really do need to have more staff that helps to watch the kids when it’s that busy. I will only go during the calm, quiet weekdays.

Review: I arrived on a Friday, just before 4 pm, with my 7 year old daughter and my 7 month old son in a stroller, which was holding all of our belongings as you can imagine. We entered the building and we spoke with a young lady at the desk, who was being guided by this man, presumably the manager. She explained that we needed to purchase socks in addition to the entry ticket, so we purchased the one pair of socks for my daughter to play. Precisely upon completing the purchase, the man informed me that I would not be able to bring my stroller into the play area. Total deal breaker. I’m sure they’re aware that once they inform a guest that they can’t bring the stroller with them, most patrons would turn away. So they’re waiting until the purchase is complete to inform you that the stroller can’t come with you. Either change the policy or tell people before they purchase. So the play area itself had a few parts that either weren’t working, or none of the kids could figure out how to make it work. None of the workers stepped in to show a demonstration or explain. My daughter did enjoy herself, but I did not enjoy needing to carry all of my belongings around with us on top of my 22 pound baby in a car seat.

From the giant ball pit with slide, mini squishmallow market, police station, (includes dress up outfits), to the super intricate mazes of awesomeness (only way to describe it). This is cost efficient for anyone on a budget. My kid is so exhausted afterwards it is a win for both of us. You simply must bring the entire family and see this gem for yourself!!

Review: Back in February we brought our daughter to check this place out. We decided to book her birthday party for April. Fast forward 3 days before the party I call to confirm the party. The teenager working tells me they don’t have record of the party. I ask to speak with a manager. She puts me on hold then another teenager proceeds to get on the phone and is NO help, telling me there is no manager and I’ll have to call back tomorrow. Five minutes later I get a call from them with the phone number for the party manager. I call this number twice, no answer. I texted it and finally got a reply. After some back and forth the person informs me that whoever booked the party never confirmed it and they don’t have any spots available for Saturday. I booked this party 2 MONTHS in advance and I never heard from them at all after booking. I was so disappointed because we had to scramble to find something else to do from my daughter’s birthday. I am very lucky I called because we would have been extremely screwed if we showed up there on the day of the party. Honestly, they need to do better and have more adults who can assist rather than leaving it all up to teenagers.

Review: The place is very big and has a lot to do. However, there are grown adults playing rough in the pits. As well as throwing balls recklessly at each other. My child was hit by rough housing from an adult! The workers were in the area and did not seem to care. My daughter had a good time but the lack of etiquette ruined it for us. Would not recommend for kids under the age of 2 when it’s busy. There’s no crowd control, it gets packed, and parents aren’t careful with other children.

Review: Finally gave them a try. Not sure what I was to expect but my family enjoyed it. I wish the toddler area had more for more developed toddlers who are ready for the general area but not ready for the bigger kids or don’t meet height requirements. Not sure if they do this but I suggest offering designated sensory play times so children can explore with less restrictions and potential chaos. However, the service was great. I actually really enjoyed the cheese pizza more than I’d like to admit. We got a membership for my son so we’ll be frequenting.

Review: 100% unacceptable climate!

We have a Funville pass for the kids.  We went today to give the kids a place to play out of the heat, humidity, and sun. I was sweating just sitting at a table, and I am in good shape. The play area was a bit cooler, but all three kids were covered in sweat, back at the table, and ready to leave after 20 minutes. They normally spend 2 hours there. I won't lie, I was glad they asked to leave as I was about to suggest it myself. Go hydrated and prepare to be uncomfortable. As an HVAC tech, I want to go back with my infrared thermometer to gauge the outputs.

Review: The bathroom smelled like well water/rotten egg smell like you get with corroded pipes or something. The rest of the facility was clean and smelled fine. Staff was helpful and friendly. The pizza was actually not bad. The mac n cheese bites were good. The fruit tray was fine. The soda was like generic orange and fruit punch, but it was edible. Party room is the best deal, the rooms are quiet with good AC. The common areas were really warm and really loud. The arcade is pricey, as most are. The play area is in good working condition. Anyway, would recommend for a party. For regular play eh, too loud to have good conversation with friends if you're just in the common areas. For a party you can bring your own streamers, balloons, decor and cupcakes. Funville provides ice cream cups and pizza, etc.

Review: Owners you need to contact me!! We just repaid for our membership for 3 children, $150 per kid-to find out literally NOTHING in the ball pit area works, balls are disgusting, cords exposed, tiles not covering everything. Let’s not mention the disgusting amount of trash we saw as we got there at 10am right when they opened today. This place Is a complete hazard right now. The mats are all disgusting… the worst I’ve ever seen. Trash and food particles throughout the playground. Lots of areas broken(ring area has ropes about to break any moment. Some other moms in the area mentioned a kid throwing up recently from the second level and employees not even shutting down the building to completely sanitize- kids were walking through throw up tracking it everywhere. No wonder we all got so sick after our last visit. You are charging people full price for a facility that half works.   You should be providing a safe environment for children to play. This is far from that. Gross you should be ashamed of yourselves.

Review: You look at the website and it sells a very pretty picture. Massive playground including ball area with air cannons and all kinds of little air pressure operated tubes to send the balls through. None of them work. They show a really cool looking ropes course all included in the price. Except apparently there is one employee who can open the course and she’s not coming in today so it’s closed. I’m sorry, what? The arcade is about 50% the little crane machines we all know are rigged and the low payout ticket games. They sell the cards showing you such a great discount! Except they don’t tell you that the games are insanely priced so your money doesn’t stretch far enough to make it worth it. The play area is dirty and a lot of the foam tiles leave gaps or are popping up. The levels of straps that you see in the pictures is broken and they have just cardboard over the entrances to a potential fall hazard. If a baby gate isn’t stopping a toddler (never stopped mine at least) what is cardboard doing especially with a 5-6 year old? Because you can’t go up with them or even really see some of the back parts grownups stay on the floor. I’m not rating the food because I’m not paying for what I see other people eating. The pizza looks worse than chuck-e cheese. Overall if you want to pay $30 +the price for socks + arcade cards + over priced frozen pizza, at least do it where they care more about hygiene and safety. This is literally my first review I’ve ever posted anywhere for a bit of scope on how appalled I was.

For the price it’s not worth it unless you’re asking for your kids clothes to get dirty and sick. Obviously poor management!!!

Review: I have to say, I was disappointed. The admission cost was $48.31 per child, which I found to be way overpriced for what was offered.

To make matters worse, we arrived at 11 AM on Wednesday 12/4/2024 only to find the place closed, even though the hours listed online stated 11 am-8 pm. This was incredibly frustrating for our family. We had to drive back at 3 PM instead since I already bought the tickets online. Pictures below.

Once inside, the cleanliness was another issue. The kids' clothes ended up dirty because the area was not well maintained.

With the high cost, incorrect hours, and lack of cleanliness, there are definitely better options out there for a family outing.

Review: Great place for a wide age range of kids. Tons of stuff to explore and climb up, slide and play arcade games. They do have a lunch counter that you use your phone to order from. They host birthday parties which some of the other parents have expressed concerns about. Clean bathrooms and they also have memberships which if you twice in a month you’ll get your moneys worth.

Be sure to bring your own socks with non-skid to avoid having to purchase theirs.

Review: Honestly don't know how this place is still in business. It's completely disgusting in there. All the mats have not been cleaned and the towers are all dusty. Kids can seriously get sick from this. I would definitely look somewhere else to take your kids. This place is screaming hand foot and mouth in every corner. Another downside is you aren't allowed to follow your kids in the towers, which is difficult if your kids are younger and can't figure out where they are inside the playground.

Review: Two things to know:
1. My husband travels for work and my daughter and i often travel with him. Our favorite thing to do is explore indoor playgrounds when in a new area. All this to say, I’ve been to A LOT of indoor playgrounds.
2. I only leave reviews publicly when a place is extraordinary or extraordinarily bad. I’m writing this one publicly in hopes of saving another family money and time.

Hands down, the worst indoor playground I’ve ever experienced.

Firstly, the front desk employee was sitting in a corner on her phone when we walked in. She looked up and saw us and carried on with what she was doing. After about two minutes of this she begrudgingly walked over and the greeting we were given was: “you do know we close at 8 right?” not even a hello. To which I replied, “yes.” It was 6pm so I understood the attempt to make sure I was informed, but that wasn’t the intent as she followed with: “we WILL close at 8pm, the lights will be cut off at 8:20 and you still have to pay full price.” Trying to stay positive I said “i understand, it’s no problem.” She made it very clear that she did not want to be there and that she did not want us there. I’ve never had a more miserable encounter. She talked so fast and low that I could barley understand anything she said and when I asked her to repeat, she made no adjustment, rather pointed to something that explained what she said or repeated it the same.

It cost just my daughter and I $40 to play. We’ve been to some incredibly nice indoor playgrounds, some in expensive locations, but this is the most I have ever paid, by far. My daughter is three and very chill, so she’s right on the cusp of wanting to be in the toddler area and wanting to explore the “big kid” area. So, you can pay $15 for your kid to play in the toddler zone, which is a tiny area more targeted for babies or $25 for everything. “Everything” being the toddler area and “big kid” play area; not the arcade, ropes course or the slides. Which the ropes course area and fun slides weren’t even opened. I know all of this because I asked and instead of talking me through it she pointed to a sign I could read. So it was $25 for my toddler, $2 for me to be with her and $10 for both of us a pair of socks. We brought our own grip socks, as we do this a lot, but it was “mandatory” that we each have $5 funville socks. I have NEVER been required to buy socks if I brought our own. After I paid this, I was reminded again of the closing time and sent on my way with no further instruction. I had to ask “is that everything” because she was so vague and unbothered.

I didn’t see anything being cleaned until 7pm, when they started closing. Yes, closing down so heavily that I had to find another employee (the only other employee I saw) to make sure they closed at 8pm (even though I had been told this several times.) There is ball section in the big kid area that allows kids to press buttons that cut on air and do fun things. It was very neat and my daughter LOVED this part, however only TWO out of the 8-10 machines they had actually worked. They also have air guns that you can shoot the balls out of, probably 15, none of them worked. At 7pm with NO warning, they shut all the air off. In the middle of my daughter and I playing the air suddenly cuts off and the employee that “greeted” us came in with a bag and started rounding them up. It took me a second to figure out what was going on it was so abrupt. They were pretty much pushing us out of the door at 7pm. We left at 7:38pm (not the last to leave, still several kids playing) and it felt like we were about to get the lights cut out on us. They actually made an announcement stating that lights cut off at 8:20.

All in all, it just felt like a huge scam. Half of the attractions were shut down, others closed an hour early, being required to wear funville socks, shutting down at 7, it was all too much. A few of those things I can handle, but all of that and for $40?! I would not recommend this place to anyone. Please do not waste your money here.

Review: The kids love it here, and $12.00 Tuesday was much more reasobable. You cannot use household socks. You are required to buy funville approved socks. Typically $32.00 each child plus socks adds up! Tuesday is $12.00 + socks
You also have the option of a membership and you can load money on their card for the arcade area. The bumper cars have been removed and are no longer offered.
There is a decent menu with plenty fried foods,  you can scan a QR that has your table number already this makes ordering really fast. We went with the loaded fries, they came out piping hot. They were actually Pretty good.

Review: This place has a lot of potential due to the size and sections but it is very bad managed. We visited this place for 6+ times while paying around 100$ for 3 kids to play 1 to 2 hours. During our visits we thought that the rope coarse was broken or out of service because no one ever was using it. However we visited this week and my kids saw the place is open went on the line to only get denied access to it  because the worker is not welling to do more than one round a day. The employee opens the coarse when she feels like it and does one round ( 5 kids only) per day. Even if everyone payed the same amount to enter and even if our admission ticket is including this section, we were denied to play just because the employee is not feeling like it. This is not fair for us ( parents that paid) for the kids (why the employee only allowed some), and for the employee that is not qualified to do the job. Very disappointed at this establishment and I won’t go back again.

Review: This place is so fun!  It is located by the old Chesapeake mall.  There is a burger restaurant in the same parking lot.  They do serve food though.  I saw people eating pizza fries and soda.  There is a QR code on each table you can order from.  This is a great indoor play area. Many levels of fun for kids of all ages. The colors were bright and vibrant and fun at the same time. The play area for toddlers was large and well thought out with many safe things to keep kids busy. It was for kids under 3 foot tall.  My son loved it. A multi level play area for kids older than toddlers maybe up to pre teens.  More than enough physical activities to keep your kids busy for a few hours.  You need a power card type thing to play at the arcade though but modern and fun.  Staff was polite from the time we entered until we left.  The front desk clerk was understanding of my son’s disability and allowed me to wear an entrance band on my wrist instead of him.  The lady that was in the play area with the kids was very attentive to the entire play area.  There was also a lady in charge of the large slides and she was kind to my son who ran over several times but was then scared to do the slide.  We drove 50 minutes to check it out and were glad we did. My son loves it here. I’m sure we’ll be back soon.  This is a good place for a rainy day afternoon.  The only thing I didn’t like was the price.  We paid $40 for my son and husband to each get a pair of socks and to have free play for 2 hours.

The workers here don't care if your toddler is the right age to play in the toddler section. They would rather your child get trampled by older children. We got a refund and left. We've never been back to this location ever since. That was our first and last time there. Horrible birthday experience for my little one.

My three year old likes the foam ball area in the back, but only one of the vacuum/blower machines works out of six. My five year old  doesn't seem to mind as she's just having fun running with the other kids.  I've gone 10 times now, but I haven't had any food, but I was told it is as good as you would get from any pizza chain spot serving pizza and wings.

Review: It used to be reasonable priced, but no longer. I paid $32 for my grandson to play for one hour. That didn't even give him access to the entire playground. He only stayed that long because I kept encouraging him to stay. The one area that he always spends the most time in was not working.  He loves playing with the tennis balls and the air jets. Only one was working. By the way, your socks are not acceptable.  Anyone wanting to enter the play area needs to buy socks even those just trying to supervise their children,  which I suggest you do because they are not liable for anything.

These parents walked by numerous attendants. There are *large* black dirt spots all over the foam and when questioned, the attendants just said they clean up and anything like this is just from today. Um, what?! There’s no way that’s from one day- even with letting adults take their nasty shoes in the foam that kids are rolling all over. Absolutely disgusting.

Furthermore adults must also purchase them to enter the play area and that is to only be on the ground floor. So while it’s fun for the kids.

Review: No words to explain how awesome this place is. My 20 month old loves it so much. Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me. Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially a mom that needs to get out and socialize. Food is delicious!

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

Everyone working there is so friendly and nice, and they do whatever they can do to help you, always with a smile, have a great time, and feel comfortable. My grandson's birthday was there this past week, and everyone had a great time. They made his birthday special. Thank you Cabin Fever!!! I  definitely recommend them!

Review: Our favorite place to go when the weather was hot, cold, rainy, snowy, overcast, sunny, or cloudy. We moved last month and my daughter still talks about it daily. So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: When booking the Nestling party package for my daughter’s 1st birthday party, I didn’t see a Gracie’s Corner theme but Kama went above and beyond to make it happen! She communicated with me throughout the entire process. I’m at a loss for words at how she pulled all of the decor together and how beautiful everything looked. She understood the assignment! She was so accommodating and her service skills are excellent too! They took care of everything which was a huge weight off of me. The only negative was that their Bluetooth speaker wasn’t connecting to my device to play my playlist. Amirah, who was an excellent host, worked it out though and played my playlist from her phone. She was on point and on top of things! I was also able to play a slideshow for the adults who hung out in the cafe area. My family, friends and their children all had a great time. We will definitely be back for playtime and future events. Thank you Natural Nest Play Cafe!

Review: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

We had the absolute best experience hosting my daughter’s 4th birthday party at The Nest! From start to finish, everything was seamless, stress-free, and so thoughtfully done. My daughter and her 14 little friends had an amazing time — she hasn’t stopped talking about it since!

What I loved most as a parent was that we had the entire space to ourselves, which made it feel private, safe, and comfortable for all the kids and their families. The play area is clean, spacious, and filled with fun, age-appropriate toys and activities that kept the kids happily entertained for the entire party. No one was bored for even a second!

The party room was beautifully decorated with our chosen theme — princesses! There were colorful balloons, themed table settings, and cute little touches everywhere that made the space feel magical. The Nest team truly went above and beyond with the setup. They even took care of the goodie bags and organizing the food, which was such a huge help. I literally just had to show up with the cake!

The staff was incredibly friendly, organized, and attentive throughout the event. They made sure everything ran smoothly and that both the kids and adults were having a great time. It was honestly one of the easiest and most enjoyable birthday parties we’ve ever hosted.

If you’re looking for a fun, safe, and stress-free party venue for young children, I highly recommend The Nest. We’ll definitely be coming back for future celebrations!

Review: We recently hosted our son’s 3rd birthday party at The Nest Play Café, and it was an absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish! The space was perfect for little ones—clean, safe, and full of engaging activities that kept the kids entertained the entire time. The play area is thoughtfully designed, allowing kids to explore freely while parents can relax and enjoy the celebration.

The staff was incredibly accommodating and attentive, making sure everything ran smoothly. They helped with setup, checked in throughout the party, and made sure we had everything we needed. It was so nice to be able to enjoy the moment without stressing over the little details! Overall, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Our son had the best time, and all of our guests raved about how fun and stress-free the party was. We highly recommend The Nest Play Café for any toddler or preschooler’s birthday celebration! We’ll definitely be back.

Review: Cute place. .. but lacks the total package. One would think if you see “cafe” that it would have coffee or something of the sorts for the moms while the kids play. But there’s just keurig and water cooler for hot water for tea. They could do way better.
The other issue is the lack of music…. We went and my kids were the only ones, along with the workers child playing. We could hear the daycare next door with screaming children and it was odd with no music.
It’s a cute setup, but my 4 year old was bored before the 2 hrs were even up. I think they do more to make it entertaining.

Parents can work or just relax while watching their children play. I visited this morning with my 3yo & 1yo. They played non stop for almost 2 full hours. I liked the openess of the play area and that I didn't have to search for my child every two seconds. The toys and play equipment were super engaging and top tier quality. It made my preschool teacher heart happy lol.  I will absolutely be back with my littles!

Review: I hate to write a negative review, but I have tried to reach the owner twice by leaving voicemails & have not received a call back. I took my son there for the first time recently where he was hurt. We were the ONLY people in there & my son started screaming crying, I was consoling him as best I could & not once did the young woman who was working turn around to see if everything was okay. My son IMMEDIATELY ended up with a huge knot on his head so I asked the woman if she had ice for me (to help the swelling) & I asked for a paper towel (to wipe his nose & tears) & she moved as slow as molasses. I had to politely ask her if she could please hurry with the paper towels & she then asked “yeah, oh did something happen to him?” -__- & I told her yes… I’m not sure how she did not catch on to that, again as we are the ONLY people in there, it’s a small and quiet place. After moving very slowly with no sense of urgency, she finallt gave me some ice wrapped in a paper towel (guess they didn’t have ice packs?) & some paper towels. I finally got my son to settle down & decided to leave to care for him further. As we are leaving, I said goodbye to her & she just says goodbye have a good day…no “is he okay, how did it happen, do you need anything else?” NOTHING… I am very disappointed, especially as a children’s establishment that they had such lack of care & concern. We will not be coming back here.

Review: I’ve now had two birthday parties here-and I probably will continue to have all future birthday parties here! I drive all the way from Dover since this location is bigger (although I haven’t seen the new upgrade!), and it is well worth it.

The space is wonderful, extremely clean and everything is sanitized, and staff have been wonderful. You can’t beat the Sunday Birthday party price and I hope it never changes, so affordable!

The second birthday party I held for my 2 year old-back in April, I arrived and staff were still cleaning up from a previous event. I was stressed and panicking since we only have 30 minutes to set up-but the staff members were so kind and apologetic. One of the younger girls even asked if there was anything she could do to help, unforeseen circumstances happen and they handled it perfect.

I do wish the child limit for the parties was a tad bigger, but that’s only because I always invite too many kids 😂. Hey,  more kids and families that attend, that’s essentially more free advertising through experience 🤷🏼‍♀️😂.

I applaud this business. The owner is so kind that she was even able to sponsor a local family in the community who is struggling. Can’t wait to visit again and have more great experiences here!

Review: I attended my newphews birthday here 6/2024 this past weekend. The staff was very unprofessional. They were still decorating  room as guests arrived  it was extremely unacceptable And had their children assisting them who were not dressed appropriately! Another staff member had a crying baby in the play area upon our arrival.

It was evident that this party was not important to them as it was a rushed job. The decorations started to fall down. The inflatable animals kept deflating when they could have easily went to a party store or walmart to replace it. A custom sign that was purchased was no where to be found, There was no evidence of a themed activity. The staff was incompetent in orchestrating a party game and gathering the children together. This was the worst experience we have ever had and I would not recommend this business. The owner stated that they were understaffed and if so they should have arrived 2 or more hours ahead to ensure that it was taken care of when people have paid for a party! They did not make our experience enjoyable at all and did not make an effort to make sure that this party was up to standard.
They need to take time to properly train staff, replace inflatables when they are no longer working properly, buy decorations, and make sure the rugs  and play items are clean before guest arrive. Nest is a nice place but they have to get organized and invest in the things that matter! Please think twice before booking with this business

Review: I recently visited Natural Nest Cafe during its advertised hours of operation on Thursdays and Fridays, from 8 AM to 4 PM. However, upon arriving at 1:45 PM, I found the store dark, doors locked, and no visible activity inside. Despite attempting to call several times, there was no answer.

Having managed businesses for family members, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to closures or early closure for various reasons. However, upon checking their social media pages for any communication about an early closure, I found none.

In an attempt to gather more information, I called their Dover location, where the person who answered provided minimal information. They mentioned that if there were no reservations past 2 PM, they may close early, despite my arrival at 1:45 PM.

This experience highlights a lack of respect for both the company's stated hours of operation and its customers. Their website clearly states: 'Reservations are encouraged but not required for our 2-hour blocks of open play.' and 'We offer Open Play, Classes and Event reservations online to ensure you have a spot to play as we have limited play capacity. Drop in is offered on an as available basis only. Please call ahead.' Their website clearly states that reservations are encouraged but not required for open play, and drop-ins are accepted based on availability.

After reading other reviews mentioning other inconsistencies, and considering the significant distance I traveled (nearly 30 minutes) to visit their party space, I'm disappointed and unwilling to invest further time in visiting this establishment. It's worth noting that I solely intended to see the party space before blindly booking online and had no interest of play time during this visit. I could only imagine the further disappointment if I had children eager to play with me.

The older two just came to play with their little brother but they still had a good time. The reservation process was seamless and easy and the environment is laid back. It looks like they took someone’s suggestion and added some music for the background ambience so that was a nice touch. We will definitely be back!

Just a suggestion, having soft meditation/ nature/ or kid music playing in the background can make the experience even better.

Review: We had the opportunity to go to this location a few weeks ago and it was simply incredible!
I loved how safe the space was and that they had a separate “zone” for infants and early walkers.
You can tell the owners have spared no expense to offer amazing Montessori inspired toys.
There are so many features about this facility that I loved…the air cannon, the build your own fort, the indoor playground, the magnetic wall, the healthy food choices and co-working option.
But my favorite part, is that it’s not an overly stimulating environment.
I highly recommend this facility to anyone looking for a fun and reasonably priced place to take your infant or child.

Review: While the experience at this location was pretty good, the overall company does not abide by their promises. I do not support this company.

We got to check out The Nest Play Cafe during soft launch today and it was an absolute blast. You can reserve a play time online or do a drop in play, however, to guarantee your spot, I recommend booking a slot online. Each slot is a 2 hour period. There is tons for kids of multiple ages to explore and play with and since it’s in soft launch, the arrangement of the room will most likely change. There is plenty of seating around the room for caregivers and well as a whole cafe to parents of independent kids to work on their laptop or grab a coffee. There are shoe cubbies for shoes and socks are required in the play area. If you forget socks, they do sell them at the front desk. There is a whole book area for older kids to sit and read while the younger kids play. There is a family bathroom for use and there is a changing table as well as a small portable potty for kids. They even had spare diapers and pads! We can’t wait to visit again and are looking into their membership option.

The only recommendations I would have would be a locked area for people to put purses and/diaper bags and having the play period include 2 adults and 1 child instead of charging for additional adults, to mirror similar local play places.

Review: I was one of the moms that attended the Bluey event Dec 3rd.  This was my first time at this establishment and it is mainly for children up to 3 years of age even though an 6 year old would just adapt to the environment. This was a Christmas event and I must say there was nothing that I saw that stood out to be Christmas at all. My daughter was the only child wearing a Christmas hat for the Christmas theme.  I thought that Bluey would have had on a Christmas hat like shown on the website. Where was the Christmas tree? Why weren’t the owners dressed in Christmas gear as the organizers of the event because I certainly was dressed for the cause as an adult.  The activities were vague and some of the children and parents didn’t even know some activities were happening because it was unannounced and unorganized.  For the price, I thought the activities were going to be more structured according to the events that were listed.  We didn’t know that our children could make gingerbread houses until we were leaving because there was no announcement of this activity. We saw little children in the corner which prompted our children to join in which made us stay an extra 15-20 min to do this activity. There is nowhere on the website that you need grip socks to play.  It just said socks! Most people sign waivers when they get to an establishment so this should have been clear online when you check out. The children who needed socks were charged $5 for non-grip socks.  Why don’t they sell the socks that are required?  We asked for a refund only when we learned that some of our children didn’t have the proper socks to play and they were going to be denied play time with Bluey. I have been to hundreds of events and have paid high and low for my child to experience fun, however, this was not what I expected. This review is not to deter you from visiting this small business but for this business to gracefully understand and respect the review and experience of their customers in hopes to do better. The idea was there, it was just poorly executed.

Review: This vendor is nothing but a scam. I ordered a Gathre block set item listed as ""in stock,"" only to have it removed from their website right after I paid. When I asked about availability, they made me wait days for a response from their distributor. It was clear they were stalling.

Realizing the item was sold out everywhere, I requested a cancellation. They not only charged me 10% for this, they also cancelled the order and charged the fee, despite my willingness to keep the order.

This vendor tried to make $38 off me, knowing the item wasn't in stock. I've involved my bank to get my money back. Don't make the same mistake. Buy from the official Gathre site. If it's ""out of stock,"" it truly is.

In short, this vendor's deceitful actions show they're a complete scam. Don't fall for it.

Review: What a great concept! Our children (1 and 5 years old) loved this alternative indoor playground. Staff was super friendly and welcoming. A little more explanation would be good (f.e. „Help yourself to the coffee over there“). The concept is very close to Maria Montessori’s theory’s of learning. Everything is made of wood or organic material, non-toxic and in sober colors. It was equally attracting our baby and our 5 year old. We loved the relaxing music! Everything was extremely clean. Some suggested improvements: a step stool for toddlers would be great in the restroom. And a little further training in coffee making skills. 😊

I mean I literally felt so calm and relaxed, as I sipped coffee and enjoyed watching my little one explore the many options for gross and fine motor play, sensory play, music and games. We will 100% be signing him up for the science and music classes. Ashley was a responsive and generous host to the group of littles.

Music for grownups without lyrics and a classical version playing; very comfortable seating options for us, where you can easily keep an eye on your kid, they prioritize safety and cleanliness. The toys and activities for kids are top of the line, amazing quality, and spark joy and creativity ❤️

Review: Kids Empire is a great place for kids to play in the air-conditioning! The play set is larger than at other places and there is more variety. Parking is very easy, the space is very clean and spacious, and the staff are very friendly! My kids are up to age that they like to play together, so I bring my laptop with me so I can get some work done while they play. There are plenty of tables. They also have a good selection of drinks and snacks.

Review: Ball out is only for little in diapers and even though my little was the only one in there they made her get out of it. I have been multiple times and nobody has ever cared as long as she was in there alone. Maybe make a ball out for bigger kids too. Especially for sensory reasons.

Review: I have loved bringing my kids! I brought my oldest on a mommy/son date and liked it enough to bring both my kids with their cousins. And I just love that it's safe enough that I don't have to be next to each kid 24/7. I can find each one easily. And with such a wide variety of things to do that we can stay all day and the kids still don't want to leave at night. The staff are super friendly and everyone I have met here is so sweet too. Feels like a little community. They regularly have staff cleaning and vacuuming. I don't like how grimey a lot of these indoor playgrounds get so I appreciate that.
Key points to keep in mind:
-2 adults included in child price
-you have to leave to eat outside food (you can bring water bottles and buy food there)
-You can come back after leaving if it's the same day, just keep your receipt
-the pink slide gets as fast as a roller coaster going down, so be warned.

Review: I went with my daughter on a Friday morning and the place was not busy at all. Checking in was easy and at first I was really happy to see my daughter having fun in the toddler area. The ball pit area was large and there was a screen with games and a pipe system that I have not seen at other places. There was different slides and an obstacle course that was fun for my child.
The reason for the two star was the lack of staff and lack of attention paid to the play area. First, if there was food, I couldn’t tell because there wasn’t a menu or display to see prices. I did see a refrigerator full of drinks but i didn’t ask for the price. Second, I didn’t see any staff in the play area the entire time I was there, and that was a problem because I saw two Dads yelling at each other over something and it was getting heated but no one to say anything. Then, the most basic rule of wearing socks in the play area wasn’t enforced and it was pretty gross to see parents and one kid running around in bare feet. There was also broken equipment and the play area where there was supposed to be toys was mostly empty with a little play kitchen. I really wanted to like it but based on what I read, it’s probably to come on weekends when the management care to have staff there.

Parents are reassured by the safety guarantee and the stringent safety regulations. Even when there are many people around, each child may have their own small world of happiness and enjoy playing thanks to the generous area design.

Review: I had my daughter’s birthday here recently and it was a really great experience overall. Our party host, Emma, did an amazing job setting up all our decorations and taking care of our very large party (over 20 kids). We had never been to Me Land before and we were kind of worried due to a lot of negative reviews we saw about a month after booking. For our experience on a Saturday afternoon the facility was clean. The lobby was clean when we entered and it was easy to sign in. The play area was also pretty clean in my opinion. The floors were not sticky, there was no trash, etc. I did not use the restrooms so I cannot provide a review on that. The staff was very helpful and friendly, everyone had such a great attitude despite how busy it was. Overall we had a blast, and I think this is an excellent place to have a party. My only feedback to management would be I would like the gate to be more closely monitored. There were a few times I went back and forth from the play area to the lobby and there was not a staff member at the gate. Even though the front desk was staffed, there really needs to be an attendant at the gate at all times especially as there’s a lot of younger children (under 5) who could have easily slipped out.

Our party host was incredibly helpful and kind, making the entire celebration stress-free. We were even able to access the party room earlier than expected since there wasn’t a party before ours—such a nice bonus! The play area was not overcrowded one bit, which made it even more enjoyable for the kids and the parents. Most importantly, the kids had an absolute blast and didn’t want to leave. Highly recommend Me Land for a fun, safe, and memorable birthday celebration!

Review: The overall concept is great and has a lot of potential, but there are some important areas that could be improved—particularly around sanitation and safety.

Currently, sanitation measures appear to be lacking. For example, while shoes are removed in the common area outside the play zone, not all guests are provided with socks. This increases the risk of germs and dirt being transferred into the play area. Additionally, there is no clear signage reminding guests to wear disposable shoe covers before entering the restrooms. As a result, the vast majority of children and adults are walking in and out of the restroom without shoe covers, which further compromises the cleanliness of the play surface.

It would be beneficial to install clear, visible signage near the restroom entrance reminding everyone to use the provided shoe covers. Staff should also be empowered and encouraged to gently remind guests to follow hygiene protocols if they observe unsanitary behavior.

Lastly, around 7 p.m., there was no staff member monitoring the main entrance/exit. This poses a potential safety concern, as it leaves room for children to exit unaccompanied or with someone they may not know. Prioritizing both sanitation and safety with a few small but impactful adjustments can greatly improve the overall experience for everyone.

Review: Cool spot but no staff working besides chilling up front. First time I’ve ever seen a toddler with no pants on going into the ball pit. To clarify, the toddler was just walking around with a shirt and a diaper. It was rather offputting. The ball pit smelled like someone dropped the deuce in it and they’re not being clean sometime.

Review: This was a refreshing change from many of the other play places we have gone to over the years. The theme is unique and I appreciate the color variation. It was a nice facility and it looked like almost everything was operational (there was one jumping thing that wasn’t in use and parents used to sit on- but I don’t even know what it was).
The place is hectic, that’s expected. The area to sit in if you’re not inside the play space is kind of small. The bar style seating is nice so you can see out.
My kiddo (6) had a good time- he’s been twice and asks to go back.

Review: We have been to Me Land 2x in the last few months. Overall, I really have enjoyed it, but my kids LOVE IT! I do think the front desk workers could pay more attention, possibly clean a little during their shift. I mean the floor in the main area to sit is disgusting. I get it that kids drop thing, floors get sticky, but the 2x we have gone it was really gross. I think the bathrooms are also 2 out of 5 at best! The actual play areas though are great (one thing has been broken both times). Clearly I have come back and will again, but maybe every few hours a table wipe down or quick vacuum would help (hyper kidz is constantly cleaning as an example).

Review: While the children always have fun here because of the play equipment; luckily they don’t realize how FILTHY this place is. New management is certainly needed and should understands how to keep a facility clean.

There was someone vacuuming while they were open and not sure what the point was because you couldn’t even tell.

I had a party booked and upon walking into the room, at 10AM!, there was trash under the bench, sticky spots on the floor and seating benches and dirty tables.  Wouldn’t it be standard to clean party rooms at closing the night before?  The alleged assistant manager on duty made no apologies or compensation.

I will sway everyone I know not to spend their hard earned money on having a party here. Please get new management and get your act together.

- The inflatable thing as soon as you walk into the play area has been broke for at least a month

- They're down to three tubes on the tube slide, one of which has a big hole in the bottom

- There's a circular swing thingy with 6 swings that now has 4 because 2 of them are gone

- One of the tubes in the ball pit that sucks the balls in had a stuffy stuck in it

Review: It’s so unfortunate to give this place a low rating  because, this place is so cool and the kids love it- but the first thing you smell right away is feet. I have  been to plenty of indoor play areas, but never smell it this bad. It’s evident things don’t get cleaned, if I’m being blunt. It was super concerning we went daytime Friday , before the weekend rush and it was so filthy. it concerns me how much more  gross it will get during the weekend, as traffic increases. It was NOT busy considering daytime Friday before weekend . They have staff. There were THREE people up front just hanging out on the phone. Meanwhile, there was trash everywhere, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. 3 stalls not even useable. My husband said the boys bathroom was just as concerning. There was blood on the ground in one area Of the play zone where kids are on the ground at often as they get up from a slide.  Just a handful of things that could’ve been taken care of  during this down time. Lastly, there’s a loft upstairs of the tot area- and cubbies supposed to offer them to play/shop but absolutely no toys up there for the kids to actually play with. Just an open space without the stuff that it was built for i  guess . Anyways, I would definitely go back if it was cleaner but that’s keeping us from coming back until we hear otherwise unfortunately.

Review: I will say, first off, that my kids enjoyed this place. There are so many fun slides and play areas that we didn’t even get to check out the facility because it was VERY busy when we went (weekend). However, they need to work on managing and monitoring their play areas because there were numerous times when the older kids/preteens would be running around this place with foam blocks in their hands ready to throw it at anyone. They were also taking advantage of the slides and there was one slide, in particular, that they were hogging-this is one where you needed these blow-up tubes to sit in to go down the slide. A group of older kids were running up and down the slide constantly with the tubes, essentially, preventing other kids from going on it. My toddler and my friends’ child wanted to go down it, so once we got a tube the group of kids had no clue we were trying to go down. I had to ask them to move and to go up the stairs if they wanted to go down the slide again. They reluctantly listened, but I had to yell at them about two more times because, again, they kept running up and down the slide instead of using the stairs. This was so frustrating as a parent that there were no workers nearby to monitor/mitigate the situation. I feel like this is ridiculous that they do not feel the need to monitor certain high-traffic areas, such as the slides and the ball pit, where a lot of kids misbehave and take advantage. I am disappointed and hope that they make changes because I certainly would not want anyone else’s kids to get hurt or not have the chance to enjoy all of the play areas, just because there is no one there to monitor any misbehaving kids.

Review: This place feels extremely unsafe - first off, no maximum capacity listed in anywhere inside the facility and given it was weekend and busy felt that place was way too crowded for its size. Also the check in clerks did not check to see if waivers were signed. At one point the ceiling started leaking water and when this was brought to attention I did not see any safety measures being taken.

You may be fooled by the reasonable price option this facility is advertising but if you want quality would not recommend this place.

Review: We first visited MeLand in August 2024 when they first opened. We would have rated them a 5 at that time because the place was clean and so fun! It is now January 2025 and we are giving them a 2 star rating for various reasons. The first being the cleanliness. The photos attached are from our visit on a not so busy Wednesday morning. The amount of dust from the bathroom vents to all over the play area floor was pretty gross. This makes me think they do not clean the toys. The bathroom (women) was not clean (toilets all had something in or on them) with the trash cans overflowing. A lot of the toy blocks were bitten into and the upstairs of the toddler area where when we first came to visit was a play hospital, kitchen, etc. there was nothing. The ball pit air tube had a giant broccoli stick in it and was not working properly. Doors and steaming wheels missing off of the play cars. We did inform the staff about this but they didn’t really care too much. The lights do not work on some of the areas and one even had old pizza smeared across it. This is how I could tell the play space has not been cleaned. We asked the employees for a slice of pizza and quickly learned that they don’t even sell food during the weekdays aside from small bags of chips and soda. This is not on their website or posted anywhere in the establishment. I still gave the place a two star rating because they do have some fun attributes but overall they get a solid two.

The only reason I can’t give it five stars is because it just really needs to be cleaned!!!! We came here on a Wednesday evening, there was probably 10 kids max at the entire facility but there was so much trash everywhere. The pictures attached are in the waiting area where the tables are but even through the play areas there were leftover drinks and wrappers and napkins and trash all over. They need someone to walk around the facility and pick up after people instead of just sitting behind the desk. I can’t imagine how dirty it would be on a busy Saturday or if the place was packed.

Review: Parents beware... This is a great place for your kids to have fun, but it can be crowded. I took my children here to meet up with a friend who was celebrating her daughter's birthday and it was on a Saturday afternoon. The place was extremely crowded. There were pretty much no cubbies to put our belongings in so we had to get bags out of our vehicles put our items in the bags and place them on top of the cubbies. Everyone is required to take their shoes off if you are going in the play area so keep that in mind and be sure that you bring socks. Children are supposed to bring socks that have a non-slip bottom such as the socks they receive at other play places, they do not give these socks with admission but you can purchase them. I didn't see anyone doing a lot of sanitation with the number of kids that were in the play place so I would consider that if you have children that might be sick or are easy to get sick. You may want to go at a time where they are not as busy. The bathrooms and the floors definitely needed some attention and I didn't see anyone making moves to do any cleaning of the bathrooms or the floors considering that there was a lot of wet feet coming into the building from the weather. It was fun and the kids had a great time but I would definitely choose a time when they are not as busy if you like for your kids to be able to enjoy without having to wait due to the number of children in the location. I'm not certain that I would take my kids back often but they did have a good time.

Review: Me Land is a spacious indoor playground with some fun features. The equipment is new and clean, which is a definite plus. However, the lack of a designated area for crawlers is a major drawback.
The biggest issue we encountered was the overcrowding. It often feels like there are more adults standing around than kids playing, making it difficult for children to navigate and enjoy the space.
Furthermore, the staff seemed indifferent and even rude at times, which was disappointing.
Overall: Me Land has potential, but the lack of a crawler area and the frequent overcrowding significantly impact the experience. We'll likely continue to visit occasionally because our child enjoys it, but we hope they address these concerns in the future.

Review: I am so disappointed in this place its unbelievable. I saw this place on IG and thought it would be a great place for a birthday playdate for the kid (age 6 with a 2 YO bro). Read some reviews on cleanliness and decided to still take a chance.

FIRST there are NO ADULT managers onsite (like the oldest employee was maybe 18). The kids running the place had to call the manager for guidance or questions they were unable to answer.

SECOND I had to ask the kids working to take out the trash (bc it was overfilled to capacity), wipe the table down in the common area, and sweep. There was also a pile of trash on the floor on the other side of the common area the entire time I was there (530-8p). They never came and swept said trash that was on the floor.

THIRD the menu for food was not available during our visit and I was told they do not serve food on Fridays and but would provide pizza when reserving a party room.

FOURTH the bathrooms are in the play area where its socks only... So you're walking into the bathroom with your play socks and returning back to the play area with the same socks ... WHAT!

My kid had the time of his life and the playground itself would be 5 stars because of the various courses, games, and overall structure. What they have is nothing I've seen before at an indoor playground BUT THE CLEANLINESS... DISGUSTING... and for that I will not be going back and give this establishment 2 star.

At 10 years old, they’re growing out of some of the other indoor playgrounds in the area but Me Land had larger play structures and more to keep them engaged. I was very disappointed in the staff and cleanliness of Me Land though. The staff seemed unbothered and were on their phones throughout our time there. They also don’t wear uniforms so it’s difficult to know who is a staff member and who isn’t. They did not enforce the nonslip socks, in fact, they didn’t seem to be monitoring for socks period. There were some people playing barefoot. In the sitting area, the floor was filthy at opening. It looked like it hadn’t been swept or mopped in several days. The tables for snacking were covered in spills and crumbs. I think they have a great space but staff needs better training and the playground needs better upkeep.

Review: My 3yr old had an amazing time. Minus a star because the parents who had older children maybe 7yrs and older were not paying attention to them. They were Being mean to the younger children, running over top of them with the tubes for the slide, knocking them down and hogging the toys. At least twice, I wanted to find the parents of those children and make them aware. Other than that the place was great. Well, put together.

Review: This is my go to place from now on. We had my daughter’s birthday here a couple weeks ago and I had so much anxiety about it. However, Larrisa and Lily made this experience so pleasant. Larrisa and Lily were so kind and helped with everything; set up, grabbing guests from the front, help with food and cupcakes. The place was clean and organized. There were plenty of seating for parents and even a few massage chairs. I would highly recommend this place for a kids birthday party.

Review: Just visited  Kids Jungle Land in White Marsh, Maryland, and I can  say this place is a hidden gem for families with young kids! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm welcome and a vibrant, jungle-themed atmosphere that immediately caught my children’s attention.

The facility is super clean, well-organized, and packed with fun. The indoor play structures are impressive — colorful slides, climbing tunnels, obstacle courses, and even a separate toddler area, which I really appreciated. It’s the perfect mix of safe and adventurous.

What stood out the most to me was how engaged and energetic the staff were, Stacy and Ashley ! They  are such sweethearts!🌷they kept everything running smoothly, ensured safety rules were followed without being overbearing, and were always smiling and happy to help and very easy to talk to and very  welcoming ! This is definitely the place to bring your children. They will go home tired And out your hair!😂 Definitely worth the visit!

Review: My kids and I had a wonderful time! Absolutely no complaints on the facility or the staff; except who I’m assuming is the manager, old white lady with glasses. She was very rude to me and my family when we came in and spoke over me when checking in. She seems to make her employees do all the dirty work and not take initiative her self, if you are representing the company as the manager you should be nicer and take the initiative yourself instead of leaving it to your younger employees. I also saw her sitting down on her phone while the other employees were running around tending to other guests, which I believe is heavily unprofessional. The rest of the staff were very friendly and welcoming and would kindly inform parents and children of the rules, but every time she would come out she was rude with the children and some of the adults, I understand having policies and rules to follow but there is no need to be rude especially when talking to children. I also think if there is a problem to come to the parent if possible because most children can’t comprehend what they’re being told. Other than that, my experience was good and my family and I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend this place!! Just fix the management she is not a good face for your company.

Review: Wonderful Experience at Kidz Jungle Land – Thanks to Ms. Stacy!

We’ve been coming to Kidz Jungle Land at White Marsh almost every day, and I can’t say enough great things about Ms. Stacy, the manager. She has been absolutely amazing!

Ms. Stacy is extremely attentive to the safety of every child. She’s always alert, making sure no child is ever left unattended or near the exit unsupervised. Her dedication to keeping the play area clean and organized is impressive, even during busy weekends. It's clear she takes pride in ensuring the space is both fun and safe for all families.

She’s also very pleasant and interactive with the kids. My 4-year-old son absolutely adores her and is always excited to see her. She has a special way of making children feel welcome and cared for.

A few months ago, we hosted our son’s birthday party at Kidz Jungle Land. Ms. Stacy and Ash went above and beyond to help us decorate and manage the event. They made the whole experience smooth and stress-free for us. Hosting a party in a large, active space is no small task, but they handled everything like true professionals.

Running such a big facility smoothly—especially during weekends—isn’t easy, but Ms. Stacy and her team consistently do an outstanding job. They not only maintain the space beautifully but also treat every guest with kindness, professionalism, and a strong focus on safety.

Big thanks to Ms. Stacy and everyone at Kidz Jungle Land! We truly appreciate all you do.

She’s always personable and professional. Seems to have rapport with many other regulars besides myself. This place has made a rough patch for me and my son much more bearable and I appreciate that.

Review: I recently gave my son a birthday party here. Everyone was nice. Great atmosphere. Kids had fun for sure. We were assigned a host that made herself available if we needed her. The host started to set the room up beforehand which was a tremendous help. I love how the parents and adults could interact with the kids apart of the package. They do allow some finger foods and they provided some pizza and drinks for the children. Overall everything was great. The only hold up was waiting for people to sign their waivers. Most of my guest signed their waivers beforehand but I wish there were someone that could have helped my guest sign waivers so that I could be attentive to my guest in the party room. Lastly, my cousin had to assist me with passing out pizza and cake, which I thought my host would do. So I was very appreciative for my cousin to help since we had to be out of the room by a specific time or else we would get charged more. I would bring my kids to there again because they did have a lot of fun.

Review: My experience there is okay. We  took our son there to play indoor since it was raining for few days. The place has a nasty smell like that it hasn't been clean. The playground feels that it hasn't been clean. The plastic balls are sticky, ring around the rosy is oily and when I climb on the stairs going to the long blue slides, I smelled gas up there. Maybe because it's next to a vent on the ceiling?  Isn't  that  unhealthy for the kids to inhale that stuff? So I had my son stayed in the lower area of the playground.

They never came to check on us. We had to keep asking for plates, cups and utensils. Something that was supposed to be provided in the room. We had to ask for the table cloth. I wish I could get my money back because it wasn’t worth it. I seen the workers walk back in forth in the party room next to ours but never came to check on us once. Waste of money and I am upset.

Review: We hosted a private “Dino-FOUR” themed birthday party at Kids Jungleland, and I cannot say enough amazing things about Stacy, the manager. From the very beginning, Stacy went above and beyond — her communication was clear, friendly, and super helpful. She guided us through planning and decision-making, explained all of our options in detail, and made the process completely stress-free.

What really stood out was her dedication. Stacy normally has Mondays off, but she made sure she was there specifically for our party — and she didn’t miss a beat. She helped carry in decorations, set up the party room, and constantly checked in to offer help or handle little things behind the scenes that made a big difference. You could tell she genuinely cared about making sure everything went smoothly!

The two party attendants working with her were also fantastic — helping with cleanup, making sure the pizza and drinks were out on time, and just keeping everything on track without ever being in the way.

The kids had an absolute blast, and honestly, I think the adults had just as much fun. I’m beyond grateful for all the help and care we received. We would absolutely consider hosting another party here again. Thank you, Stacy and the whole Kids Jungleland team, for making sure our little dude had a blast!

Looking a little run down, a lot of patch work, gaps in play mats, small pieces that kept falling off peg board,  broken balls everywhere not just in ball pits, bathroom floors dirty, storage area for shoes and bags was dirty.  Inside the slides and up in the jungle gym are was clean, and staff were very friendly, I did see the one gentle man duct taping and trying to fix the spike sticking out of the spinning bench .. so A for effort.. maybe close for a day and do deep clean and replace broken balls and replace the vinyl not just tape over .. it’s an awesome place for littles would love to see them continue being successful ..

Review: When walking in, the place smells a bit like weed. I assumed it was probably from the coats in the lobby so we continued in. My daughter (18mo) had a lot of fun, she really loved it. I was not a fan of the lack of supervision preventing older children from running around the toddler area as it's not safe. I am curious to know the cleaning procedures for the facility because my daughter has a pretty nasty cold. It is sick season but additional cleaning, air filtration, etc should be in place to help mitigate this. The bathrooms could use some extra attention for cleanliness. The kids seem to love it but not as clean & supervised as I would like.

When my family was denied entry, I requested to speak with the manager, who was not onsite, to ask for an exception while I retrieved cash. The staff contacted the manager by phone, but she instructed them not to allow us in and refused to speak with me directly. As a result, my family had to wait at the entrance while I went to an ATM near White Marsh Mall to get cash. I strongly urge the owner to reconsider retaining this manager, whose arrogance and lack of customer care could jeopardize the future of this business.

We had reserved a private room for my nieces 2nd birthday party and it was everything we needed and more. The manager Stacy was very accommodating and hands on even with one arm in a cast. Thank you so much to Stacy and her staff for making my nieces 2nd birthday one for the books:).

WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!!!

Review: This place is my children’s everyday place to go. We are always here, we come here so much that I might think I’m in all the photos ppl take when they come here🤣 it’s crazy to think that they only been here for a couple of years because my 2nd child been coming here since she was a NB and now she’s two. This is where we go when it’s too cold, too hot, or rainy outside. My kids love coming here. It’s also my fav because I don’t have to keep running around following or chasing them since we inside. It might be smaller than most of the indoor playground, but I’d say it’s one of the best indoor playground, cleanest, and all age friendly in the area.

The staff are friendly and helpful, there's plenty of places for parents to sit and even massage chairs to relax in while your kids play. There's a smaller childrens area that is great for toddlers and a bigger kids area as well! Snacks and drinks are available at the counter where you check in. Hours of fun!

Review: Had my son’s 2nd party there today and from the moment I walked in the woman with the arm sling(I’m assuming the manager) had the worst attitude. Not a single child in our party was given socks. We had a “helper” that didn’t help with anything. I asked him an hour and a half into our party when we would be called to the room to eat. He said “you can eat anytime”. I didn’t know I had to request for them to call us to the room. I had to ask for gloves to serve food. I had no help with anything during the party. I missed my son eating his cake because I was passing food out. We set up and cleaned up the party by ourselves. He came in at the end to sweep the floor. I was just at a party there within the last month and this was a night and day difference to how the other family was treated. We paid well over $400. I would NOT recommend this place for your child’s party. Go to Hyper Kidz in Owings Mills instead.

Review: Kidz Jungle Land has been an absolute lifesaver for our family, especially for my son, who loves having a fun and safe space to burn off his energy! We’ve been utilizing the monthly membership, and it’s been one of the best decisions we’ve made. The flexibility to visit as often as we like keeps my son active, happy, and engaged.

The facility is always clean, and the play areas are well-maintained, giving me peace of mind knowing my son is safe. The staff is incredible, and I have to give a special shout-out to the manager, Stacy. She makes you feel like part of the family every time you walk through the door. Her warm and welcoming nature, along with her attentiveness, ensures everything runs smoothly. The staff as a whole has been so helpful, and you can tell they genuinely care about the kids and families who visit.

If you’re looking for a place where your kids can have a blast while you feel comfortable and welcome, I highly recommend Kidz Jungle Land!

The room was great, the playground was a hit with all of the kids (and some adults, too! 😜) and the staff went above and beyond. Our party host was Stacy and she was amazing. She jumped right in to help us set up, decorated the room with us and offered her expertise on what worked best in what area, and we loved all of the suggestions. She set our table instead of just stacking the plates by the food (which is what I planned to do) She checked in on us frequently and was never too far if we had any questions. The kids loved getting to run and play and the adults loved having access to the party room for a break and to have a home base for all of our guests. Every party guest said how much fun they had and how great the room and party were. We will be visiting frequently, especially as winter approaches, and will probably end up returning for his birthday next year

Review: We had a great time visiting the Natural Nest in Newark. The facility is well kept and there are plenty of activities to range different ages. AHK has only ever played at one other in-door play park, and this one was unmatched. There are so many toys for her age, and height- she's TINY! Calming music streams through the speakers as you enjoy your play session. I loved that they offered food and beverages in the case you need one. There's an ample amount of room to store your belongings. They even have high chairs if you need to feed your little ones, and shared clogs so you don't have to enter the bathroom in just your socks!

The only negative I have to say about this particular location is the lack of steps on the play gym. There is ramp with grip, but it's pretty steep and tough to climb while guiding a small toddler. The only other option is a climbing wall, which again, not super easy to navigate to the top with your child.

We don't live in DE, but I would definitely recommend Natural Nest to others in the future!

Review: Booked for a birthday party and as other reviews have said it left a lot to be desired. It was hard to tell what the place actually looked like from the pictures online. Was not the space I was expecting, but nice. There was no cafe from what I could tell, even though that’s what was advertised. Even as a SAHM the hours are very minimal. We did book a DIY party but I expected at least a little help from the staff.. the only part they DID help with was to charge people for socks and then remind us when it was time to leave. Overall not a welcoming experience and I have not taken my child back but am considering going to the Middletown location which has better reviews.

Review: The employees at this location are consistently unaware of their surroundings. They allow their own children to run amuck in the facility, they do not treat visitors with kindness, and they seem to ignore any needs that arise. The bathroom had no paper towels or toilet paper, a big kid was playing on the slide and the entire structure swayed with their weight, the employees child was running around without a shirt…
Just consistently disappointing. I would not recommend either of the locations to anyone.

Review: I wanted to love this facility, but unfortunately, my experience left a lot to be desired.

We booked a last-minute DIY party, and while I appreciated their flexibility with scheduling, the turnaround time on the details was understandably short. I was asked to provide an estimated number of children, and I was told it didn’t need to be exact—just so they could ensure enough seating.

However, on the day of the party, I was told I had to pay for the number I initially estimated.
I explained that I planned to pay at the end, once I had a final headcount. When the party ended, I again explained that fewer children attended than expected. Despite this, I was told the owner insisted I still pay for the original number, which felt unfair and inflexible.

We also paid extra for the bubble machine, which turned out to be a complete nightmare.
Within 3–4 minutes, the first child slipped and fell due to the slippery puddles the bubbles created. I asked if the charge could be removed, as it created a safety hazard. The staff member attempted to clean it with a paper towel, which only made the mess worse. She said she would ask about the charge, but I was ultimately told I still had to pay. I then asked if we could at least move the machine to a safer location, since I was being charged for it.

When I asked about resolving the billing issue, I was told to message someone, which I did.
Unfortunately, the person who responded directed me back to the same individual at the facility who had already said she couldn’t help me. It felt like I was being passed around without any resolution.

To add to the frustration, our trash can was full, and I had to ask for another bag. While the young lady helping us was friendly and clearly doing her best, I feel that her supervisor failed both her and me.

I really wanted this to be a great experience, but it ended up being more stressful than joyful.

Review: I was genuinely excited for Play Nest Café in Newark to open, as it’s much closer to me than the Middletown location. However, after today’s experience, I’d rather make the drive to Middletown, where the new licensed owner provides exceptional customer service. She’s attentive, passionate about her role, and goes above and beyond to ensure all families feel welcomed. Her love for what she does is clear—every child is treated fairly, and every parent feels included. That kind of atmosphere is what makes a business thrive.

Unfortunately, Newark’s location has consistently fallen short of those standards for me. Today marked the third chance I gave this location to change my perspective, but it was yet another disappointing experience. I understand that we all have off days, especially as moms, but the consistent lack of effort to create a welcoming environment here speaks volumes.

When my son and I arrived, the atmosphere was uninviting from the start. My son, full of excitement, was quickly met with situations that felt dismissive and unfair. Another child began snatching toys from him, and while her mother was distracted, the person in charge saw it all unfold yet chose to intervene only in favor of the other child. At one point, when my son happily tried to engage with the person in charge’s child, she physically pulled her child away from him, leaving my son visibly saddened. The lack of acknowledgment or effort to include us left me feeling incredibly uncomfortable.

In contrast, my experience at Middletown’s Play Nest Café has always been positive, thanks to the owner’s genuine care for families and her inclusive approach. Today’s experience reinforced the importance of hiring staff who align with a business’s values and understand how to make families feel valued. Sadly, this hasn’t been my experience at Newark.

As much as I love supporting small businesses, I cannot continue to spend my money at a location where I feel unwelcome and discriminated against, nor will I subject my son to such treatment. While the space is aesthetically pleasing, the experience simply doesn’t reflect the environment it should. If you value fairness, inclusion, and genuine customer service, I cannot recommend the Newark location.

I got there at 12:00 pm exact and i left within 20 minutes due to how uncomfortable, depressing etc is was .

Review: I don’t typically write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience. Today, my wife took our son to this location, and unfortunately, the staff member in charge made them feel unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout their visit. This individual repeatedly gave them unpleasant looks and displayed discriminatory behavior.

Additionally, there were children being rude to my son, taking all the toys from him, yet the staff member failed to address the situation or remind the children that the toys are for everyone to share.

We usually visit the Middletown location, where the service is exceptional, and the atmosphere is always welcoming. Unfortunately, this is the second time we’ve had a negative experience at this particular location, which is why I’m writing this review. I do not recommend bringing your children here due to the poor service.

I get the fact that you guys just opened but it wasn’t very clean in there. The blinds and the windows were extremely dusty and dirty (like very) and the sponge pit was dusty also- as soon as my son jumped in it I could see lots of dust just spreading in the air. Honestly, especially for  $16 I really expected a clean facility for my little one to play in. The main lady who greeted us was very sweet. The place itself is definitely much smaller than i imagined and felt a little underwhelming.

Review: We love visiting this indoor playground—it's truly a gem for families with young kids! Every time we walk through the doors, it feels like a fresh experience. Emily and Rebecca are always so kind and welcoming, and you can tell how much time and passion Emily pours into making the space special.

The variety of toys and activities keeps my child engaged every time we come. I love that the furniture and play areas are frequently rearranged—it keeps things exciting and new, even for regular visitors like us. They also host fun, events throughout the year. We recently attended an Easter egg hunt, and I really appreciated how thoughtfully it was set up so little ones weren’t overwhelmed. It was my daughter’s first time meeting the Easter Bunny and I am thrilled she had a positive experience.

Sometimes there’s even a themed sensory bin or fun surprise—like the day we came in and there were balloons on the wall, which my child noticed right away. There’s a cozy, clean area for nursing mothers, complimentary coffee for parents, and a snack area with child-sized tables and chairs—such a thoughtful touch. I also love the no-shoes policy, which helps keep the space clean and comfy for the kids.

It’s such a welcoming environment, and we always look forward to our visits. I recommend this place to any family looking for a safe, engaging, and thoughtfully designed indoor play space!

Review: What a wonderful place for young children! I was hoping something like this would come close to our home. We went to a similar style place in York in the past but it was not nearly as nice - the beach house play center is so clean, organized, and well thought out. The toys are all high quality and promote lots of learning and fun! Shoes need to be removed which is a rule we have in our house and really appreciate. We will definitely be returning, hopefully many times!

Review: I attended a special event with my 2 year old this week; this was our second visit to the Beach House. The event was very well run. Attendees were limited and allowed for the children to play and participate in activities without being directly on top of one another. Included in the 1.5 hour event was play, snack, a craft, and character appearance; I felt that event was well priced for these inclusions. The space was very clean and well maintained. I appreciate that toys and activities are rotated for seasons, holidays, etc. I would highly recommend open play sessions or special events to those who have kiddos 1.5 to 3 years old- this gem of a business is perfect for them and we are so lucky to have it in our community!

Review: Hey Everyone!

(Yes it says I’m from NJ - I was visiting family and this was their party)

We came to The Beach House for my nephew’s birthday party. My sister in law was telling me all about it when they opened, I wasn’t sure what to expect, and to my surprise this was like no place I’ve ever taken my 4 year old! As soon as you walk in, it’s very bright atmosphere, smells great and VERY CLEAN!  Everyone took their shoes off prior to entering the play area where they have multiple interaction sections for each creative child and all their desires.  Also the fact that there were 10 toddlers in the same room and the volume was at a 4 out of 10 I was highly impressed that something like that was even possible lol. They were so extremely engaged that everyone played so nice and quiet at each stations. Also if any of the toys are some how soiled (ie, child places fake veggie in the mouth) there is a dirty bin where you place all toys to be sanitized!! Trust me , Emily did not miss a single detail! These are things I highly value as a parent.

There was an area in the back with flooring as an area to eat and have snacks off the carpet play area.

In the back hall there was a lovely breastfeeding room with a cozy chair and privacy curtains and fully loaded diaper changing station!!

This place was a dream come true for a mom (or any guardian for that matter)
And even to this day my toddler keeps asking to go back!

I had to stop in and support our local businesses that build such beautiful space  that keeps our community connected!!

Review: Such a wonderful place, I highly recommend checking it out! I went today with my autistic 5 year old twins and their nurses and I was worried it wasn't going to go well since they have issues in social settings and are often judged for being different than the other kids. We did not experience this at all and felt very welcomed. Lots of things to do to keep the kids busy. There is even a room in the back that can be used as a calming room which is a huge plus for us since the boys get overstimulated easily. We will definitely be coming back again. I wish great success for this small business.

There's so many things to see and do, even though there were quite a few children and adults there, everyone seemed to have plenty to play with. The free coffee is always appreciated but the complimentary diapers and wipes were absolutely amazing!  We also made use of the calming area for some milk and snuggles.  Wonderful set up. Great toys and atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!

my son had a great time here for hours on an incredibly hot day and we stayed nice and cool inside. The seating was comfortable and the play area is a well padded and contained obstacle course of passages that lead to one of two giant slides and a large open court to kick a ball around. There is also a roller slide that in all the times I’ve been here have yet to see a kid come off without a smile. This place has a ton to offer and is just great to visit.

Review: We have been to Kids Empire more than a handful of times at this point and also had my son’s birthday party there yesterday. It is always clean, everything is well maintained, and everyone always has a blast. I love how the adults are encouraged to participate with their kids and there’s lots of fun things to do without having a ton of extra money-sucking arcade games. They few they have let you play till you win.

As for the birthday party, the whole experience was amazing. We chose the meal package and literally everything was taken care of for us. All we had to do was send invitations and show up. Least stressful birthday party ever.  Our party host, Rashid, was friendly, attentive, and anticipated our every need or want. He really made sure everything went off without a hitch and made sure we were satisfied with everything throughout the whole event.

I highly recommend Kids Empire for a day of fun or for a birthday party.

Review: Place needs a deep cleaning from the ceiling to the floors. I mean days' worth of cleaning.

We enjoy going to this place to escape the heat. However, every single time....and I do mean every single time I end up sick after we go there.

The dust can be seen from the tops of the playground. The rubber mats are disgusting black.

A little boy got hurt from where the game fell over on him.

I will be trying to find other activities for the remainder of 5 weeks of summer.

Im depending on you guys to clean up. I dont plan on coming back anytime soon. When I do, Im bringing a germ bacteria detector.

Get them girls who sit at the front desk texting/on their phone to start cleaning. When I come back, I want to see them wiping and scrubbing everything non-stop.

Review: Kind of disappointed with them this time . We came a few years ago and liked it . Came back this morning at opening , I was by myself with my two kids . Which both are autistic , and then 20 minutes later they accepted bus loads of students . I get it’s a public place , but I really wish I would’ve been informed that they had like a field trip or whatever coming . I would have just came back later . I paid full price and only got half an hour with my kiddos inside . I can’t keep track of two children by myself with a small room full of probably 100 some kids . I had to apologize to my kids for wasting their time , and I’m pretty upset I wasted my money . Personally I think they should’ve let me know , or just book a few hours specifically for the field trip and not accept other guests . A lot of these kids were playing in the zone meant for much smaller kids . I had kids 3 times the size of my 2 and 4 year old trampling over them to go down toddler slides . Very disappointing .

Review: I brought my grandson to a party at Ready Set Play, I have never been so appalled at the behavior of a business owner. Instead of pulling the party host to the side to say that her time was up, he basically almost threw us out of the room to set up for the next party. The arrogant attitude about his 5 star rating and how many parties he throws a year was mind blowing. So it's all about the money and how many turnovers he has in one day seems to be the goal, not the birthday experience for the child. I pray whoever reads this post creates a business that will close this business. Parents that spend this type of money should not have to endure rude, arrogant and pretentious behavior.

We highly recommend Ready, Set, Play. My daughter (20 months) had a blast and could play on almost everything! She even made a new friend. Oh, make sure you have socks because you have to buy them if you don't. They're like a couple dollars.

A great place for a kid just to cut loose. I think there should be a barrier between the kitchen and the tables. A gate between the video games and the play area. A gate between the little toddler section and the walkway. Just a suggestion. Great place.

Review: My daughter at ready,set,play. She loved it. And she turns 2 next month. It was her first time. But once they start crawling they can start going. They have a crawler area. Which is more like a baby toddler area. But my daughter still enjoyed it. This would be good for Roxie for a long time. The small playground it's good up to age 12 or something. There was a ball pit. She loved. A balloon box. If I could rate it 4.5 if I could. I loved the place for my daughter. I just hope the vacuum in the back. My daughter found a dead stinkbug and almost ate it. I'd still take her back cause there isn't many indoor playgrounds where we live.

I weigh 235 lbs, and I don't feel any of the play sets sway or wobble under me while I chase around my 2 year old. The staff is courteous and efficient, which is also amazing considering how many people they are catering to. The variety of equipment and games is also great, so your kid(s) won't have trouble finding something they enjoy. There's plenty of seating, and food available too. I highly recommend this place for any occasion. It's also worth mentioning that they have party times available. We had a great time and loved it!

Review: Nice place for a reasonable price. If you are planning a trip, you can sign the release form ahead of time by completing it online via their website. There’s a small cafe where they sell snacks and drinks. Children can run and play at one price for hours. Pictures shown is from the cafe view. There is an area for children under 7 and a separate area for the older children. The weight limit for playing is 250, so many adults can also enjoy playing with the children.

The prices are amazing, you pay and have the entire day open to close to play and have fun. Everything is big and sturdy so parents can join in on the fun too I know I did both times I've been there! Babies 1 year and under are free when accompanying a sibling, ages 1-3 (I believe) are like 10$ and 2 adults per family is allowed for free. So myself, my sister in law, my 11 month old and 2 year old went on a Wednesday for only 10$!! It was amazing. Prices for fri-sun are like 5$ more expensive but still not bad at all. So much to do and everything is very well padded so it's nice and safe. It's just a blast and I wanna live there. Lol

Love all the activities and that you can easily see from the floor area… prices are a little high when my 2 littles under 2 don’t last more then 2 hours, so I’m considering the monthly plan, pays for itself in 2 visits! But definitely recommend!! Clean and the staff are very friendly.

Review: My granddaughter had her birthday celebration here. Very large indoor playground with arcade games and a cafe. She enjoyed her day here very much.  We reserved a party room which included pizza, which was pretty good.  Cost for admission and party room rental varies by time, day, and age. Gets really crowded on weekends.

One slice was a decent size and served on one plate, the remaining two slices were served on same plate. These were actually a single slice of pizza that was cut in half and equaled the size of a whole slice. Attendant claimed these were two slices like I was supposed to believe.

Review: Rip off! They charge you $45 for 2 kids and you can only stay for 2 hours. So if you plan to keep your kids longer, which normally will happen, you end up paying $100 for 4 hours, which is a rip off for families these days. Will never come back, unless they stop thinking how to make more money and let the kids enjoy their indoors playground.

This is completely unacceptable and unsafe for children. I can't understand why alcohol is even allowed in a place meant for families. Definitely not coming back, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values a safe environment for their kids.

Review: Attended a birthday party here. It was great. Small enough that the kids can play without parents hovering. And a great variety of fun activities for the children to engage in. Love the bright colors. I would have given 5 stars, however there’s a door to nowhere next to the trampolines that many kids were confused about. And right next to that are cubbies that are not attached to the floor or anything; that, when leaned on topple over. This is a major safety hazard, especially with all of the kids running back and forth. They should take the purple cubbies next to the dirt to nowhere and block that door, which would give the cubby stability and the kids no longer have a dead end when trying to find the entrance to the trampolines. Some signs on that side saying, “this way/that way” for the entrance to the trampolines might help as well. We got trampled, bumped into or had awkward looks given by so many sweet babies who were confused as to how to get to the trampolines.

Review: Accident waiting to happen. Utter chaos on a Sunday afternoon despite the newly implemented ticket times which are a joke.  They give no indication when your ticket time is up so it’s just a constant free flow of kids.  They have zero staff supervision and allow big kids in toddler zone. I watched a baby get badly hurt from an older kid crashing into her in the toddler designated area.  There is no way this place is up to fire code. They should shut down before a serious accident happens.

It’s like a full free-for-all once you walk in which isn’t the vibe you want for the safety of you little kids.  This thing caused toddler after toddler to get slammed into the ground despite it being a toddlers only area. An employee was sitting about 10 feet away watching, doing nothing. So disappointed bc it could be fun.

Review: Junior Playland!
Located In Newton Square PA.
About 25 Minutes From Claymont DE.
A Space Themed Indoor Play Area!
My 6 year old loves space, so
We Decided To Give It A Shot …
Here is the REAL review!
This play area is THE BEST toddler play area we have been to recently.
TODDLER play area being the key word.
The have plenty of things to do for your little ones!
My 2.5 year old and my 6 year old LOVED it.
My 12 year old was not impressed at all.
They should make the age limit 10 honestly.
Because it’s not much for 12 year olds to do here.
They have a small trampoline area.
Trampoline area has 2 basketball hoops.
The soft play area is very interactive and fun.
They have multiple rock climbing walls!
The arcade is very lack luster.
Clearly that wasn’t the focus for this play area.
Birthday rooms on the second floor to accommodate birthday parties.
Overall Very fairly priced!
Very clean.
Staff was walking around wiping things down while we were in the building.
Staff were friendly.
Some of them looked miserable but who wouldn’t be getting paid next to nothing to listen to kids scream all day lol.
They do 2 hour time slots so it doesn’t get overcrowded.
This was the pricing for the weekend,
$16.99 ages 1-2
$21.99 ages 3-12
$9.99 6 -11 months
but free with a paying sibling
1 adult is  free per family.
$6.99 for each additional  adult. no in and out
2 hour open play Time slot are :  9am/11am/1pm/3pm/5pm
They do offer cheaper pricing on week days and all day passes on Fridays.
The bathrooms were clean!
They offered crocs to slip on at the bathroom and I thought that was very convenient.
They even had a toddler potty to help the little ones!
They do have refreshments.
They offer pizza and wings but do not have a kitchen they bring it in from a local business.
We had 3 slices of pizza, 3 juices, 2 star buck coffees in the glass bottle, and one can soda for $25. Very fair.
In total for tickets, food, drinks, and a few games we spent $100!
All in all it was fun and my younger kids had a blast!
We will definitely bring them back!
If you’re in the area or looking to try something new, give Junior play land a chance!

Review: WOW! What a fabulous place. By chance, I saw the sign and stopped in to check it out. Couldn't fill out the waiver fast enough to my grandson's (4 yrs.) liking. We were not disappointed. So many things to do, extremely clean, friendly staff. Music playlist was well chosen and at perfect volume---enough to hear, if listening, but not intrusive if occupied in play. No shoes for all (including adults), and slip ons available at the bathroom entrances were impressive. We happened to stop by on a Friday. ALL-day play till 8:00 at a great price. We stayed 3. If not happy with the menu, you can leave and come back. Broad hours of operation (9-8:00-except Sunday till 6:00) make it convenient for most families.

I've only written 2 reviews online (including this one). If I could have given both higher stars, I would have. I went to their website when I returned home and was surprised to see the overall rating, UNTIL I read the reviews. Look people, Junior Playland just opened in November. They're still working out the kinks---to be expected. Refreshing to see management respond to some reviews. If you are going (by choice or necessity) on a Saturday (especially) or Sunday, of course, the place is going to be more crowded. Also, my opinion--be fair---1 bad/good review per group, then just don't go back, if not happy. Otherwise, it doesn't give an accurate overall rating. Let's face it---stuff happens. Management seemed fair in how they handled those situations. One last thing---it's the adult's responsibility to monitor their child's play. Remove them from a situation, if you don't feel comfortable. Needless to say, we'll be back often in spite of the hour ride to get there.

Review: EDIT IN RESPONSE TO OWNER REPLY:

We tried to address it but you have been unresponsive to my email outreach and no phone call has been returned. You seem to only respond on Google reviews vs. actual outreaches. On the day of the party there was not a staff member on hand above high school age to assist or address our concerns. And the following day when I stopped by to discuss, you were again not available.

I don’t know who Ann is, but I’m sorry to hear she had a similar poor experience.

Having your friends post fake reviews to counter actual reviews from people who had poor experiences to try and stay above a 4 star rating is a questionable business practice.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Don’t recommend them for birthdays. They jam as much possible business into 1 hour room windows which robs people of set up time for their parties and also has new parties going into unsanitized rooms. The whole process is very chaotic and disorganized and if you aren’t actively policing the time yourself, they will not be helping you. There doesn’t appear to be an actual process they follow to support birthday parties.

They also do not have any process for crowd control. They sell two hour windows for play/parties, but they do not enforce a policy to actually ensure people leave after their window ends. This makes it unreasonably overcrowded, especially as the day goes on. Most places close for a period of time to ensure integrity of the play windows and allow parties the ability to get set up and not worry about encroaching on or being encroached on by other parties.

Other play places in the area are better positioned for these parties, and I would recommend choosing them for your sanity and to not waste $700 on a free for all setup.

Review: This place is disaster! Disorganized and overly crowded. Upon checking in for a party, they didn’t even take our name or name of the party and just gave us a wristband. Dont know the capacity here but it was well over 200. No control here.

Review: We hosted a birthday party at Juniors Playland for our 4 year old and it was so great! The staff was so helpful and so kind. They did an excellent job of assisting with set up and hosting the party. They also provided decorations and pretty much everything needed to have a great experience. The play space itself is vast and has tons to do for all ages. Would highly recommend all around for either a fun play date or to host a birthday party!

Review: Absolutely terrible experience having my toddler’s birthday party here.

First thing we walked in and it was absolutely packed and way over capacity. People were not even getting checked in nor were time slots being verified. It was absolute chaos all over the play areas

When it was time for our party room there was zero coordination. I had to find our room myself and get all our guests into the room (they told me the wrong room number) AND THEY LOST ALL OUR FOOD AND CAKE. An employee literally walked me from party room to party room looking to see if other parties were being served and eating our food! Finally they took me down to the area behind the desk where they all proceeded to just stand there yelling at each other with no one knowing where our stuff was. Eventually I walked past the arguing employees and went to look for it myself and found it was tucked in the back of the storage area.

Even though we were within our guest count for the package we purchased there was not enough room in our room, we had guests sitting on the floor eating pizza with their kids. Additionally, our package included juice and utensils, which we never got and had to ask for forks for our cake ourselves.

When we asked to talk to a manager a teenager came over and said “it’s not our fault”

Upon returning back home, we realized that an employee had collected some of the gifts from our guests when they entered but we never received them. So our daughter is now missing some of her birthday gifts.

I was so embarrassed by this entire party and I spent the night apologizing to our guests and sending up follow up apology messages to our attendees. For how much we spent on this I cannot believe this is what we got…

EDIT IN RESPONSE TO OWNER’S RESPONSE:
I disagree with this rebuttal, the owner was not present so I am relaying my experience. I personally was taken from room to room to look for our food while other people were having their parties (as I mentioned earlier). It was not located in five minutes and I was the one who found the food myself and had my husband personally go down to carry the cake up himself in fear of another mishap.

I did not mention the power outage as I understand this was not in anyone’s control and all the concerns I’ve outlined occurred prior to the power outage. However, if the gifts were meant to be delivered to the room as part of set up and the power outage happened after we were in our room, then how did the power outage affect visibility of the gifts in storage? It feels like the power outage is now being used as an excuse for bad services rendered throughout the evening.

For having spent almost $700, this was not the service i was expecting

Review: They allow way too many people in at once putting in profit over safety and experience. Could be a cool place if it wasn’t a zoo. The baby toddler is inundated with too many adults and kids too big for the area instead of allowing the little ones enjoy. My nieces kept getting trampled. The flying ball thing in the center needs to move because you’ll get smacked in the face when walking by.

Review: This was my grandchild’s birthday.  Our food was lost.  The child’s mother found it after 6 teenagers were trying to manage a clearly over capacity crowd and they were clearly overwhelmed.  A manager over the age of 18 should be onsite.  The power went out, which was out of everyone’s control but no one offer assistance or flashlights to illuminate very dark party rooms.  All in all a difficult experience, especially for the child.  We are rushed out of the room at the end of the hour with our guests telling us they left the child’s gifts with the front desk at check in.  Too bad the front desk did not deliver the gifts.

Edit in response to owner,
I was one of the last people to leave the place.  No gifts were left on the sidewalk as none of us were given a bag of gifts.  So, how did the gifts get outside on the sidewalk?

Review: My kids (3 and 10) had a blast but there’s definitely room for improvement. We did the 11-1 session on a Saturday and it was overcrowded. Kids were tripping over each other. Also it didn’t appear the 9-11 session got formally “kicked out” which could account for the overcrowding. It would be nice if they closed for 30 minutes between sessions to clean because nothing was in its right spot (eg. doctor kit in play hospital, food in play store). Also the layout feels tight, there’s a spinning attraction with balls hanging from it and people trying to walk by kept getting whacked. We’d probably go again but it would be nice if these kinks could be ironed out.}","Pennsylvania","juniorsplayland.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","19073"

Review: Could not recommend this place enough! We stopped in with our 11 month old to get out some energy on our drive home to Pennsylvania from Myrtle Beach South Carolina which was the perfect idea, she immediately fell asleep after we left. The two owners (i’m assuming) were super sweet and hospitable. The place it self was super clean and cute overall. They have 2 family bathrooms too which was a big plus. They have a section for 2 year olds and under which was a hit with our daughter, she did also enjoy the swing, slide and rocking horse in the big kid area. Over all it is the perfect place to burn off some energy and spend some time inside when it’s too hot outside.

I love every section they had in there and it was very clean! And they also have Miltary discount on reservations and in house purchases! My only suggestion which isn’t even necessary would be to put lights and other wall activities under the main play ground cause I saw a lot of kids running around under there, mine included! Overall 5/5 stars and would highly recommend! We want to get a membership there now!

Review: The place was nice, but it's unfortunately pretty hidden and not easily accessible. I live close by and had no idea this place even excited!

PROS: The space is clean, and not too busy if you go during the week due to its low location-visibility. It's great for older kids between 7 and up, and even for adults who want to get some exercise on an obstacle course.

CONS: While the space is nice and the staff were friendly, the layout of the rooms and equipment was a bit disjointed and doesn't flow well. There is one block of cubbies in the main area, which is fine if not crowded, but nowhere near enough for a busy day. There are only a couple benches in the main area, with the only tables being in the back corner of the small kids area which aren't immediately visible. Everything felt very closed off and compartmentalized rather than open and accessible like at the other locations. Equipment is pretty limited for older kids and very little to do for toddlers. The one section they do have for younger kids is basically a three -part section of magnetic building blocks that won't hold a toddler's attention for longer than maybe 20 minutes. The obstacle course is pretty basic, and when not busy, it can be fun but on a crowded day, I don't see how kids can fully enjoy it due to the layout.

The cafe and the play area are completely separate, with the cafe being on the top floor when you come in. So, if you want food or a drink you can't easily pause and go over to a table, you'll have to walk up a flight of stairs and completely exit the play area, which I super wasn't fond of.

I also wasn't fond of the flooring. The mats used were just slightly thicker puzzle pieces rather than the thick foam padding that's seen in other play places. Because of that, I worried the floor would still be a bit too hard if falling from a higher height, definitely for my toddler (who still wanted to play in the bigger area), but even for a slightly bigger kid.

Additionally, there is zero cell phone reception in the building, so I couldn't even pull up the waiver when the staff asked me to use the QR code. You need to connect to the WiFi if you want to have any access to your phone--also a strike for me.

All in all, this is a great place for older kids and I love the proximity to where we live, however, I was a little disappointed there wasn't as much age-appropriate things for my 2 year old to do because of the type of equipment available. While I'd still recommend this place if you have older kids, you might fare better at the other locations for the younger kiddos.

Customer service: Joselyn was incredibly professional and helpful and made our time at Parkour an absolute breeze. She was so welcoming and made we 10/10

Cafe: Delicious 😋 the chef was attentive and she made our pizzas and fruit tray with perfection. I look forward to coming back and enjoying more the menu options. 10/10

The Parkour Park: Our family loves Scramble and have celebrated many birthdays at each of their playgrounds. This one is different, but in such a good way. It’s a place for the kids who really enjoy the jumping and swinging part of indoor play. The magnetic blocks are a nice touch for a break from obstacle courses. Best part….no loud music! Just the sounds of happy kids playing and having fun. 10/10

We will definitely be back! Thanks for another awesome day of play Scramble, Parkour was so much fun.

Review: We have enjoyed every scramble experience we've had. Recently due to a original email, we found out they had a parkour location, Shirlington. Which is wild because I'm in this area a lot and had no idea because it's around the corner from most of the main strip. But we were already coming down to see a movie and decided to check it out. When we arrived we asked how long it had been open and they said since December. We came down and there were only two other kids in the space. The space is beautiful, large, and looks like a ton of fun for kids. Even some fun for adults that are adventurous. Another parent was here and we asked if is it usually this empty. As we were here on a Saturday just after noon. He said this was his third time and it was always this empty. More people need to come to this location to make sure that it stays open. It is really a great space!

I went upstairs to the cafe to grab us some coffees. They have a hole barista setup in addition to actual food and snacks that you can get in the cafe. All reasonably priced.

Not shown is a smaller kid building area of soft magnetic blocks. That is quite large and mostly fenced in.

Pricing is typical to other scrambles. I look forward to coming again.

Review: Decided to host our son 8th Birthday party celebration at Scramble Parkour, shirlington.   Best decision, EVER!  We were greeted by several staff members who gave well wishes to our son.  After getting checked in, my son was given a very cool yellow drawstring back pack that he could keep his shoes inside of while he played. This particular location only has tables for hosting parties, and other locations have individual rooms.  Our party hostess was “Jocelyn.”  She was amazing, any questions or concerns were answered and our entire party experience was top shelf from beginning to end.  Our kids played (and played) before the party, and there is a HUGE play area located downstairs with the most interesting wall artworks that I’ve ever seen before in one place.  The facilities were clean, and both tables and chairs were being wiped down and common areas were free of trash and debris as well.  Would rate the entire experience a 10/10 for the amazing staff, amazing decor and store location.  If you’re looking for a convenient location to host a kids party or somewhere to take the kiddos to get that restlessness out before bed, check out Scramble Parkour, Shirlington, VA you will not regret it.

Review: I think it’s a cool place that needs some improvements. It’s aimed at older kids 8 and up but there are things for younger ones to do. Overall it works but is too expensive for how bare bones it is. Maybe come on a weekday to check it out so the price will match what you get better. Could use some background music, nothing crazy but even just soft music is better than nothing. The staff were very friendly and informative. Artwork is amazing

Review: The concept is nice and my kids had a great time but a few things miss the mark. First off, the prices are extremely high. For two kids, two parents and grippysocks, we paid $70 and I paid another $23 at the restaurant. This is a lot of money for 90 mins for two kids under 5. The cafe/restaurant is on the upper level and the play is on the lower level. There is limited seating benches in the play area and with younger kids, you have to be helicoptering over them at all times due to safety on the play structures. The biggest disappointment was the food prices, quality and quantity. 5 Dino nuggets for $5.50, the entire 5lb bag from Costco is less than $15. Over a $1 a nugget is insane. A generic brand Mac and cheese for $4. I thought them having a restaurant in-house meant better quality food than your average indoor play space. Overall, I am not sure I would visit again soon due to the price.

Review: This is not scramble as we know it, and that would be okay accept for a few reasons.

I have a 4/6 yr old and this setup is extremely limited for under 5 yr olds in my opinion. The inflatable obstacle course isn't safe for under 10s, as the supportive padding is extremely poor and won't soften your child's fall. I got asked 4/5 times
"" Do you want some ice ? "" The area downstairs is awkward for parents with no ""REAL"" place to sit or watch your child play. Unfortunately at Scramble Parkour you're better off watching your child the entire time due to concerns about falling & safety etc.

We've been to scramble a ridiculous amount of times in Fairfax and enjoy the experience. I think this facility missed the mark unfortunately, and for that reason we won't be headed back anytime
soon.

I hope this location can listen to some of its customers and make changes where necessary.

Good luck

Review: Attended scramble parkour with my 2 year old and had an incredible time playing for most of an afternoon. He loved the magnetic building blocks and enjoyed having a go at some of the basic parkour equipment. The staff were very friendly and everything was very clean.

This is a very different setup from other scramble locations and I can see why it has drawn some criticism from parents for not having adequate seating for accompanying adults. It seems like given the nature of the venue and the age range accepted they don’t really have a choice but to force parents to follow their kids around which wasn’t a problem for us but I can see this being off-putting for parents looking for a break or quiet time to get work done.

Review: I've visited this new Scramble location 3 times in the week that it opened because it's a terrific asset for parents of young children in the Shirlington area. While it is a smaller space, it offers enough activities that kept my 1-year-old engaged for an afternoon (which is a rarity!). The cafe is very kid-friendly, which was excellent for getting quality food in a lower stress environment. I'm very happy that Scramble Parkour is in the neighborhood!

Review: I absolutely love this place for my 18 month old.  It is one of the few toddler play areas that is just as much fun for the parents as the kids!  My toddler and I both love building with the blocks, running around, climbing, bouncing, rolling and just generally having a good time.  Art work is all local and stunning, too.  The place has a cool and slightly edgy feel to it, not like most kid places.  Staff and owner are super nice, too.

Review: They advertise & charge for teenagers (up to 18yrs) yet there are kids as young as 3yr olds on the VERY limited choice of equipment. The safety padding everywhere is too thin and cost us a trip to the hospital.
Due to the swinging/suspended style equipment, when kids lose their balance, they fall uncontrolled onto yoga mats instead of 2ft deep foam blocks as seen in places like the trampoline/rock climbing parks.
Over priced, under equipped, unsafe, give it a miss! Rather go to a normal scramble, not this parkour knockoff!

Review: Very, very underwhelming. Brought my 7 and 9 year old boys and there were only two obstacle courses, one of which was pretty boring. I’m also required to stay with my kids because under 8’s need to be monitored at all times, but the play room is downstairs and the cafe and chairs are upstairs. So I’m just sitting on the floor observing my kids play with soft blocks. Regular Scramble has much more for the kids to do and is much more conducive to parents having a coffee and working on their laptops while being able to monitor their kids. I was planning on this being 2 hours of playtime for them while working but doubt we will be able to stretch it to more than an hour and I will be sitting on the floor watching my kids who are perfectly capable of playing with soft blocks on their own…

Review: it was an okay experience. I was at the scramble in shirlington and they had no places for the adults to sit. they had no restroom signs and it took me awhile to find them. They also made me watch my kids even though they are 11 years old and know how to handle themselves. They  kept telling the kids they couldn't play with the younger kids in their area but the younger kids couldn't play with the older kids. The staff looked bored and uninterested the whole time and kept following your kids around even though they were being watched by me.  Overall it was okay but they had too many rules and it wasn't fun for the parents or kids.

8yo son had most fun being timed by staff member on a “course” climbing on/over/through obstacles (next to the magnetic block section).
No place for parents to sit. Cafe upstairs looks nice, but not practical since they expect parents of even 8yo to be within arms reach in certain (not blocked off) sections.
$26 (weekend) plus $6 for socks (unclear if you can use non-scramble grippy socks).

Review: We like the Scramble Alexandria location a lot, but my kids are aging out of it, so we tried this new location aimed at older kids. It’s very aesthetically nice and new, etc, but it’s missing the most crucial aspect of the other scrambles: nowhere for parents to sit. Literally not one chair. Staff informed me when I paid the stiff entrance fee that I needed to stay “arms’ length” from my “little ones” (my kids are not little) at all times. One of the staff even started questioning one of my kids about where I was, because I was in line of sight but not immediately with him. So they’re basically saying you can’t have more than one kid per adult, or the kids have to be right next to each other the whole time.  I assume saying this is an insurance thing, which they’ve attempted to enforce by leaving nowhere for adults to sit.

The owners should recognize that it’s not enough for kids to like it. Adults also need to be comfortable in it. There’s a good reason this place is so empty. I hope the owners reconsider their business model here and focus on the things that made their other locations popular.

Review: There are some fun areas to play for kids of different ages. However, there are no chairs or benches in the whole play area. Parents have to stand the whole time or sit on the hard floor.

The staff were also constantly telling kids rules, like no running, no big kids in the small kids areas, no small kids climbing the walls for big kids, no throwing the soft blocks, no outside food or drinks allowed upstairs at the dining tables, etc. There were no signs labeling where kids of different ages were allowed to play.

You have to wear grip socks, and if you don't have them then they charge you three dollars per pair. It would be nice if they mentioned this on the pricing on the website.

My friend went a different day, and the staff closed the place an hour early because there weren't too many kids there, but they did not tell my friend this when she paid to enter, and they offered no refund.

My kids, ages 8 and 5, have had a lot more fun at the other scramble locations, and I was more comfortable with somewhere to sit. We probably will not return to this one.

Review: I was extremely disappointed with the lack of care and safety precautions at the Scramble Parkour location in Shirlington. There is a 7-foot-tall, heavy box in the children's play area that can easily tip over. When I alerted a staff member, they moved it against a pillar, but it still isn't secured and could easily fall and seriously injure or crush a child. This is completely reckless and unacceptable for a facility marketed to families.

In addition, the inflatable objects suspended from the ceiling swing into the sprinkler system and lights, posing a clear risk of damage to critical safety systems. The design also allows kids to easily reach the sprinkler system pipes and hanging lights. This is not only dangerous but also suggests poor planning and disregard for proper safety measures. I also noticed broken electrical conduit.

I’ve visited other Scramble locations and have never seen issues like this. It’s baffling how this facility passed inspection with such obvious and dangerous oversights.

Review: All Scramble locations are excellent. However, there’s an all-new Scramble, Scramble Parkour where children and teenagers can run, climb, and vault their way through challenging-yet-safe obstacle courses.

Have you heard of Scramble Parkour?
August 6, 2024

There’s an all-new Scramble coming soon – and we think you’re going to be thrilled when you see it. Scramble Parkour will be where children and teenagers can run, climb, and vault their way through challenging-yet-safe obstacle courses. Scramble Parkour is an activity gym where adrenaline meets adventure. It offers thrilling obstacle courses for children aged 4 to 18 to tackle. To give you an idea of what’s in store, the obstacle courses are like those on TV shows you may have seen such as Wipeout or American Ninja Warrior. Each course is graded for difficulty, allowing kids to test their limits and level up as their skills advance. Some courses serve as individual tests; others are great for side-by-side races or team relays.

There are also free-play zones for infants and toddlers. The whole family can have fun at Scramble Parkour! In fact, since it has areas geared specifically at teenagers, we think our new offering will be perfect for families with older kids who thought they had “aged out” of an afternoon at Scramble.

Review: I visited Joyland on 7-1 with my 3 children ages 1, 5, and 8.

Pros:
1. Great location
2. Lots of parking
3. Very clean facility and bathrooms

Cons

1. Young girl working was on her phone as she completed my transaction and answered my questions. It’s nothing more rude than when young people have their AirPods in and are holding two conversations at once. There were times when she was looking at me but talking on her phone.
2. It was 78 degrees inside on a  95 degree day. Their air was set to 64 degrees. I don’t know if it was ventilation issues or AC issues but it was hot. You are not allowed to bring food or drinks inside. They have water fountains but they are near the bathroom (I don’t drink water fountains near bathrooms iykyk) They have a water bottle refill station but you can’t bring bottles in so it doesn’t really make sense.
3. Their price per child no matter what their age, is $15.99 for 2 hours. One adult does enter free with children. There is no different price for younger ages which was shocking to me. HyperKidz and Scramble even have a different price for toddlers vs older children. They also don’t have different weekday prices vs weekend prices.  Paying $16 for a space where my one year old could not even use half of the equipment was unsettling.
4. The space is small. It is the size of the surrounding businesses. I was so happy to have a place close to home but for $16 per child I will take my kids where it is half the price and they actually have more things to do.
5. They require non slip socks. Every indoor playground I have been to requires socks but not non slip socks. The non slip socks are a money grab. They look similar to the sky zone socks but nothing in there is slippery so I really didn’t understand the non slip socks. As I looked around almost every family had them which confirmed for me it was a money grab. Their website also didn’t have the socks under their admissions tab.

I will not be coming back. I really wanted to support a new black owned business but it seems like a money grab for the size and what they have to offer.

Review: We had an amazing time celebrating my son’s 3rd birthday at Joyland! The staff was welcoming and very attentive, and the entire space was safe, clean and full of so many fun activities.
The party room setup was super adorable—colorful balloons, kid-friendly tables and chairs, light refreshments, and everything was arranged so neatly. The kids had a blast!
I highly recommend Joyland for anyone looking to host a fun and memorable kids birthday party.

The space is so perfect and allows for parents to have great visibility of their children! The ball pit area is extremely interactive. The toddler area is so fun and perfectly secluded from the bigger kids. Overall 10/10. Prices are awesome too, and the birthday packages are the best in the DMV!

We were even more excited to learn that we could plan our birthday parties and much more here. I am already looking forward to booking and scheduling my son's birthday party here.

This space is a gem in Brandywine and we are so excited that it is here.

Review: Overcrowded, unsafe for 3 year olds when the big kids are running through the main play area, if you have a 6 month old and 3 year old, the 3 year old cannot go with you into the “infant crawlers” area. If you decide to strap on your infant to accompany your 3 year old, you still have to pay $10 for the infant to enter the space.

Lots of tables for caregivers. No outside food allowed. There is a cafe where you can buy food and snacks. They don't allow shoes, even for adults, so don't wear white socks like I did. Plenty of free parking. Not very busy on a weekday early afternoon. Reasonably priced.

Review: Do not waste your money on booking a private room here for a party. No AC which is apparently an issue they have and have had according to other parents that were at our party.

We paid $750 for a private room and ended up standing outside the room the whole time because of the heat, should have just paid for the smaller package with the table so we were not stuck in a super hot room.

The service was really bad and they didn’t even have my add on food and drink order that I placed many weeks before the event. By the time the add on pizzas came for the adults, it was time to leave. They were so slow to respond to email and there was no way to call and speak to a person. On top of it, I was double charged because they never refunded me from my previous reservation from when I upgraded my package!

Really disappointed with the experience and was not worth the $900 at all that I paid. I will not be booking another party with Scramble again.

But this one had a little extra to offer, because they have facts and reading areas all throughout the play structure, giving kids a chance to play and learn at the same time. I would definitely visit again. My son is 9 years old. I also participated, by climbing through the structure and helping to guide him safely👍🏾⭐

Review: Today was our first visit to Scramble FC and while it was busy, that’s expected on a Saturday afternoon and it didn’t really impact our experience since our baby is only 9.5mo so we stayed in the infant area closest to the entrance. Our baby really enjoyed the sensory room and socializing with the other babies (he’s a really social little guy!). We were also impressed with the selection of books in the little bookshop and ended up purchasing a few for our little guy, and kept some in mind for the future!

The staff were all very friendly, but I wanted to give an extra shout out to one of the cleaning workers, Ana. There wasn’t a moment in the 1.5-2hrs we were there that I saw her and she wasn’t on the move - wiping tables, vacuuming, and I was pleasantly surprised when she even offered to take my dirty food tray from me when I got up from our table, fully planning on having to take care of it myself. We live in Lake Ridge/Woodbridge but my parents live a block and a half away so we will absolutely be coming back!

Review: Review of Scramble party:

I have usually avoided scramble on the weekend unless we were attending a birthday party, however, when my son‘s birthday party at another location canceled less than 40 hours before due to an icy walkway, Scramble went above and beyond to help set up a replacement Saturday morning party at the exact same day/time, with only ONE day notice.

Scramble saved the day! They were so kind to offer us the one available room, which happened to be larger and actually accommodated our larger sized group quite well. They were flexible and accommodating with our food needs, and went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed during the party time. Madelyn coordinated setting everything up with me while my son played the day before, (his actual birthday- when school and his school celebration had also been canceled due to a water main break). Madelyn and her colleagues were very attentive during the event, despite having more than one party to attend to simultaneously - Not to mention what an absolute sweetheart Madelyn is!!! Since the party was booked with such short notice, she was so kind to give me her personal phone number so I could update her with my evolving guest list later that evening and ask any questions I still had after closing on the night before.

I’m grateful for this fantastic play space so close to home and the kind people that work there!

FYI with parties they have a strict policy that after the pizza and cake at the end, no guests are allowed to go back into the climbing apparatus for more play time without incurring a large penalty fee. The party ends after the food. We didn’t have any issues with this because I bluntly announced it to our group after thanking them for coming, and would recommend clearly expressing this rule to avoid major fees.

The food is really good for what you would expect at a kid-place like this. For lunch (we also went to play the day before the party when we set it up) I had a generously portioned salad with Korean bbq chicken, pears, pickled onions and olives and it was really good!

Beware little kids sitting on the three-leg stools. We had three kids fall off of them at the party, resulting in some tears.

Also, I know you don’t want to go in the maze with your kid, but I was glad I did at least go through with him once- I was really impressed how well everything was set up inside and what a nice variety of things to explore and little spots to hide out! There was one spot where I barely fit through and had to roll between two vertical padded rollers, bottom-first to keep going! It was hilarious and I highly recommend you try going through the scramble mazes, and have this fun experience with your kiddo(s)!

Review: DISABLED PERSONS NIGHTMARE. If you have a disability…beware! First time I went I was angrily confronted by a staff member for bringing in my own food when I have dietary needs. Went again thinking maybe it was just a one time problem, but today I was singled out and harassed for having a SMALL mobility cane that turns into a chair as I cannot stand for more than 10 minutes at a time due to my disability. The same staff member from the previous incident came over and asked me to move out the way because I was blocking the path. Except, I was far to the side, there were more people standing in the “path”, and not to mention they do not have any space for people to sit because they allow so many people in there at a time. I told the employee there were other people standing blocking the way, and that they should also be told to move if i was, but i did not hear her tell a single person. Not to mention if someone was in a wheelchair there would be no room. My daughter had fun last time but it’s so crowded, we prefer to go to luv2play in Fair Oaks. They are kind and have many open spaces for people with disabilities, and they aren't food police. They sell their own food at luv2play too but they allow people to bring their own which is nice because kids get hungry and need snacks. Also people aren't made out of money and typically buy snacks in bulk to make it cheaper. Please do better for the disabled community and if someone doesn't look disabled don't just assume they are trying to get out of spending money. Also maybe try setting a capacity, that many people would not be able to get out in an emergency. This place is just pure chaos. Some staff are really nice and caring but unfortunately there are many that are rude and and will literally verbally attack and bully people. This is just not acceptable.

Review: This place is so overrun and so overpriced. They charge so much on the weekend and don’t seem to have an occupancy limit so it’s extremely overrun with kids. They restrict the quiet area for babies so even if your child needs a quiet spot due to sensory overload you can’t go in. But it’s not sufficiently blocked off so it’s hard to get an older toddler to understand. Just a massive money grab.

Review: First time and will not be returning. The staff are fine, definitely an understaffed facility with very little safeties in place. When I got there there must have been over 2-3 birthday parties ongoing with the regular Sunday crowd there. There are no wristbands, no one checking kids coming or going. Honestly anyone could come in and grab your kid if you weren't paying close attention. If there was any kind of emergency it would be a complete and utter disaster. I had my child in the infant/crawlers area and big kids were just running around nearly falling over her and I had to police them myself which I didn't want to have to do but it was not a safe place for babies.

Part of the appeal of these places is letting kids run free which I have no issue with, but there were no safeguards in place for kids that were not being watched by their own parents and there just simply isn't enough staff to make sure safe play is being observed. And, frankly it is not really staff's responsibility, it's the parents'. I have been to many an indoor playground/gym before. This is by far the most expensive and the worst one I have been to. There needs to be an actual limit on the number of children in this building at any given time. I know better, do not recommend to other parents, and will not be coming back.

Review: Safe and lots of fun. I initially thought it was pricey especially because adults have to pay to come in and watch their kids. But they do keep it very clean and it’s well cushioned for falls. It gets very crowded - standing room only for adults. Our only concern is how hot it gets, the temperature is always kept quite high, and hot air rises. The highest levels of the playing maze are stuffy and sometimes steamy. Food is school cafeteria type of food. I asked my children to provide this feedback and stars numbers.

Review: Overall good experience if you can afford the party prices. The Pizza ain't worth it, better to visit neighboring spots for the same price. My only let down was the inside play area had a few exposed spots of worn out pieces of floorboard that needs to be replaced. Could easily hurt a child since it hurt me as an adults with toes. Would I recommend? Not for me, I'm more of an amusement park or one of those outdoor playgrounds with obstacles if the cost is the same.

If advertising an enclosed and padded environment, I would think they would spend more time with regular inspections. They need to replace those worn out exposed spots before some child does get injured.

Review: Excited when we saw a sensory room but upon entering the area I was rudely asked which kid was mine and I told the employee who said “yea your kid is too big, you can’t be in here.” That set the tone for the rest of the day.

While I understand you may like to have a “baby” area, it troubles me that you put the sensory room in this area where not all kids can enjoy this. My child just turned 3 years old this past week and has trouble with sounds, speaking, textures, etc. A parent should not have to explain this to anyone and should be accepted more naturally and at the very least in a play place like this a sensory room should be for any child no matter their age.

*Edit - I appreciate your quick response and I completely understand your thinking. Your gesture of a different play time is not unseen but yet part of the problem that people think kids with any type of disability should be excluded and given a different time frame when they should come just to be avoided. Thanks again for your quick response but at the very least change your wording of the room, possibly make sensory rooms for each age group during business hours, or allow all in the room with more supervision. Just some thoughts and to help keep all included.

Review: Quite a disappointing experience for my one year old. There was only one slide she could go down. The baby sections were often frequented by older kids. The older kids’ play areas weren’t sectioned off, so I was constantly pulling my toddler away from them, which led to tears.

It would probably be much better for older kids, maybe 3+

Review: Exceptional play area for kids!  Also has a surprisingly good menu of food and drinks for kids and adults.  The staff are uniformly nice and helpful.  They are all great, and I have particularly appreciated the front-of-house manager, who I believe is named Nichole, who really goes above and beyond in being welcoming and supportive.

Review: A Fantastic place for birthday celebrations or just to have the kids run around and have fun. The staff is excellent. I had the pleasure of working with Jennifer, who is a Gem, in organizing my sons birthday. She was there every step of the way, coordinating the event making sure everything was smooth from beginning to end. Her customer service was superb and very much appreciated. I would highly recommend this location.

Review: I had high hopes for this place but I was more then just disappointed after just one visit, I was very upset to say the least.
This place sells alcohol! I mean supporting drunk driving with children in cars? Come on.
Also, there is someone cleaning the equipment sometime but we were all pretty sick after just one day (a few hours) of being here. I think its because they let too many sick children in here. We saw and heard several children coughing their lungs out for the whole time we were there and nobody said or done anything.
Also, parking is pretty bad, they certainly don`t have enough parking spaces for the amount of people they let in at the same time.
Also, it is dominated with older children who are quite disrespectful and nasty to other younger children.
Overall, this place isn`t for us and we wont be coming back ever again.
Edit* To  owner. I never called anyone a drunk, I said drunk driving, there is a difference but I guess you have a need to be mean, not me. Also, the person I saw didn`t just drink one glass of alcohol. What does it say about you if you cant benefit from a honest review, but instead you get upset about it? No need to banish, we would never go back there even if it was free.

Plenty of parking, a little expensive but it’s a nice area so what can you do, good seating for the parents and if you have a designated driver there’s good local beers.

Review: So I’ve been here about 5 times with my 16 month old and it’s been great. She’s a little slow to walk so the area for crawlers and cruisers is great. And I’ve never had to have an uncomfortable conversation with a parent because the staff have been great about enforcing the division. Very clean and I always see staff on the floor. The food options are good. I personally don’t go on the weekends because I think it would get pretty chaotic but if you have older kids that would probably be fine then. I will say it’s probably going to be hard once my toddler is firmly walking and can’t go in the sensory area anymore because she loves it so much. But there’s tons of other spaces to play. They also have a little bookstore which is cute. My only suggestion would be a bigger ball pit for the older kids.

Review: Dominated by older kids in all spaces. There needs to be some division of space for toddlers. And our 1 year old got kicked out of the ball pit because it’s apparently for kids who are only crawling. We ended up leaving as there is not much space for our son.  We will be going elsewhere.  Doesn’t feel all too clean either.

Edit: a day later our son started to have diarrhea issues. This place is a do not recommend

Review: I've brought my toddler here quite a few times and we love it. There's plenty of activities and I like there is some division of age groups. Although, my toddler was an ""early"" walker and then sometimes staff would say we couldn't be in the age appropriate area for little-er ones.

I got the month pass in June and it was definitely worth it- I hope they continue to offer that, especially since sometimes toddler is in a good mood to play and other times just wants to run around for 15 mins before wanting to go home.

The only negatives are I wish the ball pits would get replenished and parents would tell their older kiddos to be more careful of the littles ones and not play too roughly around them. The food is also quite over priced. My little one has some specific dietary needs and once the manager let us eat outside and come back in, which was very nice.

Overall, highly recommend, especially if they offer the month pass.

They can't even sit up they mostly sit in their car seat and can't even crawl.
This is shameful and not a good business practice. Also they do not allow strollers inside which is ridiculous.
Avoid this greedy business which is not baby friendly.

Review: Grew up in this area and since having kids of my own it’s nice having a place that’s indoor where they can run around while you get to relax.

I would recommend this place to any parent and littles.

Don’t hesitate in coming here or to their other location.

They got food (snacks) that you can buy and various play areas for all ages.

The price is kind of high, but it’s worth it.

Showing me how to update it later if needed. I found everything to be neat and clean. There were signs of wear as would be expected, but it was all clean and well maintained. The kids enjoyed it tremendously and experienced some good exercise as well. Definitely and over!!

Review: Great place when the weather isn't not great to keep the kids active. The current rise in price to $18 per hour up from $12 is significant, especially when you have multiple kids you are taking. Also, taking out the Ninja course was a disappointment for arcade games. I feel the ninja course was much more beneficial than the games that they can play at home. I am sure it has to do with money, but still, we thought it added more value to our jump time. We have looked into hosting a party here and although they do a great job with parties the requirements for ordering only food provided by them is what keeps us from booking bc it's way too expensive and you don't get much bang for your buck. Still a great place to take the kids to get the wiggles out. 4 stars only due to pricing.

Review: From the moment you step inside Launch Pad Trampoline Park, it’s immediately clear that this isn’t just a place to jump—it’s an experience designed to thrill, engage, and bring people together. My recent visit with friends and family was nothing short of phenomenal, and I left not only physically energized but mentally refreshed. This review will explore the many facets of Launch Pad that make it deserving of a solid five-star rating, from its outstanding facilities and safety measures to its exceptional customer service and atmosphere.

First Impressions and Atmosphere

The first thing that struck me about Launch Pad was how clean, spacious, and well-organized the facility was. Many trampoline parks can feel cramped or chaotic, but Launch Pad has managed to strike the perfect balance between excitement and order. The staff greeted us warmly at the entrance, walking us through check-in and safety procedures with enthusiasm and professionalism. The layout of the park is thoughtfully designed, with designated areas for different activities, which helps manage the crowd flow and ensures everyone has space to enjoy themselves safely.

The vibrant colors, upbeat music, and high-energy vibe made it easy to forget about everyday stress. It’s the kind of environment that appeals to all age groups—kids, teens, and adults alike—making it a perfect destination for families, birthday parties, and group outings.

Activities and Attractions

Launch Pad goes far beyond just a few basic trampolines. Their variety of attractions is what truly sets them apart. Of course, the main trampoline area is expansive and filled with interconnected trampolines that allow for continuous, high-flying fun. But the real magic lies in the extra features that elevate the experience.

There’s a dodgeball arena that brings out everyone’s competitive side in the best way, with soft, safe balls and bouncy floors that make every game feel like a real-life video game. The basketball dunk zones were a huge hit, allowing both kids and adults to soar through the air and experience what it’s like to slam dunk like a pro. The foam pit provided a safe and fun way to practice flips and tricks without the fear of getting hurt, and the obstacle courses were both challenging and hilarious, encouraging friendly competition.

What I appreciated most was that each attraction was designed to engage the body and the mind. Whether you’re trying to conquer the ninja course, balance on a slack line, or time your jumps for a perfect flip, you’re building coordination, strength, and confidence without even realizing it.

Safety and Cleanliness

As a parent and a cautious adult, safety is always a top priority when choosing a recreational activity. Launch Pad takes safety seriously. Every participant is required to watch a safety video, and there are trained staff members stationed throughout the park, keeping an eye on jumpers and ensuring rules are followed without being intrusive.

In terms of cleanliness, I was genuinely impressed. The park appeared well-maintained, with staff frequently walking through to tidy up, sanitize surfaces, and make sure everything was in top shape. The foam pits were cleaned regularly, the bathrooms were spotless, and even the trampoline mats looked well cared for. You can tell that the management team takes pride in maintaining a safe and sanitary environment for all visitors.

Customer Service and Staff

Every single employee we interacted with was kind, helpful, and clearly enjoyed working there. Whether it was the front desk staff explaining how to sign the waiver, the team members supervising each activity area, or the snack bar attendants, everyone went out of their way to make the experience enjoyable. One staff member even offered to take a group photo for us, which was such a small but thoughtful gesture.

destination.

Without a doubt, I give Launch Pad Trampoline Park a well-earned five stars. I can’t wait to go back, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable, action-packed day of fun.

Review: Update: You do have control over it because you change the rules everyday. I guess the signs don't mean anything if they don't go by the rules on the signs.
I already left a review on their page but figured it wouldn't be up. I am very disappointed I have taken my son here three times during regular jumping hours when he was under 3. He had also been here a fourth time during little jumpers hours when he was younger. Nobody, out of the three times mentioned him having to be over 3 to jump during regular hours. I told him all morning we were coming here and the lady (young lady) said he has to be 3 because there are too many kids there now. BEFORE she said this I said there are two of us he will be 3 in a week. We have been here 3 different times recently, and it wasn't an issue. So now my child starts crying and I can't even get him into the car seat because he already hears kids laughing and playing. He also kept saying in the car ""I'm too small"" while he cried which made me feel horrible I said no your not too small they're just closed today so now he thinks he was turned down because he is too small. The lady wasn't all that nice. I don't see what the big deal is and for being a place to make kids happy it sure did the opposite. Maybe if the workers were a little older and had their own children they would know how traumatizing and disappointing this can be for a 3 year old... almost 3. I left two photos below this was months ago during regular jumping time when he was under 3. My child is big for his age and I always jump with him it shouldn't have been an issue. If there is a rule it should be consistent. I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to.

There is a large jumping area and foam block pit, basketball hops, and great arcade. There is a fox court up stairs overlooking the jumping area. You do have to purchase special socks that have grips on the bottom. The cost is close to $20 an hour per person. There are areas for parties.

Review: Brought my kids here to have a little fun before a doctors appointment not realizing my almost 2 year old was not allowed to jump. Not even sit on the trampolines. Absolutely ridiculous. They should really consider having a toddler area so moms with more than 1 child/children of multiple ages can enjoy this establishment.

Review: I took my son and grandson to burn off some steam! My son lost his glasses in the foam pit. I was assured that they would look for them. I called back today and they said they clean it out once a month! I said can you make an exception, I was told NO! So I paid $36 for jumping but lost a $600 pair of glasses because they won’t clean the pit, which my the way was filled with socks, stickers, etc..  I’m not happy about it the customer service! The jumping was great but otherwise I wouldn’t recommend!

7/11/2024
I called again, they still say they have looked all they can but until they empty it in a MONTH there is nothing they can do! I told her that he cannot see without them, but still they said they could not ( I think WILL not) make an exception and clean the pit earlier. So meanwhile my son has no glasses. I plan to call EVERYDAY AND UPDATE THIS REVIEW!

Review: We've been here a few times for Little Launchers and the kids always have fun (2yo+4yo). It's a great place to let the kiddos burn off energy in the morning. Recently I mis-read the schedule and arrived on a day they had cancelled Little Launchers due to field trips and I was very upset - my son was hyped all morning about going then we had to turn around and go home because they were closed. I was disappointed, he was disappointed, it was a tough day leading up to that point. I wrote a letter to management about the situation and received a very heartfelt and sincere apology from Mike, the DoO. This is the kind of service I love to see from a local place - Mike really took the time to write a personal email back to me and make things feel better, along with an incentive to return. The only reason I'm rating a 4 instead of a 5 is because there are sometimes open seams between the Velcro pads that cause a hazard. Otherwise, we love it here and appreciate their customer service!

Review: This trampoline park is not recommended if you have been to a good trampoline park before. We have several in the area we are from plus have been to parks in other states while on vacation and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. There were many conditions that were hazardous. Employees were trying to manage all the unsupervised but there is only so much they could do when the children wouldn't listen. In the hour we were there we witnessed multiple children getting injured due to unsafe jumping conditions, each child was offered a slushy after injury 🤦🏻. They are clearly admitting people over what the proper capacity is of the location. Additionally, there was an extremely strong smell of urine though the park. In the women's restroom only two of the three toilets would flush, the flushing handles would just spin all the way around. This place is really small too, smallest we've seen. I guess for a town that has nothing like this available it's good, but if you've ever been to a park you won't like this one. If we had been able to see inside before we purchased tickets, we would've left.

Review: Wonderful place and great fun for the price. My only complaint - please make it cooler inside the facility. It's always way too hot inside and my daughter specifically doesn't like going because she gets so hot so quickly. If they just made it a good 10 degrees cooler, this place would be hands down 5 stars.

Review: Tldr: ok at best, no kid food options
It was ...ok. Nice structure but small, brand new bounce house, but small, and the slides were a hit, but also only one attraction. The whole thing looks sad and dirty. I found a bloody bandaid in the ball pit, which honestly is to be expected, but just pointed out other hygienic deficiencies. The ball pit is one thing, but construction fencing for walls and dirty floors are just... sad. My kids, 2 and 4, were no longer interested in the entire facility within 1 hour. Then, they do not allow outside food, and the only food options are the Green Cafe. The Lamb Gyro WAS AMAZING, but my kids aren't going to eat that. There were no options that were kid centric and no options for any sort of snacks, healthy or otherwise, outside of ice cream. Unless major change comes we will just opt to head to Hagerstown or literally anywhere else.

I’d rather not have to keep driving a half hour to Hagerstown to enjoy Ready, Set, Play when there is a perfectly good place right here in town.

I wish there was someone dedicated to the slide because parents are letting their kids climb up it and so others can’t go down. Other than that I recommend this place and the bonus is their food space will be open in 10 days!!!

Review: Not a huge fan of this place.. the playground is alright, pretty spaced and skimpy on the ""obstacles"".  The game area is trash, a DOLLAR PER game.. and half the games don't take the poker chip you're given to play them.  Plus the plugs are visible and accessible to the children with cords on the ground.
It was clean, but I wasn't too keen on the idea of using the bathroom without shoes (no shoes for children or adults past the entry gate)
Also, had to wait a decent amount of time before someone showed up at the front desk to ""check"" us in..
We won't be back.

Review: Pros: big open space, various activities, cool slides with inner tube things, blocks, ball pit, just great stuff overall, seemed pretty clean, bathrooms were clean, staff was super friendly

Cons: no separation by age; 15-year-olds were pushing past my 2-year-old. The floor mats weren't flush so the foam puzzle bits came up and caused trip hazards- my kid ate the floor twice & so did a few other kids, blocks had chunks bitten out of them(pretty par for the course of foam blocks though lol), and some of the suspension work was twisty carbines which came undone, not life or death but a kid falling onto the safety net might mess up their day

Overall: fun play place, kids enjoyed their time & we will be returning!

Review: This is a very nice play area for the kids. Great location in Martinsburg right off route 11. It’s very clean and the staff is super friendly. The play stuff they have is really cool. I know we will be coming here a lot. One thing I would recommend is for them to get a monthly membership. That would be a great add.

Review: I went with a friend to Kids Empire for a play date. And it did not disappoint. The play area is huge! There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.

Came for a birthday party and workers actually seemed to enjoy their job and had fun with us. Even dressing up as the dragon and entertaining the party and birthday girl.
Thanks to Lee and team.

Bathrooms were clean and dry. I wish they had paper towels tho, instead of the Dyson hand dryer.
Stools were handy for kids to wash their hands … shockingly not a lot of kids places have that… surely helpful for the moms.

The structure is huge with lots of things to do and there is plenty of space for parents to sit in (also very clean!) Friendly staff. I do think grip socks should probably be required as it could get slippery in there, but it’s not a deal breaker for us. Will definitely come back!

Review: Perfect place for kids anytime of the year but especially during a Vegas summer!!!
Staff are great with wiping down slides and making sure everyone is taken care of.
By far the best kids place in Vegas.
$20 all day. Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.
Today is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.
Plus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)
If you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…

Review: We were going in for the 1st time to let our children play. It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.

I hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.

This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.

Review: Absolutely amazing experience at this children’s indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how incredibly clean and well-maintained. One worker JADE never stopped cleaning the entire facility. Star is the manager on duty. You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.

One of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.

We brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.

Highly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!

Review: My husband and I have enjoyed seeing Willem and Liz work hard to get their Play Cafe up and running. They are passionate about their vision, and I love seeing something so positive move into our neighborhood. My husband and I got coffee today, and it was really good, as was the chocolate chip scone. The inside is so cute; kids will love playing here and creating core memories. I wish them the best and can't wait to see them succeed. (this is your neighbor, Jessica, by the way, Burger says hi :)

We played nonstop and the children never got bored! The party room for our lunch was set beautifully for the graduation lunch. The Star Park is a clean and welcoming environment and I would recommend it to any parent or teacher in the area!

Review: We had my son’s second birthday party here. We were greeted by Haven, who was very energetic and nice. A lot of the guests for our party arrived late and the employees were mindful of this and allowed us to have our pizza/cake time after our designated time. We appreciated them extending that kindness. Our room was decorated nicely and I appreciated not having to add much to their standard decor. The overall play space is decent, albeit, it’s definitely on the smaller side. Our party room was meant for 10 children and 10 adults, but it was very tight and several of the adults didn’t feel comfortable coming in as it felt too cramped. For the price they charge, they should definitely allow kids to continue to play after the 2 hour party slot. They expect another $22 per child after  your $500 2-hr party… on top of that, the area remains open to the public and it gets way too crowded, especially when you have little ones. It costs about 2k to reserve the entire space. We were fortunate that it wasn’t too busy at the time we had our party but I wouldn’t bank on that being  typical experience for this place. All in all, the staff was friendly and helpful, the space was fun for small children, but definitely way too small and priced high.

Review: I had my son’s fifth birthday party here and from the get go I was impressed by this place. They have a pamphlet with all the party options. With the party they decorate the room- and the basic decorations they supply are absolutely stunning. I got the basic birthday package and the ballon’s and decor were amazing. They even gave us invitations with a QR code to the waiver. The park itself is a blast, very clean, and meticulously maintained. The customer service was out of this world. Anything we needed they were there at a moments notice. When they saw my son’s cake was Mario themed they surprised us with Mario coming to the party. The kids were so excited. This was a party my son will never forget and I won’t either because the customer service and entire experience was out of this world. 10/10 cannot recommend enough.

Other than that, the kids enjoyed, the staff were very friendly,  it was clean. I would bring the kids back to play.

Review: We have been regulars at Totsville for some time now and it is a great place to take the kids! The price is cost effective and you get your money’s worth with the amount of time you can spend and the experience for your little ones. The place is clean and often workers are walking around vacuuming which is nice to see! The sand pit is a super plus and keeps the children entertained for hours. The play structure is also engaging and inviting for the children. There is a separate space for younger children which is nice to have for the little ones. It is never overly crowded and is the perfect way to engage in play!

I don't want to think it's because of my Hispanic race, but I didn't receive the same treatment as other people. I recommend the place, however, she is very rude. You can check her cameras if you want, she knows it.

Review: My 2.5-year-old loved it. It was large enough for him to navigate independently while remaining visible to me during play. Like most play gyms, it smells like a gym, and the bathrooms weren’t as inviting as they could have been. However, overall, the play fixtures and sandbox were a hit with my little one. We’ll be back.

Review: Clean, tidy, and friendly staff! Everyone was in such good spirits. I thought my toddler might be too wild for an indoor playground, nope we fit right in!

Apparently I was wrong I am amending my previous review. Upon our most recent visit, there is now the playground police at Totsville. ""Don't touch this, don't touch that."" If you don't want children touching something maybe don't put it at an indoor playground. An employee grabbed a toy from my toddler but did absolutely nothing when another larger child hit my 18 month old. I don't think we will be returning, no matter how clean the facility is.

My 2 year old was able to play in the entire place. There were multiple areas where she could play in and 3 slides! What I really loved was that the staff was cleaning while we were there. You could see how clean everything was! I enjoyed taking my daughter and she absolutely LOVED it!

They ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT !!! and, they are all STILL talking about the FUN TIMES they had that day !  It rained that morning ... An outside party would've been a disaster. No worries being inside, as I watched it raining ! The Staff made sure everyone was having a great time, too ! Megan and Elvin explained everything so well to me, when the arrangements were being made - answering all 100 questions I had ! An A+ to everybody at TotsVille ! ⭐👍🥇

Review: We had a fabulous time❤️ The young man working the front was very helpful and kind, even when it came to our 10 year old playing in the small area, he approached dad calm and quietly and expressed the rules and regulations for the tot area and dad relayed the message to baby girl. It was so refreshing because you have so many adults fast to approach a child and he didn't, he approached the parent as needed and was very sweet about it. I seen another young lady vacuuming keeping the area clean for the little ones. It was really fun and we didn't want to leave. We will definitely be back💗💖 Thank you totsville.

Review: Kiddo loved the big sandbox and all the toys in it! She's 2, so particularly I liked the *idea* of the area by just for smaller kiddos. But the one downside was there was no real enforcement of that, so as the morning went on and more kiddos showed up, there was a group of bigger kids sprinting around, including in that area, as I saw more than one kid (including her) get knocked down by them not paying attention (and unfortunately their grownups didn't seem to be paying much attention, either, to helping direct them to better areas to run around/reminding them to be careful of others).

Its climbing areas are only 1 story tall so it’s easy to spot your child from the ground. They have great slides, ball pits, a giant sandbox and some really cool tubes. One thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness. The floor was spotless. The staff were courteous, there was even a coffee machine, not that we used it. They also had an area where they can climb a wall, build blocks, etc. It was crowded but not so much that he couldn’t enjoy himself and I didn’t lose track of him. They also had a bubble machine which was kind of cool to see go off every once in a while. I think we would definitely go back to this place.

The entire place completely reeks of urine and you can literally feel the moisture from the grimey carpet on your feet. The equipment was broken and obviously dirty. $30 and we only lasted 20 minutes due to the smell and overall condition of the place. Today was the first time I went in years and it will definitely be my last.

I’m not sure if there was a sign on the door that said closed for private event but there were 2 families that popped in and stood up front for quite some time during our party which was awkward for us to eventually tell them they’re not open to the public at that time so that would be my only feedback.
We can’t wait to come back!

Review: My son and I both love going to Little Valley Café. It’s a great way to get out of the house and be around people who are in similar life stages, even if no one engages in conversation. The café offers a variety of coffees and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I do wish there were more options on the menu. The bathroom is absolutely charming and thoughtfully stocked with little details. It’s clear that the owners have spent years perfecting this concept and it is apparent. Keep up the amazing work, ladies!

Review: Oh. My. Goodness. What an exceptional place to hold a toddlers birthday party. The staff was so kind and helpful! The place was immaculate and ready for us when we arrived! The party went off without a hitch! I am so grateful. I appreciate that they offer services to cover all of the needs of a party, but that they allow you to bring your own if you prefer. We had my daughter's ""Tea for Two"" birthday and were able to use all of our own custom items and still enjoy everything that the play cafe has to offer.  I cannot recommend this enough as the perfect party spot!

Review: Very very cute place. Perfect for toddlers. My 5 year old had a lot of fun. My 7 year old was really too big, but I drug him along! Parents camp out in chairs and tables, so on a crowded day there is no room to sit. Having little lockers for parents and not allowing the keeping of chairs would be helpful for the functionality! A little pricey unless you stay for the day, but great for kids to have fun!!

Review: We LOVE visiting the Little Valley Play Cafe!    It’s a great place to cultivate your little one’s imagination and for them to socialize with their peers! You can definitely tell a lot of thought was put into every detail from the layout of the play area to the small extra touches in the bathroom! The cafe itself is also a wonderful expression of comfort. We highly recommend you have lunch sometime and try the mac and cheese! Peak times definitely seem to be in the mornings so if you would prefer a smaller crowd check them out after 12 on Tuesdays and Wednesday for extended hours till 5:30. Knoxville has waited a long time for something like this and we are excited to see this place grow!

Review: Little Valley Play Cafe has a lot of potential, I feel the space they're in very much limits that potential. I took my little one here to try it out. The front desk area is tiny making it difficult for everyone to both check-in + grab your shoes (they make you put your shoes in a small cubby at the front upon arrival) as you're trying to leave. I do love that it's gated at the entry so no kid can escape. I did not feel the staff I encountered was very friendly. I had trouble opening the gate and she didn't help but another patron did. I do not like that they don't allow you to bring in your own food. I already pay for coming there, I don't want to buy the snacks you have. I don't eat lots of the ingredients in these foods and snacks and I don't want a dessert coffee every time I go. I like the idea of the cafe, I do understand it needs to be profitable, but my family doesn't eat what they serve. Makes it hard when other indoor playgrounds we can bring food in and eat at their designated tables. I don't like that so much of the space is taken by tables and chairs for parents. A lot of parents were sitting at the stools by the wall watching their kids. And then they leave their left drinks on that wall which leaves the drinks open for little kids to come and drink from them before their parent can stop them. I also didn't like that in order to go use the restroom you have to wear your socks. I'd like to be wearing shoes when I go in a bathroom... That's gross. And then any germs from the bathroom are now on socks that are walked around in the play area. I will say that bathrooms were pretty clean when I visited which is very necessary and appreciated. The themed play stations were great, my little one loved them. I love how creative they were designing that. I did not love that a good chunk of space was taken up for a party area. I just don't see how this space was a good choice for an indoor playground. I think this place could be amazing with some improvements. Customer service is very important and employee/owner attitudes I feel set the tone overall. I look forward to watching this place improve and hopefully grow.

Review: First the helpful things to know, then I’ll give you the reason for my 5-start review :)
1. Check the hours and get there early. They often have a line outside to get in and they reach capacity often.
2. Be sure that the kids and guardians wear or bring grippy socks. If you don’t have any or forget, they do sell them there for a very reasonable price.
OK, now onto the reason for my review.
I can’t say enough great things about the Little Valley Play Cafe and the staff! I went to a birthday party here and everything was magical! The staff arranged for all the decor and the food and of course provided a very clean, safe space to play. I enjoyed playing with the kids in the play areas at first. Then sat by and watched as they continued, while I sipped a delicious latte from their coffee bar. It’s so much easier to keep an eye on the kids with their open floor plan and safety gate. If you have or care for kids under 6, this place is a must. Great for birthday parties, rainy or cold days, or any day really. Whenever you go, you and the kids will be in for a real treat!

Review: Just Go!! I visited this week to check it out for the first time with my 2 kids since opening with a friend and her 2 kids. It was an absolute blast! We ended up going a second time because it was so much fun -- and not to mention the coffee was fantastic!

There was an incident that happened while we were there of no ones fault, but I watched the owner take amazing care of this sweet boy. After he was all taken care of, they offered him a Good 2 Grow Juice and he got to pick his top. He was back playing in no time. It's always great to see how much an owner cares about their patrons.

Love this place and look forward to it becoming a regular stop for us. I will say it can get busy in the late mornings/afternoons, but I love to see the success of a new business in town. If you want to visit when it's a little quieter, I recommend going in the earlier morning hours.

The owners did amazing job of thinking through things. There is so many fun sections for the kids and the quality of the cafe is top notch. A great new spot in town!

Review: This place is fantastic. The drink and food options for adults and kids are 10/10. You can tell the owners put a lot of thought and effort into everything. The little dips coming out of each playhouse could use some grippers or something since kids easily slide with their socks. Also it would be so appreciated if the person checking people in can politely say something along the lines of, “and we just want to confirm that no one entering has a runny nose, cough, or fever today?” We can’t avoid asymptomatic people… however, the last time we went, I saw a mom cover her kids mouth when they were coughing and then the same mom took a toy out of their kids mouth, wiped it on her shirt and then tossed it back on the floor. I just wish the whole “please don’t bring your kids if they’re sick” thing was enforced somehow. I still refuse to give this place anything less than 5 stars and still very much recommend it!

Review: This play cafe is super cute and modern. It smells clean! Kids playing in here love it and never get bored. As a former preschool teacher, I’d say the play is perfect for ages 1 (walkers) to 5 at most. I would highly recommend someone on staff to keep toys continuously organized throughout the day, so kids experience each center to its full potential. With the success of this business, I also recommend them to expand into a place much larger (small gymnasium size). Other than those things this type of business is an excellent concept. Keep being successful!

Review: There should’ve been one of the staff members resetting the toys and play spaces periodically. It felt like a kids playroom that hadn’t been cleaned up in days. We sat and ate for 30 min when we arrived and the toys were never reset. My kids couldn’t really engage with the toys or spaces tripping on other toys or seeing nothing on the shelves of the little play rooms, and toys mismatched between the spaces. My kids also came down sick 48 hrs after being there. Overall just wasn’t a clean and inviting space. One positive was the food and snacks at cafe were great options and variety.

It should be noted however that during peak hours (on Saturday at least), it was a little crowded. So if you have multiple really young kids, it might be best to go during a time when it’s not so crowded.

Review: Yes, I'm posting a picture of the shelf in the bathroom. Why?

Because today, when I took my toddler to play and stepped into the restroom, what I saw captured everything I'd felt since we came through the door.

At Little Valley, I truly felt that my son and I were so welcome exactly as we are. It is CLEAR that this place is run by fellow mamas; every little detail has been considered! The layout is designed so caregivers can watch their little ones while they sip delicious drinks--and by the way, those drinks are hand-delivered to you, so you don't have to take eyes off your child.

But back to the bathroom shelf. Here you see tampons, baby wipes, breath mints, dental flossers, doggy bags (iykyk), and more. They've stocked everything a mama might need to take care of herself AND her baby in there, and they've done it in a way that is more beautiful than it has to be.

I knew I was taking my baby for a treat today. I just didn't know I was giving myself one too. We can't wait to return.

Review: When this place first opened it was amazing. However the last few times we have been in the place has been dirty. The bathrooms were dirty, not stocked and needed trash taken out. The floors need a really good sweeping and mopping. The tables look like they haven’t been wiped down in weeks. Some of the bouncy toys are so filthy that I don’t even think a power wash could save them at this point. It’s unfortunate that the staff doesn’t seem to care. The person at the desk is just eating snacks and watching videos on their phone and always seems annoyed when people come in or ask questions. The way the building is designed you could easily get up and go clean and still be able to see guest walk in. It would be nice to see staff cleaning and wiping down toys periodically especially during cold season. It’s unfortunate that it’s gone down hill.

Review: Kid Zone is a hidden gem in Powell, offering a fun and safe indoor playground perfect for young children. As soon as you walk in, you’re greeted with a clean, vibrant space filled with a variety of activities for kids to enjoy. There are climbing structures, slides, and even a soft play area for toddlers, ensuring that children of all ages have something to do.

One of the best aspects of Kid Zone is how well-organized and well-maintained the facility is. You can tell that cleanliness is a priority, which gives parents peace of mind as their children explore and play. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure everyone has a good experience while keeping the environment safe.

There are seating areas for parents, and they offer beverages to purchase, so you can relax while your kids burn off some energy.

Overall, Kid Zone is a fantastic place for kids to run, and play in a controlled and fun environment. It’s a great option for birthday parties or just to get out of the house on a rainy day. Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the Powell area!

Review: Great concept! But unfortunately, it was not very clean. I wish I had read reviews before going because I now see quite a few others saying the same. There was trash in and around the play area and we were the first and only ones there so I know the trash had been there a while. The play area itself was cool, but not really for my 3 year old. He was not tall enough to climb some of the structures on his own and I was uncomfortable putting my 7 month old on the floor to help him with it being so dirty. The 3 and under area would have been great but a lot of the toys were broken and, again, just very dirty. We may come back when my kids are older, but honestly I’m not even sure about that. I can overlook a lot of things but the overall dirtiness of the entire place was frustrating. Especially since kids are climbing and crawling around. My 3 year olds socks were black on bottom when we left from how dirty it was. Unacceptable.

Review: Very cool little town area. It’s just a great concept in general. However, I will say the entire place was dirty. Stuff was under the picnic tables, clearly wasn’t slept from the night before. The play centers needed wiping down and for context, we were the FIRST ones in there when it opened. The obnoxious kidz bop was blaring at 9 am. It was freezing, at 67 degrees on the thermostat. Inside the climbing area needed to be wiped down as well. The farm animals could use a power wash, so could the mats surrounding the gym equipment. Random socks under the equipment. The wooden play screw washers for the table in the little town are huge choking hazards for 3 and under, surprisingly in the 3 and under section. If a place isn’t being cleaned down, it’s not being sanitized and kids places need sanitizing. Again, cool place, just needs improvement.

Review: It isn’t the worst place but definitely not for kids 3-12 more like 1-3. The pictures you guys have online are similar to how it looks but DEFINITELY not how it is in person.. definitely not what I expected. 3 levels of excitement are exaggerating. The building itself is pretty big but the space in the kid zone like on the pictures is false advertising. My son is 7 and literally had to squat down to walk around. Would recommend for toddlers but definitely not anything older than that.

Review: It's a nice way for my child to get exercise since it's still too cold for the outdoor playground. The place is nice enough and my child has a fun time. It's overpriced in my opinion unless you get a membership.

The only irritating part about it is that there is a little boy whose mom works behind the counter, and he can be problematic sometimes. God knows that little kids can be difficult enough without having to man the front desk while trying to keep an eye on them. That being said, my kid has been attacked by this little boy several times since we started going there and will come home with scratch marks and red skin. He also causes issues with other customers' children as well - taking their toys and being disruptive/loud.

This won't stop us from coming back indefinitely, but just something to keep in mind if you have smaller children. I won't let them play together unless I'm able to sit right next to my kid to make sure he's not being hurt.

Review: Friendly staff and a great area for kids to play freely. I went for a birthday party and the kids were busy with the play structures and the 4 play house rooms. They really kept the kids so busy parents were able to talk and relax. The play house rooms (barn, kitchen, store, garage) could fit 3 or 4 kids each and provide room for imagination to take over. The play structure had 2 or 3 levels with slides of multiple heights, the kids enjoyed the slides with 4 side by side and raced down to the bottom only to get back in line and challenge another group. Great experience and just off Clinton highway make the location convenient.

Review: Today was the first day my son and I visited Kid Zone. We LOVED it! We heard from others in local community how awesome it is (especially for 3 year olds). This is a place we have been needing for a while in our area. I am not sure what Rebecca Sweet from WBIR is referring to in her review about Kid Zone, (from her other reviews and how she interacts with others, it appears she is hard to please 🙄), but when we went the area was nice, clean, and worth every minute of it. So, unless you want your children playing in a bubble and not be kids, I recommend this place (as a realistic mom)! We will be back and thank you! I didn’t take many pics because we were having too much fun! 😄

The heater was also going on full blast and our kids were complaining about how hot it was…the adults thought it was really warm too. Hate to say but we probably won’t go back.

Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me. Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially a mom that needs to get out and socialize. Food is delicious!

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Review: I held my daughters 3rd birthday here today. Me and my family have been here one other time, and were completely SOLD. Today just sealed the deal! Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: I’ve visited many indoor playgrounds, but Kids Jungle World is one of my favorites! It's exceptionally clean and has a calm, welcoming atmosphere. It's a perfect place for toddlers to play, especially when the weather isn’t great outside. The colorful theme and variety of rides make it fun for both little ones and older kids. Everyone can enjoy at their own pace. I really like this place!

Review: We visited Kidz Jungle World on Christmas Eve, and it was an absolute delight! Despite being a busy holiday, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better. The play equipment was impressively clean, showing the care and effort put into maintaining the facility.

One of the standout features for us was the high weight limit on the equipment, allowing parents to join in the fun without worry. It’s also fantastic that parents enter for free – a thoughtful touch that sets this soft play centre apart from others.

The entrance fee being a whole-day pass is excellent value, and we appreciated the flexibility it gave us. Our two-year-old absolutely loved exploring all the different areas, and we would have stayed even longer if we didn’t have other commitments.

Overall, we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend Kidz Jungle World to anyone looking for a fun, family-friendly outing. It’s a perfect spot for kids to play, laugh, and burn off energy while parents can relax or join in. A solid 5/5 experience!

On the day of her party the staff made sure everything went smoothly. Leading up the party, I received a call to ensure I understood everything and to help with anything else I needed. I’m thankful for their care of their customers and making accommodations even at the last minute. The kids had fun and so did the adults!

Review: Balls are extremely DIRTY!!! Black dirt all over most of the balls in the ball pit! They do not clean them at all, but they charge the same price as places that clean their balls. Don’t let your kids play at this place until they CLEAN their ball pit!!!! So upset that this is a kids facility and they have a ball pit that looks neglected.

Review: I've been coming to Jungle Kids world since it opened. The customer service has been consistently kind, helpful, and quick (at reception). Over the past two years the gun machine have never been working when we go. Now the machine that makes the balls pop up doesn't work. And the tube that sucks up balls also doesn't work and so that means the area where the balls collect cannot be used to make all the balls fall down. The tree swing was gone and the metal Zipline that my son lives was also broken. The floors felt sticky. I feel like this place is on the decline. I hope they get it together. It's very disappointing. We come here often because it's close to my house and the kids love it. In fairness they did still have a good time. So one star for customer service and one for the kids having a good time.

Review: Highly recommend. My almost 3 year old had a fantastic time and after 1.5 hour’s he is worn out and satisfied. They had so many obstacles and my son didn’t want to leave. Take your child here if you want to tire him/her out.

One of the things that stood out was the front desk employee Arnetia. You can tell she genuinely loves her job! I observed her and she treated everyone with such kindness. We came near closing time and not once did we feel rushed to leave. The entire time she kept busy mopping and cleaning (which by the way as soon as you walk in you can smell the cleanliness of the place). When she wasn’t cleaning she was happily engaging with the children making sure they were safe. It’s rare that I meet someone with such a gentle and sunny disposition. Arnetia is the kind of employee you want representing your company. I hope someone in corporate reads this. Keep hiring employees like her and you’ll stay in business for years to come.

I have held two birthday parties at this location within the past 2 years and both experiences were excellent. The staff has timely communications, is very friendly and is very attentive even to last-minute changes. The birthday packages are flexible and very reasonably priced. I had a birthday party for my son here last weekend and everyone had a wonderful time including the parents because there are plenty of places for parents to hang out. Fun, cleanliness and affordability check check check!! Thank you so much Kidz Jungle World I really appreciate you!!

The water in the trampoline that’s in the tiny kids corner is filthy . It looks green & def not sanitary . The guns over in the ball pit don’t work . And once bigger kids start coming , it gets really hectic cause the workers don’t really pay attention to what’s going on. My kids almost got trampled on a few times from teenagers rough housing .

Review: What a fantastic experience. The kids had a blast for over 2 and a half hours and there was a variety of things for all ages to do (18 months - 8 years in our group). The woman working was phenomenal in making sure the environment was clean and safe and went above and beyond in showing me a easy way to the slide for me and the littlest one to slide down together without having to climb through the whole structure. Additionally, she went out of her way to show the kids how to fill the foam ball blower so that the balls cascaded everywhere to the delight of the children. The largest play structure has a variety of passages, but all of the entrances and exits are condensed toward the front for easy viewing from the two smaller play areas where parents would accompany younger children allowing them to also keep and eye on their older ones. We can't wait to go again in the future!

Review: My baby had her first birthday party today and she loved it. All the kids that came to help celebrate her birthday enjoyed themselves. The kids didn’t want to leave, imma definitely bring my baby back for just a regular day of fun especially since she’ll be walking alot better on her own. I’ve nevet heard of this place before finding it on Google for a place for toddlers to have fun and I’m glad I found it. The employees kept checking to make sure we were good and had everything we needed. Thank you for making my baby first birthday a special one!!!

Review: I went into this play park on Easter and the four ladies that were running the Easter celebration did a phenomenal job. They really need an applause for the work they did. They kept the children entertained, we had dance parties, the kids showed the bunny their dance moves and we even had a little dancing with the adults doing the Cupid shuffle with the bunny. The employees made it fun for everyone including the adults. We were all running around trying to find golden eggs with the kids and it was just a time. Please let your employees know what an amazing job they did. 10/10 experience, even on a regular day the employees are always amazing and do their jobs accordingly and in a timely manner.

Review: We have been regulars at Totsville for some time now and it is a great place to take the kids! The price is cost effective and you get your money’s worth with the amount of time you can spend and the experience for your little ones. The place is clean and often workers are walking around vacuuming which is nice to see! The sand pit is a super plus and keeps the children entertained for hours. The play structure is also engaging and inviting for the children. There is a separate space for younger children which is nice to have for the little ones. It is never overly crowded and is the perfect way to engage in play!

Review: I frequently visit that place and have never had any problems, but the cashier did a terrible job. I don't want to think it's because of my Hispanic race, but I didn't receive the same treatment as other people. I recommend the place, however, she is very rude. You can check her cameras if you want, she knows it.

Review: My 2.5-year-old loved it. It was large enough for him to navigate independently while remaining visible to me during play. Like most play gyms, it smells like a gym, and the bathrooms weren’t as inviting as they could have been. However, overall, the play fixtures and sandbox were a hit with my little one. We’ll be back.

Review: Clean, tidy, and friendly staff! Everyone was in such good spirits. I thought my toddler might be too wild for an indoor playground, nope we fit right in!

Apparently I was wrong I am amending my previous review. Upon our most recent visit, there is now the playground police at Totsville. ""Don't touch this, don't touch that."" If you don't want children touching something maybe don't put it at an indoor playground. An employee grabbed a toy from my toddler but did absolutely nothing when another larger child hit my 18 month old. I don't think we will be returning, no matter how clean the facility is.

They ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT !!! and, they are all STILL talking about the FUN TIMES they had that day !  It rained that morning ... An outside party would've been a disaster. No worries being inside, as I watched it raining ! The Staff made sure everyone was having a great time, too ! Megan and Elvin explained everything so well to me, when the arrangements were being made - answering all 100 questions I had ! An A+ to everybody at TotsVille ! ⭐👍🥇

It was so refreshing because you have so many adults fast to approach a child and he didn't, he approached the parent as needed and was very sweet about it. I seen another young lady vacuuming keeping the area clean for the little ones. It was really fun and we didn't want to leave. We will definitely be back💗💖 Thank you totsville.

Review: Kiddo loved the big sandbox and all the toys in it! She's 2, so particularly I liked the *idea* of the area by just for smaller kiddos. But the one downside was there was no real enforcement of that, so as the morning went on and more kiddos showed up, there was a group of bigger kids sprinting around, including in that area, as I saw more than one kid (including her) get knocked down by them not paying attention (and unfortunately their grownups didn't seem to be paying much attention, either, to helping direct them to better areas to run around/reminding them to be careful of others).

Review: We really enjoyed this place. I have an almost 2 year old who loves to climb and let loose. I liked this place because it’s built for kids under 8 only. Its climbing areas are only 1 story tall so it’s easy to spot your child from the ground. They have great slides, ball pits, a giant sandbox and some really cool tubes. One thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness. The floor was spotless. The staff were courteous, there was even a coffee machine, not that we used it. They also had an area where they can climb a wall, build blocks, etc. It was crowded but not so much that he couldn’t enjoy himself and I didn’t lose track of him. They also had a bubble machine which was kind of cool to see go off every once in a while. I think we would definitely go back to this place.

One of the employees notice me and my family waiting in a long bathroom line and offered to lead us to the extra bathroom downstairs. Above and beyond!

Review: Save yourself the time and disgust and keep your children away from Totsville Indoor Playground in Glen Burnie. The entire place completely reeks of urine and you can literally feel the moisture from the grimey carpet on your feet. The equipment was broken and obviously dirty. $30 and we only lasted 20 minutes due to the smell and overall condition of the place. Today was the first time I went in years and it will definitely be my last.

They also had snacks available for purchase. We stayed for about two hours towards the end of the day and it was not busy at all at one point we had the whole place to ourselves.

Review: It has been 5 years since I visited this business. I still feel uncomfortable driving past it.

When my rule-oriented, 47 pound, 8 year old Autistic child, pointed out that they were over legal capacity, they had a strong reaction.

I get it. The economy was cruddy and pandemic drama was stressful.

That did not justify an employee (who was also part owner) getting down in my child's face to say something like, 'How's it gonna feel to be the kid whose Mommy got kicked out of the Playground because you were harassing us??!!""

My elementary age child was not harassing anyone. He said, ""Excuse me, you might want to know that there are too many people in the climber and nobody is wearing their masks.""

Considering that they had laws about capacity and masking posted in the entryway, his comment was logical.

Small businesses really took a hit in 2020. The pressure was intense. That still doesn't justify the amount of unbridled rage that was directed at my family...particularly at young kids.

If there had been an apology or even a truce in the last few years, I wouldn't be writing this.

But instead, when I left a review on FB (back when it actually happened) I got messaged with more anger and accusation, saying I must want their business to fail.

That wasn't my goal. I'm not spiteful.

My goal was to raise awareness about their customer service so they could improve.

Maybe they did. I wouldn't know, because they scared my kids so badly that they have never wanted to go back.

We are looking forward to Midland Mall opening it's Playland. My youngest will still be young enough to enjoy it.

Because I Googled it, Google suggested I leave a review about this place. So.... I am sharing my experience.

It's not current and it may have nothing to do, with how they run things now. But I believe that we should be accountable for our choices, and I would still like to hear an apology for yelling in my child's face. Because that's just not good customer service.. and kids deserve to feel SAFE, in spaces that advertise themselves as child oriented.

My littles stay busy here for hours and the cafe makes it so easy to replenish on snacks/drinks. And they offer gluten free snacks and sandwiches which is a huge win for our celiac family. From hair ties and diapers in the bathroom to wifi, this place is so accommodating. Feels like you’re visiting your besties house.

Review: I love the concept but struggled with the lack of supervision. The play area was clean and regularly wiped down in the hour we were there. They had a cute little cafe with snacks and drinks and tables to sit at when the kids were ready for a break. My 7 year old loved the big play area and I was able to watch her while in the toddler area with my 1.5 year old.
Unfortunately there were big kids in and out of the toddler and baby area. They were throwing toys and hitting each other with them. Climbing and jumping off from the toddler play structure and walls into the baby area. Several parents were switching their baby/toddler into the other section to avoid the roughhousing when it became unsafe but unfortunately it was happening in both sections and it was multiple children. I was 8.5 months pregnant and ended up leaving after a child climbed on top of a table and jumped over the gate, almost kicking me in the face in the process as I helped my toddler climb up the steps on the boat.

Review: We've been in the playground on multiple occasions the past year since we moved in the area.
The few times we have been treated well with friendly customer service.
But the past few times have been rude.
There is a lady that's been working the past few times I believe her name is Kelly!
The first time I just thought ""oh maybe she's having a bad day or she's just really busy 🤔. So I just let it be.
So the next time we came in she was working, I noticed she is friendly to certain people, she told two other mothers that left thanks for coming have a great rest of your day!
As she walked past us to take something to a side room I smiled at her acknowledge her, she looked the other way. Ok whatever, but as we was putting our shoes and coat on, as she seen us we was the only people in there at this time and she said nothing no thanks no see ya nothing!!
So Ok whatever again, we'll the next time we was in there,  I heard her talking loud to another gal working with her, she was complaining about another worker that did not do what she was told to do in the party room something about cleaning it!!
That's just unprofessional to me.
She acts like a CEO but very unprofessionaly way!

I am always friendly 🙂 smiles when I come in there with my Son. We follow all the rules, I am unsure why she acts like that. She is plan rude 😤

Review: We had fun, it was clean, and not expensive. Though it seemed like some kids were unattended. I understand this is no fault of the workers, as the parents are supposed to be watching them. But I didn’t love that. I had to tell a worker that something was happening with a child being hurtful to another child (literally picking up the kid and throwing them on the floor and then spinning them around like crazy/ this was a 6 ish yr old doing it to a maybe one year old). The staff did talk to the child, but where was the parent?May need better rules in place to avoid things like that happening. Otherwise, my kiddo had fun.

Review: This is a wonderful concept. To have separate areas for babies, toddlers and big kids. I brought a toddler here today but I will NOT be back. There is NO kind of monitoring AT ALL to keep the big kids out of the toddler and baby areas. We came during a birthday party and the big kids were running wild! Climbing over the walls into the baby and toddler areas and hitting each other with the toys in the toddler area.  Several parents just stood around and watched! I was appalled! I went to the concession stand and told the girls up there what was happening. Which they could already see! I said doesn’t anyone monitor anything that is going on here? She said I’ll go over there after I take your order. No urgency at all to take care of the situation. I have been to a LOT of play areas from Michigan to Florida and multiple places in between, but have NEVER witnessed behavior and the lackadaisical attitude I saw here today!!!

Review: My husband and I took our 2 1/2 and 10 month old here. Upon entering we were very excited for the separation of ages. At the counter the staff even mentioned how are 2 1/2 year old really shouldn't be in with the babies. Walking through the playground, we enjoyed all the fun activities to do. However, there was a birthday party and the older kids were everywhere. In the baby area, toddler and on the big set. My husband and I couldn't even set our baby down to play because the older kids were not paying attention. They were sockless (ewww), taking toys from the baby and toddler areas and putting them other places, and their parents were not stopping them. My husband complained to the staff, who ultimately didn't care. They were on their phones... we left after 30 minutes of trying to play. I will never go back due to staff not being helpful and not feeling safe to let our kids play.

Review: It's a fun little place for kids. There are two seperate secure sections so little ones can play (one section for up to 18 months and the other for under 3 years).  There is an area you can get food and drinks. Unfortunately the Hot Caramel Latte I ordered tasted burnt and bitter. There were two attendants and one was courteous while the other.....well......... I think she was having an off day, but she still did her job. it was a steady flow of traffic while my kids were here, but it was not packed at that time. All in all, the play area itself is good for your kids to let out some energy in a safe manner while the supervising adults can enjoy some coffe and; let's be honest, a little break! This is just my experience so don't hesitate to bring your kids here to play, and for only $8 for kids up to 13 years old, along with reasonable prices on drinks and food,  it's definitely worth it to check this place out! I will say this: have sanitizer on hand bc just like other play places, sanitation practices may be much to be desired!

Review: My wife and I went here with our two kids (5 y/o and 21 months) and found it to be OK. On a cold and rainy day, it provides a place to take the kids to burn off some energy.

The issues we had with it relate to staffing and cleanliness. On the cleanliness perspective, the is NO area for mouthed toys so they can be properly cleaned and sanitized. Kids were placing the plastic toy balls from what would be a ball pit in their mouths and dropping them, and moving on. There MUST be a place that these items can be placed so they can be cleaned to limit the transmission of Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease and other common childhood illnesses.

Staffing: On the day we went, the wide majority of the staff were only a few years older than some of the kids actually playing on the playground. Since, in Michigan, minors can be 14 and work, my suspicion is that most were around that age and they mostly tended to the snack bar. The Playground has two separate areas where kids under 18 months and under 3 years could play (bravo- excellent idea), except those areas often had children outside of those age brackets and the ""staff"" would be best utilized by supervising these areas to any degree for safety purposes. I stopped this when I saw it, but not all parents show the same courtesy, so this would be a great use of the staff.

For two children, we paid $16 on a weekday and were there for about 60-75 minutes. There is a snack bar with a variety of items you'd find in a Meijer (Frito-Lay brand potato chips, Kraft cheese sticks, pizza, juice boxes) and a selection of coffee drinks.

With some changes to their cleaning protocol and staff practices, we would consider returning. 3 out of 5 stars as the review implies: average.

Review: Visited with a 4 year old and 7 year old. We stayed for 3 hours. My 7 year old said he gives this place 30 stars. Kids had a blast! I witnessed staff cleaning throughout our visit in the play areas. The facility was clean and in good working condition. We ate pizza and it was surprisingly really good for not being a pizza place. It was definitely worth the 16 dollars to get in and we will be back.

Review: Don't waste your time booking a party.  We scheduled a birthday party at this outrageously expensive location and not only were we paying $430 for the party and food but we were told at the door that we couldn't have our cake and ice cream we had to choose one of the other. We obviously chose the birthday cake for our kids party and they said they would hang on to the ice cream until we left. We forgot and they never mentioned to grab the ice cream so I immediately called them once I got home that night and they didn't answer their phones of course don't have voicemails so I can't leave them a message. I messaged them on Facebook which they say is the most reliable way to contact them and they never bother sending me a message back I go in 11 days after my party and they let me know that they threw away my $25 worth ice cream that was brand new in the packaging because ""everybody else leaves her ice cream here and they don't have room to store it"". If they would have reply to the message I sent or answered my phone call they could have let me know on either one of those that after a week they throw the ice cream away even though it's brand new in the package never been opened. I'll be selling my gift card I was gifted because I I'll be selling my gift card I was gifted because I refuse to waste my time or energy with this place anymore. They don't deserve the business. Oh and just to add if you do have a party here and you run 10 minutes over they charge you $100 for every 10 minutes over you are past your time. It's in the contract in the small print

Review: I just had a party for my 4 year old this past Saturday April 26th. The fact my son loves this place and enjoys playing time is why I chose this location. The party experience was horrible! When I first arrived , I was told I was not booked for a party, first mistake. My party room wasn’t available at the start time. It took over 40 minutes to get pizza. When it finally arrived it was burned! The staff wasn’t in the room, no water in the room which was included in my packages. I had to go ask the staff for water! I ordered French fries which was an additional cost! Staff stated it would take over 30 mins due to the fryer being broke! Overall experience was awful, On top of me never receiving my fries after paying. The money spent was not worth it at all. Literally what did I pay for??? A refund and or discount is what I expect to get. The list goes on! Corporate will definitely hear from me. Poor staff, unprofessional, just a mess! Highly disappointed!

Review: I’ve been coming to Billy Beez regularly with my kids and fiancé, and we’ve never had any issues until today. My family and I visited, and from the start, the staff, especially the manager Elijah, were extremely rude and unprofessional.

Elijah forced my mother to pay for socks, even though her kids already had socks on. However, minutes later, another family walked in, and he let them in without paying, saying they “come here all the time  and already had Billy Beez socks even though they weren’t even wearing them. This was clearly unfair treatment, and when my mother called him out for it, he got defensive instead of addressing the real issue.

Instead of handling the situation professionally, Elijah chose to escalate things by calling the police. Thankfully, the officer was polite and didn’t make the situation worse, but it should never have come to that.

None of the employees were friendly, and instead of creating a welcoming environment, they seemed irritated to even be there. While the play area itself is great for kids, the poor customer service makes it hard to enjoy the experience. I won’t be returning, and I wouldn’t recommend this location to others until they train their staff to be more professional and treat all customers fairly.

The food ordered didn’t come out properly.  We ordered 4 pizza and chicken strips (I feed parents and children).  2 pizza came out 30 minutes after the start if the party, 2 more pizza came out another 30 mins, and chicken strips came out 15 minutes before the 2 hours was over.  I requested to food to come out right away so we don’t have to go search the kids in that huge place.  It was more stressful for me than doing it at home.  I complain and hear nothing from the cooperates.  This is how bad it operates.

Review: When my daughter was taking horseback lessons in Manassas a year ago, billy beez was a regular stop for us afterwards maybe once a month.   Many play places max out for kids at about age 8.  And then I feel like there's a gap before a child can have fun at like a dave n buster's.  I appreciate that billy beez fills that gap plus provides safe spaces for toddlers.  If you have kids who are 7 to 12 and still wanting a play place this is the spot.  I also appreciate no time limits whereas many places limit to 90 minutes or 2 hours.  Yes I have been there when the slushy machine wasnt working but like most play places it's a mad house so in my opinion it happens.  I did not experience any of my children becoming sick nor did I witness lack of cleanliness other than customers not cleaning their tables.  However,  I don't blame the establishment for that.  As a parent I also greatly appreciate the security.  Your child cannot accidentally run out.  Everyone who exits is checked for matching bands.  I can sit down and my kids can have fun.

Review: First time visiting for me. Lots of structures and activities for children. But, there are lots of dark and shadowy areas. There is an arcade area! However, the credit dispenser doesn't work, and the staff can not fix it. You'll have to go to the front desk to replenish your card.  Kids seem to like this place. The price of admission includes all-day access, that's nice.  Slightly, unprofessional, sagging pants and revealing underwear to a little attitude and show of annoyance by staffers.

Review: I’m truly unsure how this place is still open, the filth, the overpriced admission, the food, the restrooms, and the broken/out of service games/play areas is ridiculous. My daughter turned up sick almost immediately after we left, and was sick for about a week. The tunnels/slide area smelled of someone maybe having used the bathroom in it. The food was very under par, I assume hospital food is better and healthier. The filth of the overall areas that you would expect to be clean and sanitized was clear, dining tables dirty, fingerprints/handprints on nearly all clear surfaces, toys that should have been thrown away a long time ago, I mean it is DIRTY. On top of being dirty, the employees are rude. They need to do a re-haul of this place and the employees because if not in the future it will definitely be closed down. I know they probably have so many inspection violations and there is just no way at all they have staff who clean, furthermore I would love to see how the interviews go, its almost like they ask can you maintain a bad attitude every day and if the person answers yes they will be hired. Dirty, unprofessional , not worth the money.

Review: My last time visiting before yesterday with (1) 3 year old was last year. Before yesterday she had not been sick since last year from daycare. But lo and behold she had an excessive runny nose  ( not allergy related) , and I got diagnosed with pink eye as soon as I woke up in the morning and went to urgent care. This is ridiculous. They charge SO much for admission… I could completely understand if it’s to cover maintenance and cleaning, but WHAT cleaning. This place is a Petri dish. Also, might I add I was NOT even with my child on any of the playground equipment. My older teenager was and she had gotten over something viral 3 weeks prior. You do the Math. Also, the staff act as nasty as this place is. So if you have a very little child that you can take to the pretend wooden area and can closely make sure they don’t put fingers in he mouth or on face and can actively sanitize in between. Then, it’s probably not worth it.

Review: Last week, we hosted our daughter's birthday party at Billy Beez in Manassas. From the start, a woman who seemed to be the party manager greeted us with an unfriendly expression, which left our guests feeling uncomfortable right away.

After seeing the previous party use a cart for their belongings, I asked the party manager if we could use one as well since we had a lot of items to carry. She firmly said no. I accepted this without issue, but later asked another staff member who said it was fine to use the cart. This inconsistency made me increasingly frustrated with the party manager, but we proceeded with the party for the sake of our daughter.

After the party, our guests commented on how it seemed there was no host from Billy Beez, and that we appeared to be handling everything ourselves, which looked exhausting. We discovered that our reservation included host services, but we did not receive any of the benefits. We had to call the children, serve the birthday cake and pizza ourselves, and we were unable to take any pictures. Additionally, we initially ordered a combo that included two pizzas and two pitchers of drinks, but the drinks did not arrive and we had to pay separately for them later on.

We were very disappointed with the poor service. If Billy Beez typically does not provide a host and only sets up the room, they should remove the host support option from their plans. Although there was one somewhat friendly male manager, the overall experience was so negative that we cannot write a positive review.

For the price we paid, it would have been better to host the party at a nearby Sky Zone or Chuck E. Cheese. We initially debated between those three options, but now we regret our choice.

Review: Update — just came back again after a very long time only because my kids were asking so many times to come here. Came to find out all staff had changed, new staff are all very helpful and super friendly! The manager was also very kind. They gave us the socks which we never received before. They treated us very well. I am very happy to see the positive changes here. We bought the 10 pass package. Would live to come here often now since it’s my kids’ favorite playground.

Rude staff, the staff treated us like we are the prisoners, when I left my kids to my husband inside and tried to run for an errand, the staff interrogated me asking who is watching the kids and where my husband is. The staff could’ve asked nicely and I would’ve answered nicely and would’ve understood why they question, but the way the staff questioned me like I was being interrogated like I was trying to escape from prison lol. When I came back and my husband wanted to leave for awhile, the staff did not allow my husband to leave even tho he told the staff that I was watching the kids. When he came back the staff threatened my husband that they would call the police lmao, for what?! And they did not let my husband to get back in until I stepped in their arguments. I felt like we were in prison or something, hack of an experience. I was very angry and frustrated, I hated that my kids had to witness the arguments between us and the staff. It was supposed to be a happy experience for my kids. My kids love playing there that’s the only reason I gave 2 stars, I would give 0 star otherwise. This is the second time we were not happy about the way the staff treated us there.

Review: as a out of towner just was visiting and gave three stars wasn't my best experience for me and my child .. customer service could have been a little better but I understand they are teens or young adults so I didn't really pay it no mind .. bathroom was extremely dirty ..
its a large place however there should be a little more supervision when it comes to staff older kids shouldn't be playing in the baby / toddler area in my opinion it was like a zoo kids was all over the place

Review: Pros:
- kids had fun (4 7-year-old girls)
- they no longer charge extra for the Honeycomb Village or the trampolines
- at $17/kid and $6/adult, it’s cheaper or equivalent to taking your kids to another indoor play place, like SkyZone

Cons:
- you have to buy their socks even if you come wearing the same kind of socks you get from SkyZone/Defy/etc. I’ve never been told we have to purchase THEIR socks at a place when I came already wearing the socks with the rubber bits on the bottoms.
- the bathroom was incredibly dirty: no seat covers, no soap, toilet paper and bloody bandaids on the floor. And this was first thing in the morning! Gross.
- the front desk person didn’t call for backup to get people in faster until 11 am, so we stood in line from 10-10:30. There were about 10 people in front of us.
- the concession counter has very few options (chips, soft pretzels, and Gatorade), the menu screen doesn’t work so you can’t see prices, and the machines were broken.
- it’s easy to lose track of your kids, and for them to lose you. I saw many sad, crying, lost children.
- no employee supervision anywhere.
- first adult cost $5.95, but next one cost $6.95? Why?

Bottom line: I won’t be back for a while. There were a lot of little kids (less than 5 years old) at 10 am on a Saturday, and that’s great to know so I can maybe take my youngest child one day. I’ve been there before when there were many 13+ year old kids and that was scary to me, sending my little kids into the depths of these tunnels with such older kids running around. 😬 Kids are considered up to age 17 and adults are encouraged to climb around in the tunnels, too.
I was mostly disappointed by the argument over us having to buy THEIR socks, and how disgusting the bathroom was.

There was a line of people outside and employees didn’t show up until 10:30am. They didn’t say a word to any customers, apologize or offer us a discount or free admission. It’s the last time we will visit. The employees literally do not care.

Review: The staff are rude and disrespectful, below 2 experience I had with them:
- I asked the staff who was checking me in what was the photo and video policy before I signed the waiver; she almost put her phone into my face explaining that no one would videotape like this. And I replied that on one does that. She could have politely explained that the policy was not to blame or sue them if my kid gets recorded in other people’s phones.
- Another front desk staff I asked where should I exit, cause the exit door was not working, she just said here and didn’t open the door until she did some other work while I’m carrying my baby who was sleepy and tired, and when I tried to open the door myself, she literally shouted “Stop”, and I couldn’t respond in the same disrespectful way cause I didn’t want my baby see me being impolite towards other people, but at the same time it frustrated me hence why I decided to write this comment.

I highly recommend an enhanced professional training in communication and behavior for the team, particularly when interacting with children and parents.

Review: Its a great place for kids to play, they had so many courses and the arcade games were fun. Some of the staff were friendly but some were not. I had booked a party there and nearly spent $1000 altogether and i will never do it again. My first problem, when i came in they had the incorrect amount of kids that i had added 2 days before the party but thankfully the manager was nice enough to fix it. My party hostess was also nice but was not attenive at all. I only saw her 3 times throughout the duration of the party and when i needed utensils and etc i had to go to the kitchen to ask. Some of my guest never received their game card. The birthday boy never recieved his birthday shirt. The food is overpriced and bad quality. If you want to come here for a good time thats fine but i definitely don't recommend throwing a birthday party here. Birthdays are supposed to be special and i definitely did not get that experience here.

Review: This is a nice place to take kids to get some energy out. I appreciate that the equipment is large enough so that parents can play with the kids. The slides are huge and fun. It seems pretty clean, about as clean as a kids playground is going to be.
My son always has loads of fun here and I like that there are 6 different play areas; one with a trampoline, one with video games, a 3 and younger spot, one with little buildings, and the large play area with slides.
My son always has a lot of fun here!
I think maybe they could mop the floors a bit more often and wipe down the benches in the play areas, that would make me feel more comfortable here. Also, the massage chairs are nice but there should definitely be some disinfectant wipes available to wipe them down before/after use.

There was food crushed up on the floor, clogged toilets, no toilet paper or paper towels, dirt throughout the play equipment as well as build up of dust. The guy at the front taking payment just sat on his phone the whole time. I think management needs to get involved before it goes anymore downhill.

Review: The place is amazing. We had a birthday party with about 10+ kids and they all had a blast. The place looks clean as well. The only downside for our experience is the customer service. From the moment we got there, the front desk people weren't very friendly or inviting. They made an announcement for our birthday cake 30 mins before our time was up and then proceeded to push us out of our room. Not a big problem as we were aware when our time ends--it would have been nice to have more time to eat the cake and other snacks.

The place was nice but the experience was overall lacking.

Review: Recently Hosted my daughter Birthday Party here…
Originally party time was 3:30
We arrived at 3:25. I didn’t know we had to arrived early to sign a waiver and sign paperwork. Which took over 15 minutes.
When I signed in at the front with the birthday party coordinator. I asked if I could removed 2 extra pizza combos.(2 pizza 2 pitchers soda) since I had a few people canceling over the night before the birthday party due sickness.
The guy said “it’s no possible because it’s already in the system.”
So I had to pay $86.00 on extra food even when I requested them to canceled.
FOOD is not that good. 1 of our pizzas was almost burned and other ones were not even fully cooked.
They only brought 6 pitchers of soda instead of 8.
Pitchers had more ice than actual soda so I had to request soda only for the next time.
They didn’t even have a knife to cut the cake and obviously won’t let you bring one.
Most of my guests said that service was bad.
The kids had a great time playing and they have fun.
I don’t recommend hosting a party here.

Review: It’s ok… deff not suitable for younger kids. Came here to just try it out because my kiddo loves totsville. He did enjoy some of the play structures but my 4 stars is mainly for cleanliness and the overall look of the facility. It appeared to be very dirty especially the play mats and some of the structures just look very unclean. There were also a lot of things like the ball guns that just didn’t work at all, or caution tape around things, it just didn’t look very presentable. When my kiddo is older I’d deff prob come back just not on the weekend. Pretty packed and most don’t watch their children leaving them to knock down or throw things at younger kids. We will stick to totsville for now

Review: If you haven’t been in a while, don’t go expecting what it was a few years ago. More than half of the equipment was broken, or gone. There are holes in the climbing, making it unsafe - as kids can climb on top of the structures. Caution taped off areas all over. There was also cleaning supplies left out in the climbing structures. I watch my kid - but for others, that could be detrimental. I wouldn’t recommend this place at ALL.

Review: I would NOT recommend location birthday parties only for kids to enjoy the playground and have fun but outside of that , our party Experience was an ABSOLUTE Nightmare. Unfortunately, today we were unable to enjoy our party with constantly being followed around by the new host to the point where she climbed up on a playground to deliver the bill mid party. There was no organization or Communication!,  to be honest We would’ve operated better without a host. it was more like being policed & rushed out the room.
And as for the  manager Yaya whom Completely lacks customer service to start with she wasn’t allowing Guest due to the fact that we paid before their arrival, we wasnt not notified  about our guest & took 5minutes for her to understand that we’re willing to pay for the xtra children, and unfortunately, she’s telling my guess it’s a $21 fee perchild yet told me right in front of them that it was a $17 fee.  the way miss yaya sat outside the party room staring through the window at 7:10 pushing for is to leave At 7:15 is when we was suppose to clean up. Remind you where the last party of the day at that point, the only party of there. We basically got treated like we were unwanted and thieves for having a birthday party. I didn’t get the assitant managers name, but she has been nothing but outstanding customer service and understanding should be the main one managing!!
I really wish I would’ve took pictures, but I was trying to enjoy my child party & like i said I would  recommend location birthday parties unless you want completely surcharged for lack of Communication & a headache.

Some of Kidzville’s clientele is unsavory, and you need strong, armed men there to deter and address dangerous behavior. Please beef up the security presence again, or my family will not feel safe spending time at Kidzville anymore.

Adults have to wear socks too, so if you’re throwing a party have the forethought to put that on the invite. They got a little too excited about making me buy socks when I was only wearing sandals. Seems a little scammy and overpriced. Lots of better options for a birthday party in the area. Would not recommend.

Review: Nice place for kids to blow off energy!! There was a one lady there who was awesome and very professional. I do not want to mention race. However, as an employee, she stood out. She was the only one to greet us too
The bumper car ride is outrageously price 5mins 7 dollars. The cost to get in was almost thirty dollars just for my son and I.... talking about inflation.

Review: A fun facility with varied activities, but their policy of allowing massive camp groups in during the summer weekdays can swamp the facility for other kids. They should limit group sizes. Parents of kids looking for a fun indoor activity during a summer weekday - be well forewarned of this issue.

Review: July 2024 - Still clean. Still excellent. Security is vigilant, caring and awesome. Staff are friendly. Still my favorite place ✅

June 2023 - Positive update. It was closing time and we were the only people there getting ready to leave. Several employees came out to clean, spray and wipe down the areas of this massive playground. Highly impressed with everyone here.

actively engaged in watching and helping kids. They are constantly cleaning and the place is massive, so much to do from the many obstacle courses to bikes to bumper cars, imaginative play, ball pits, foam pits, slides everywhere. I didn't come expecting to play but I'm an adult and I had a ball. We can't wait to come back. There's also food. We stayed here for hours. Our favorite bounce place now hands down.

Review: Overall, the actual facility was fine, but I booked a party for 18. I was coming from out of town and arrived at 1:45 PM. The party was going to start at 2 PM. The room was empty so I asked if I could put this large sheet cake I was carrying in the room on the table. I was told no! I even indicated the room was empty. I just wanted to set this cake down and I would leave the room. I was told no. I brought a four year-old with me who wanted to start playing, 10 minutes early and they told me I had to pay an extra 21.99.  I stated that I had a party which they knew for $575 so couldn't they let my four year-old jump 10 minutes early. They said no. The rudest of the staff was a kid named Ben. He looked like he was about 12, but I assume he was 16. If my boys ever spoke to me the way this boy spoke to me they would've been grounded for life. I could give many examples but I won't. I will say the party was to end at 3:45 PM which I was fully aware and plan to be out of the room by then because I did not know if they had another party beginning at four. At 3:30 Ben comes in and informs me very rudely if I don't get out and that's a direct quote by 345 he was going to charge me for an additional hour for the party room and kids. There were two other girls there both Looked like they were 16. I only dealt with one other and she was just as rude.. I see when I arrived Because I was annoyed, they wouldn't let me set the cake down and the manager appeared from the back room. She said that I could go ahead and put the cake down in the room and then promptly left and I never saw her again.

Review: The maintenance is not up-kept at all. My daughter is 3, and was jumping on the kids only section. She took a step on one of the pads and fell through, landing on the ground which was not padded at all. The padding has Velcro, which wasn’t attached and had a spring missing so she fell completely to the ground…back of her neck is scratched & swollen, along with her shoulder and a  bruise on her rib area. I know it’s a jump park and accidents happen but this is just ridiculous.

The bathrooms are dirty with  have uneven floors that you can trip on. The ball bit had many broken balls. The one tube made of netting that's high off the ground was broken , missing screws had holes in it. Many holes in play equipment, tape holding things together. We left after 20 minutes. Waste of money and time. I wish I would have done a charge back on my card but forgot and now too much time has passed.

Review: I would give zero stars but that's not even am option!

The facility is disgusting, lacking cleanliness.

The top of the play area is NOT netted and there is a 10+ foot drop.

The balls in ball pit were mostly broken and hurt my childrens feet. The netting was too big in the 2nd floor of the play area causing my child to fall in and get stuck. The trampolines spring covers were broken causing my child to trip.

When staff were notified they acted as if I was lying. I fully intend on disputing the $31 charge !! The place is a law suit and a death trap!

Tape was holding the slide together, dirty floors. Screws coming undone IN the slides. I will NEVER return when I asked for a manager apparently no one working there knew who the manager is. Hopefully this gets back to them and changes are made.

Review: My 7 year one had fun- that’s the plus. But this facility looks run down. Broken floor tiles, worn padding on the playground equipment, broken netting. It took three tries to get the correct WiFi password but it still had an error and you can’t get on the internet. One out of three bathroom stalls had toilet paper. There was water all over the bathroom floor. The whole place felt dirty and not well kept. We tried it a second time. Half way through the kids play time we were told we had to have their brand of play sock on. This wasn’t the case on our first visit nor when we entered. We left. We will not be back. We’re also reporting several safety issues to the attorney general's office as there is not netting to prevent children from getting on top of the equipment more than 10 feet off the ground. This place is dirty and not safe.

Review: The two ladies at the check in desk were very nice and attentive. They went out of their way to assist me with my needs. I love the variety of food and snacks they have to offer. The music is equally appropriate for children and adults; very fun and entertaining. The only reason I didn’t give full five stars is because the section where the ball pit is and the climbing area with tunnels could use a nice cleaning. It would be helpful to maybe do a quick wipe down of that area every hour. Everything else was really nice along with excellent service.

Reviewer: Steve Santer

Review: Many previous reviews have discussed the lack of cleanliness and professionalism at this business. So my review will speak to the safety concerns I observed while my two kids were playing at the playground.

1. Lack of netting above equipment. All major overhead areas of an indoor playground need to have fire and rip resistant netting to keep children from climbing over the sides of the equipment and suffering injury and death from a fall. Flyover park has a lack of this netting in any of their equipment that is above ten feet high. This is a direct violation of the ASTM industry standards, the group who licenses indoor playgrounds such as ""Flyover Fun Park"". Attached photos show the lack of netting where it needs to be.

2. Lack of staffing for a playground of this size. When we were there, I observed four staff. One was in training, and one was behind the concession stand. I would also imagine this is what is causing the lack of cleanliness in the facility. Having this few staff means that the playground can't be correctly supervised and safety issues can't/ won't be addressed. At minimum, there should be six staff with two who are focused exclusively on children's safety. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told there wasn't one on site. This begs the question, who is in charge?

3. Lack of public water: My kids were thirsty and I asked about a water fountain. I was told they didn't have one, and to buy a bottle of water. I understand this is a business, but profiting off thirsty children who are forced to pay for water seems a horrible way to make money.

Seeing the recent negative reviews shows a lack of caring about customers, but I would have hoped Flyover would care about keeping kids safe. Clearly this is not the case.

I also don't know how people can give it such bad reviews. The place was spotless and the employees were all so nice and actually working! I didn't see any of them playing on their phones. They all kept busy and were great at keeping the establishment clean. There was so much to do there and all the equipment was clean, safe and in working order. The snack bar had a great variety of things and their pizza and funnel cakes were delicious! Also, between the snack bar and the tickets to get in, the prices can't be beat! We didnt play the arcade because truthfully my boys are just too young so I can't really give a review on the games. I can't wait to book birthday parties here because my kids had a blast and can't wait to go back with their buddies. Don't listen to all the bad reviews. You need to check out the place for yourself. We had a great experience!

Review: We've been there a number of times before and it usually was quite excellent. However, this last time I found the staff to be quite indifferent about a mysterious liquid pooled inside the castle bounce house. In my opinion they were not responsive  about any of it. In fact it remained open for the hour and a half that we were still there, allowing other children to presumably get their socks and pants wet. If you want parents to feel comfortable about bringing their children here you really need to be more proactive when it comes to safety / hygiene issues. My children and I took it upon ourselves to suggest that others stay clear. It's too bad I feel dissatisfied considering the amount of money spent there. Otherwise it was a five-star experience for the kids

Review: Very nice party! We had our son’s 8th bday party here on a Saturday at Noon. The facility was not too packed. Our party assistant, Wendy, was very attentive, responding quickly to any of our requests, and did not make us feel rushed at all. I requested additional drinks and water to be brought out early which they happily accommodated; there is of course a limit to how many drinks are provided with the party package but we were allowed to purchase as many more as we would like.
The kids had an AMAZING time. Pizza was delicious! The party room was a nice size. We were allowed to put up our own decorations (with tacks which she provided for us) and we were allowed to set up 30 mins before.
There’s a nice sitting area for the parents to relax and enjoy as well. I’ve read previous reviews that unfortunately did not have the same experience but it seems there may have been some improvements made because we had a lovely time here! Kudos to Wendy for making our party experience wonderful ☺️

I reserved the party last minute two weeks prior  but was able to stop in to view the venue and call with my many questions. Place is very clean and has variety of activities for kids/adults too! Food (pizza/wings) were delicious. I will always recommend this place.

Review: This place is disgusting and the manager, Lynn, is awful to deal with.
I booked this place for a birthday party and they kept changing the rules as the party went on. I would challenge the ""rules"" by asking questions because they made no sense. I guess they didn't like that I asked the questions and I ended up being told to leave and they would refund my money. Yes, gladly, give me a refund. NEVER have I been treated with as much disrespect as the manager treated me. She was making mocking faces and saying she ran this business for years.  I'm not sure what her problem was, but glad she's not my problem anymore. I guess they don't care since the business is for sale.

Review: Party Goers BEWARE!!!!!  This place deserves zero stars. This place is a dump, not only is it dirty, the management lacks customer service. I'm honestly surprised they are in business.

I booked this place for my son's birthday party, if you want your kids to stay hydrated, forget it. The drinks you pay for in the party package will not come out until the food comes which is after the hour of play time. You are not allowed to bring your own water in, I was told I had to take it back out to the car. There are no water fountains to use either and they do not provide courtesy waters for parties. They do this so you'll buy the $1/bottle water,  as a host that can add up if you are buying water for the whole party. I ended up taking the kids out to the car in groups so they could drink water at the car.

Also, if you book a party room, you are not allowed to utilize the party room until after the first hour, when the food gets there. I booked it 4-6 and was told I had to leave the room until 5. Do not and I repeat DO NOT since on the bench outside the room, it is wobbly, my father-in-law almost busted himself falling off it.

Furthermore, do not talk to your friends at the party about the issues you are having with the party, the manager, Lynn Duphily, gets really mad and immature (mockingly immature) and will kick you out. I'm glad I got my refund and they didn't get an ounce of my money. To get the refund was an event in itself. After we packed everything up and everyone is waiting in the car, I went to get my refund receipt and was told ""You'll get your refund whenever she is ready to give it to you"". We left and had an amazing party elsewhere.

Review: This is the second party we had at fly over. The first one was a disaster but I was giving them grace -2 years ago. So we tried again. Nothing has changed. I called a weeks ahead to add more pizza and asked to bring in fruit tray. The lady on phone said yes . When we got to the place they told me we are not suppose to bring food. The lady on the phone also said to come 5 minutes early to decorate. So we did and they then informed me that we could t get into the room til “3” when the pizza comes . They did let us in the room 30 minutes early to decorate. The pizza came 25 minutes late and then they were very rude at telling us to leave the room because the other party was here . We let them know the pizza was 23 minutes late and that’s why we were late leaving the too . They do not give themselves enough buffer room for pizza being late and not enough time for families to decorate. No kid wants plain paper plates ,napkins at a party. Glad we brought our own decorations.  Will not be going back- it’s a circus -lack of communication

Review: I had my daughters 10th birthday here. I made it in very short notice and possibly the team didn't even know we were coming because I had sent emails trying to get information and to ask to update the party number count. No one gave us any direction about how the party was to go, just you are basically just renting the room and basic table covers plain paper plates and only forks and nothing was done beforehand thank goodness we had our own decorations.  We had 15 kids in our party that only accounted for 8 but we were the only ones there and plenty of staff who could have assisted in making things more fun for kids with direction and interaction.  You work at fun park, have fun come on! In the end it just seems no one was prepared for us and seems it would have been better to just have all our friends come without paying the extra money for the room. They did say we may could be on their commercial which would make the kids extra happy so I guess thats all that matters right? The kids had fun but wanted more time.

Review: This place is a disaster. We booked a birthday party here and we’re not given access to the room until almost 35 minutes after the beginning of the party. The woman who said she was the manager then tried to charge us for socks despite the fact we paid to have a party for 12 kids. After that I basically had to beg for them to bring pizza in for the kids to eat. There has to be nicer places than this if you’re looking for somewhere to have a birthday party for your kid.
It’s filthy as well.

Review: We aren't familiar with the area. When researching it, it appeared to have a lot more trampolines and jumping opportunities.

Our group had 13 and 10 year old, it was more appropriate for younger.
They also had a small arcade.
One hour session more than enough .

Prices are reasonable for everything.

The floors of needed a good cleaning and in the back of the jumping portions were left over materials, tools, and a ladder.
The public could have easily caused trouble with the tools.

Staff was inattentive to surroundings, but small very young crowd there wasn't any reason to have strict observations.

All in all if my kids were younger , we would go back .

Review: This place is okay. Not Skyzone levels at all. When I took my kids it was pretty empty (because I timed it well). I'd say this is better for younger kids.. think 10 and below. There was a good amount of trampolines for the size of the place. They had a small ""arcade"". To play you had to buy cards and points. The staff was barebones and Idk what their roles were. I'm guessing if you schedule a party there'd be food made because... there was no food ready to eat. I didn't have a problem with the music but, there were some songs that weren't clean. Lastly, if you know the Rodney Village Shopping Center, you should know what to expect.

My son absolutely loves it here.  I equally love watching him have such a good time.  Jungle Land is exceptionally clean, has tons of activities, and is perfectly maintained.  The staff are always professional, friendly, and kind.  I always look forward to the days I get to come here with my son.  Keep up the fantastic work!

And they have those old fashioned red and yellow little tykes cars for them to drive around…and much more. We went at the 5pm slot and I saw some families get or bring food for dinner at 6 halfway through the play time. Genius! We love it!!

Review: Jungle land is a very good place for kids, I have been here couple of times and my kids enjoyed alot.
However,
It is my sons birthday today which is on a monday and as they don’t offer birthday parties on Monday, I booked play for my 2 sons and 6 of his friends.

I called Jungle Land 1 time before booking and 1 time prior to coming on Monday for confirmation about few things, I asked them
if we can cut a cake, they told cake cutting is not allowed if it’s not booked for a party, which is understandable.
I also asked if I can get a balloon and click pics, the staff told yes I can.
I also asked if I can bring food and snacks
They told yes “any” food except for nuts.
I also checked website, it tells the same about food, “Please feel free to bring any food and drinks that you would like except nut products”.

I reached the venue without a cake as told by them
I got a number 3 balloon.,which they refused me to take inside, I agreed and kept back the balloon in my car.
I got pizza and noodles.
They told noodles are not allowed only pizza can be eaten, I agreed and kept back.
I agreed peacefully because I didn’t want my sons birthday to end on a bad note.

I just want Jungle Land to be more clear about the rules on there website and requests all the staff to be on the same page.
If they were clear about the rules, I would have only done what they expect, and it would have been the best experience.

It's CLEAN and bright, there's lots to do, the price is great, and the owner is a sweet lady who has a 2 year old herself. My favorite part is probably the 'sensory room'- I appreciate the inclusion.

Great place, we trade of between here and kids jungle land in white Marsh. Because the entire ceiling and walls of KidzVille is black and I find it dark and claustrophobic, and there is no where for normal adults to sit comfortably, I  personally prefer kids jungle land which is much more spacious and bright  and has better running and climbing opportunities. They both have great things to do .

Review: Kidzville with the boys last night in Perry Hall!  I was pleasantly surprised how cool the place is and they didn’t try to upcharge everything.  There weren’t any arcade games which I loved.  No tickets to win and cash in for some unnecessary junk. I think admission was 13.99 and you need slipper socks.  They were $2.95 so very reasonable.  It was a big indoor playground with lots of stuff for the kids to do. Perfrct for a rainy night.

The only food they sold was cheese or pepperoni pizza.  You had to buy a whole pizza.  $18 for a 16 inch cheese which was reasonable.  The pizza was also really good.

In addition to the pizzas they had a freezer of ice creams.  They also had water, juice, sodas and coffee pods.  Waters were $2 and juice was $2.50.  Thats all they had which was perfect.  They didn’t even sell candy. Prices were very reasonable!

The boys were exhausted when we left there.

I will definitely go back.

Unfortunately they do not allow you to bring your own food and the food they sell is full of sugar , food coloring, salt and unhealthy options. This is a problem if your child is not used to unhealthy food.

Up front at the registers, there's an ice cream freezer & small refrigerator with bottled water and juice boxes for purchase. Pizzas are also ordered at the register and sold by the pie.

No-slip shoes are available to put on for the bathroom (so that you don't walk in there with just your socks). There's a very long wall of cubbies heading into the play area, in order to put your shoes & belongings up.

It is slightly pricey though- it should be cheaper for kids <3 years old as they cannot take advantage of many areas

Note: When going for the first time, keep in mind that there is also a place called ""Kids Zone"" in the same building with a big colorful sign, which is apparently a daycare center not connected with KidzVille, so make sure you go to the correct door.

Review: We took the kids to play in kidzville perry hall to play My daughter wasn't wearing one foot for the socks because her feet was twisted and had to put brackets we didn't go out for a long day and she barely started walking After a while about 30-40 min playing with one socks on and the injuries one wasn't A mom having a kid came to me and telling me that this is disinfectant for others and i am asking you either to let your daughter put it on or leave. I explained nicely about her and she said I don't care. so i replied please watch your kid and mind your business, the kids have been playing and the staff saw her and no one told us anything i told here the kids is sneezing coughing and most of them are sick with no mask and were eating and then play without even washing hands. Here is the problem she didn't like that we are muslims and because one of the staff was the same race and from the same country and they talked their language, the staff member came to me and asked me to leave in a very rude way. I was shocked about her attitude and being in her side because of the same race and country and i asked her for a manager or customer service number she said oh here is the number do what you want. I paid 97 $ for 4 kids for 45 min I tried reaching the corporate number but i didn't get it Please share as much as you can and try to let whoever is the manager or the owner is to know

Review: My kids had a blast. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the music was too loud and noisy and ended up giving me a headache. We left sooner than we had planned because of that. We've been to similar places in the past that had softer/quieter music or no music at all and the kids still had an amazing time. If you want to improve parent's experience, please consider lowering the music. Also, better food/coffee options would be great.

My daughter is pretty excited about this play area as there are lot of animals she can identify, enjoy on the slides as well. The area appears to be pretty clean with a train ride right outside the entrance.

Cons:
lot of older kids run wildly, climb on the structures, always unsupervised. The play area signage mentions height limit of 42"" and prohibits kids from climbing and jumping. None of it is followed. My daughter has been hit multiple times and this poses a great risk to other smaller children as well. Not sure where to register a complaint

Head of security & maintenance told me himself that they do not clean midday as indicated by the signage outside of the play area. I have sent messages to the Tyson’s management twice asking that they please address the bad odor and clean it better more regularly. They have never replied. We’ve opted to go to Fair Oaks more frequently since their play space is cleaner and they also have an additional small play space for babies in a separate area.

Review: I recently took my daughter to the Pikesville Bubala Indoor Playground location at 3:50 p.m. The sign on the door said 10-5 p.m. It appeared to be closed as the lights were partially off, however, the door was open. We went inside only to find the employee hidden in one of the play areas with her tablet and it appeared she had been napping. When she saw us she got up and said they were closing because there were no customers. I stated that the hours listed said until 5 p.m. but the employee insisted that she was closing. I asked he if my daughter could play for the remaining of the time left and the employee said no. My daughter was visibly upset, and at that point, it wasn’t worth the argument, the employee had clearly decided to close, regardless of the fact that we were paying customers. It’s disappointing to see this location not being cared for, especially since it’s the closest indoor playground in the Pikesville area geared toward younger children.

I truly hope the owner takes the time to reevaluate the customer service standards and considers hiring staff who are genuinely committed to creating a positive experience for families, rather than simply showing up for a paycheck. Perhaps the owner would consider selling to someone who lives in the community and has a genuine passion for revitalizing this Bubala location, bringing it back to what it once was, or even making it better. This place has so much potential, and it would be a shame to see it close down permanently.

Review: We hosted our daughters 3rd birthday party here and although the children had fun in the play area, we won’t be returning for two important reasons:

1) The chairs provided for the children are hazardous because of their design, causing them to collapse under the toddlers weight and usually leading the kids to bang their faces or chins on the table in front of them. This happened to at least 7 children in our party and parents had to constantly catch their kids to prevent more of them from falling and crashing into the table when just trying to sit on the chairs. It sounds trivial but it’s a major safety issue that really worsened our party experience.

2) The equipment and interior is pretty run down and worn out. There’s just no way to not notice how worn and dirty everything is. Because you’re paying the same amount as having your party at a nicer and newer facility, I would not recommend hosting a kids party here since you really don’t get the value for what you’re paying for.

Additionally, the cleanliness of the space was questionable, which is especially concerning in an area meant for children.

Review: I shared all of this including pictures in an email to the owner. But I wanted to be sure I share the experience here as well. I threw a party for my 4 yo son today at Bubala in Reisterstown.

The party room itself was extremely run down. The paint is peeling and the furniture is torn apart - I’ve attached photos. I understand this is a children’s play center but as someone who paid over $20 per child attending this party; my expectation was that the party room would look presentable and I wouldn’t need to figure out how to hide the things which were falling apart.

The chairs in the party room are a hazard for small children. We had at least 5 kids fall down while sitting and the chairs collapse in on them. The bottoms are plastic instead of rubber; this combined with the vinyl flooring made them a liability and very easy for kids to hurt themselves.

Lastly, the person working today…I was told I’d have a host to help me decorate. Thank goodness I had my parents meet me because I received no help. The person working was lackluster, at best. They didn’t inform me when the pizzas arrived. Multiple guests shared how unpleasant the person working was at check in. The most conversation I got was when they told me we needed to leave in 10 mins for another party coming in and when they were ready to take my payment.

The saving grace was that my son and the kids had fun in the play space. I wouldn't recommend paying for a party here unless the above it ratified.

The overhead didn’t work and they had it rolled up and there were missing paint spots on the wall as well as the party room had an odor to it. The floor was sticky and if the party room isn’t being cleaned I can only imagine if the play area gets sanitized.

The playground is on the smaller side which actually makes it perfect for 2 and 3 year olds. The party room is a lovely blank canvas for decorating with plenty of space. The pizza was decent and came in hot right before lunchtime. They let you bring in cold food, deserts and drinks and they were so easy going. You have the party room 30min in advance to set up and then access to it for the entire 2hrs party. A great deal and a really lovely party space for the little ones.

The setup in the party room was perfect. We had the entire place to ourselves. Great children's music (Gracie's Corner) was played throughout the place. My daughter loves gracies corner. The staff was amazing and helped with everything from carrying in items for the planned party, decorating the party room, helping assist with scheduled activities-pizza, cake cutting, etc. The staff also ensured everyone was having a great time and helping whenever anyone needed anything (very attentive). I see why they are number 1 with toddler party's. My daughter loved having her 3rd birthday party here. My guest stated how this place was the best place they have been to for a toddler's party-parking was easy, spacious, and very kid friendly. Definitely plan on visiting this location again in the future.

Review: I recently revisited Bubala's Indoor Playground over the weekend, and I must say, my recent experience only reinforced my positive impressions from my initial visit. However, I can't help but express my dissatisfaction with the deletion of my previous review, which praised Dreshawna, one of Bubala's stellar employees. Initially, I was disheartened to find my earlier accolades for Dreshawna's exceptional cleaning skills erased from the platform. Nevertheless, my disappointment turned to delight upon returning to the facility and discovering that she not only still works there but continues to exhibit the same level of excellence that initially impressed me. The dedication to maintaining a clean and hygienic environment at Bubala's is truly commendable. The indoor playground itself continues to be a fantastic space for children to explore and play. While I stand by my previous praise for Dreshawna, I hope this review remains intact to convey my satisfaction with her consistent performance. My only suggestion would be to ensure that customer reviews are treated with the importance they deserve, fostering a transparent and honest reflection of the establishment's strengths.

It was clean, with a good amount of activities for the kids, and staff was friendly. I am glad we went the kids had a blast. We will be going back!

Review: Honest review! Read the reviews before you book a party, because I read the 1 star reviews, I avoided issues and had a wonderful time! My son had his 1st birthday there, perfect venue. We had soooo much fun.

I see people saying the staff is young & there’s no management on site, true! But I’m young too so I had a lot of fun with the staff lol. They legit just follow the rules to a T, if that bothers you idk what to tell you.

PAY THE EXTRA $100 TO BRING YOUR OWN FOOD! The pizza provided sucks lol. I don’t know *why* it costs more to bring food but it does.

The projector doesnt work. It’s there, but it’s not usable so don’t plan to use it.

You will get 30 mins to set up, so create all your decorations and organize them at home. Do your best! This is a children’s party not a wedding, the room is cute even without decor! I know we all love our kids but how much decorations does a kiddie party need?

WE HAD SO MUCH FUN! My son had fun, all the kids had fun & we made amazing memories. It is not a grandiose venue, but it’s affordable and fun. I still give it 5 stars & I might have his 2nd birthday party there too 🎉🥳

Review: My daughter just had her 2nd birthday party here. I booked a private party with and additional hour. I arrived to an empty facility at 3:15 (my party was scheduled for 4pm) was greeted by a young girl who advised that per management she was not allowed to let us in to doctorate until 3:30. That was strike one, during the party I ran out of plates and asked if I could get plates (which the facility provides for parties) and was advised because I brought my own decorations I could only be given 10 plates per management when I paid for a party for 25 kids (strike 2). When the pizza arrived it the establishment policy that we should feed 25 kids from one large pizza that is cut into tiny slices. I paid to have an extra hour on my party to be told that I would only have until 6:30 because it policy that the facility is clean and closed at 7pm. So at 6:30 the young ladies on staff began to clean over top of my guest! Which is totally unacceptable! So I’m essentially I did not get an extra hour, I paid for nothing. Although the staff is friendly they are merely children running a business. They blame everything on management, but there’s no management representation on site! When asked to have the manager number that request was denied! I low key want some of my money back! The place is cute for small children, but I would NEVER patronize this place again!

Review: Because this store is frequently closed and we were driving from downtown Baltimore, we called ahead today (7/25) about coming in and were told that they would stay open until 5pm. We arrived at 3:45 and the girl at the counter (AirPods in, talking on her phone) told us that they were closing early. We mentioned that we had called ahead and she said that due to low business volume the owner had said to close early. We asked if there was any way she could recontact the owner to stay open and she refused. We asked if my 4 year old could play for 10 minutes while she went about closing the shop (I dunno, closing the register and cleaning the bathroom perhaps?) and she refused. The additional overhead for 10-30 minutes of play would have been negligible, and my daughter’s disappointment was palpable. We intentionally don’t promise a trip to Bubala unless we confirm that they’re open for business, and this was poor customer service and frank laziness on this employee’s part. Sounds like it’s only Hyperkidz from now on.

Review: DO NOT USE THIS PLACE…Had a 1st birthday party for my granddaughter there, the place was filthy.  They moved our time back an hour saying there was a booking conflict, and that they needed time to disinfect the play area.  However a friend who didn’t get the time change notification sat outside for an hour, never saw any staff cleaning anything .  The bathrooms were dirty, and at one point out of tissue paper.  The staff was almost nonexistent since she just sat there on her phone the entire time.  No interaction no knowledge just gave me the contacts number, who never even responded to my calls.  Horrible customer service

parents & children. we had special needs child that they had any knowledge of how to deal with him. We also received a pizza with the package and it was flip upside down.We was informed that the staff were all new employees which I honestly think they need additional training to deal with children.THIS IS A DNR (DO NOT RETURN) with no recommendations for anyone

There was a little school bus carousel that all the kids seemed to adore, a ball pit, slides into the ball pit and so much more! The young lady behind the front desk both times we went was so sweet and friendly, and she was always cleaning surfaces and keeping things tidy. Really happy with our time here - we were visiting for the week and I will be so sad that we won't be able to be back for a while. What a gem!

It's a perfect place for toddlers to play, especially when the weather isn’t great outside. The colorful theme and variety of rides make it fun for both little ones and older kids.

Review: We visited Kidz Jungle World on Christmas Eve, and it was an absolute delight! Despite being a busy holiday, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better. The play equipment was impressively clean, showing the care and effort put into maintaining the facility.

One of the standout features for us was the high weight limit on the equipment, allowing parents to join in the fun without worry. It’s also fantastic that parents enter for free – a thoughtful touch that sets this soft play centre apart from others.

The entrance fee being a whole-day pass is excellent value, and we appreciated the flexibility it gave us. Our two-year-old absolutely loved exploring all the different areas, and we would have stayed even longer if we didn’t have other commitments.

Overall, we had a wonderful time and would highly recommend Kidz Jungle World to anyone looking for a fun, family-friendly outing. It’s a perfect spot for kids to play, laugh, and burn off energy while parents can relax or join in. A solid 5/5 experience!

Review: We had our daughter’s 1st birthday here and it was amazing. Every once in a while I would bring my daughter to play leading up to her first birthday and she’s always had a ball. On the day of her party the staff made sure everything went smoothly. Leading up the party, I received a call to ensure I understood everything and to help with anything else I needed. I’m thankful for their care of their customers and making accommodations even at the last minute. The kids had fun and so did the adults!

Review: My son and I visited here, and I just have to give a special thanks to Mrs. Sheri! She was incredibly patient with my son and kept engaging him with such kindness and care. Her warm and friendly approach made him feel comfortable right away, and he had such a great time. Mrs. Sheri truly knows how to make each child feel special. We’re so grateful for her attention and the wonderful experience!

Review: Balls are extremely DIRTY!!! Black dirt all over most of the balls in the ball pit! They do not clean them at all, but they charge the same price as places that clean their balls. Don’t let your kids play at this place until they CLEAN their ball pit!!!! So upset that this is a kids facility and they have a ball pit that looks neglected.

Review: I've been coming to Jungle Kids world since it opened. The customer service has been consistently kind, helpful, and quick (at reception). Over the past two years the gun machine have never been working when we go. Now the machine that makes the balls pop up doesn't work. And the tube that sucks up balls also doesn't work and so that means the area where the balls collect cannot be used to make all the balls fall down. The tree swing was gone and the metal Zipline that my son lives was also broken. The floors felt sticky. I feel like this place is on the decline. I hope they get it together. It's very disappointing. We come here often because it's close to my house and the kids love it. In fairness they did still have a good time. So one star for customer service and one for the kids having a good time.

Review: Highly recommend. My almost 3 year old had a fantastic time and after 1.5 hour’s he is worn out and satisfied. They had so many obstacles and my son didn’t want to leave. Take your child here if you want to tire him/her out.

One of the things that stood out was the front desk employee Arnetia. You can tell she genuinely loves her job! I observed her and she treated everyone with such kindness. We came near closing time and not once did we feel rushed to leave. The entire time she kept busy mopping and cleaning (which by the way as soon as you walk in you can smell the cleanliness of the place). When she wasn’t cleaning she was happily engaging with the children making sure they were safe. It’s rare that I meet someone with such a gentle and sunny disposition. Arnetia is the kind of employee you want representing your company. I hope someone in corporate reads this. Keep hiring employees like her and you’ll stay in business for years to come.

Review: This is an absolutely wonderful, clean, bright children's facility for indoor play. The center is especially children friendly; providing safe equipment and a snack bar, even dip n dots! I have held two birthday parties at this location within the past 2 years and both experiences were excellent. The staff has timely communications, is very friendly and is very attentive even to last-minute changes. The birthday packages are flexible and very reasonably priced. I had a birthday party for my son here last weekend and everyone had a wonderful time including the parents because there are plenty of places for parents to hang out. Fun, cleanliness and affordability check check check!! Thank you so much Kidz Jungle World I really appreciate you!!

The water in the trampoline that’s in the tiny kids corner is filthy . It looks green & def not sanitary . The guns over in the ball pit don’t work . And once bigger kids start coming , it gets really hectic cause the workers don’t really pay attention to what’s going on. My kids almost got trampled on a few times from teenagers rough housing .

Review: What a fantastic experience. The kids had a blast for over 2 and a half hours and there was a variety of things for all ages to do (18 months - 8 years in our group). The woman working was phenomenal in making sure the environment was clean and safe and went above and beyond in showing me a easy way to the slide for me and the littlest one to slide down together without having to climb through the whole structure. Additionally, she went out of her way to show the kids how to fill the foam ball blower so that the balls cascaded everywhere to the delight of the children. The largest play structure has a variety of passages, but all of the entrances and exits are condensed toward the front for easy viewing from the two smaller play areas where parents would accompany younger children allowing them to also keep and eye on their older ones. We can't wait to go again in the future!

Review: I recently took my daughter to the Pikesville Bubala Indoor Playground location at 3:50 p.m. The sign on the door said 10-5 p.m. It appeared to be closed as the lights were partially off, however, the door was open. We went inside only to find the employee hidden in one of the play areas with her tablet and it appeared she had been napping. When she saw us she got up and said they were closing because there were no customers. I stated that the hours listed said until 5 p.m. but the employee insisted that she was closing. I asked he if my daughter could play for the remaining of the time left and the employee said no. My daughter was visibly upset, and at that point, it wasn’t worth the argument, the employee had clearly decided to close, regardless of the fact that we were paying customers. It’s disappointing to see this location not being cared for, especially since it’s the closest indoor playground in the Pikesville area geared toward younger children.

I truly hope the owner takes the time to reevaluate the customer service standards and considers hiring staff who are genuinely committed to creating a positive experience for families, rather than simply showing up for a paycheck. Perhaps the owner would consider selling to someone who lives in the community and has a genuine passion for revitalizing this Bubala location, bringing it back to what it once was, or even making it better. This place has so much potential, and it would be a shame to see it close down permanently.

Review: We hosted our daughters 3rd birthday party here and although the children had fun in the play area, we won’t be returning for two important reasons:

1) The chairs provided for the children are hazardous because of their design, causing them to collapse under the toddlers weight and usually leading the kids to bang their faces or chins on the table in front of them. This happened to at least 7 children in our party and parents had to constantly catch their kids to prevent more of them from falling and crashing into the table when just trying to sit on the chairs. It sounds trivial but it’s a major safety issue that really worsened our party experience.

2) The equipment and interior is pretty run down and worn out. There’s just no way to not notice how worn and dirty everything is. Because you’re paying the same amount as having your party at a nicer and newer facility, I would not recommend hosting a kids party here since you really don’t get the value for what you’re paying for.

Additionally, the cleanliness of the space was questionable, which is especially concerning in an area meant for children.

Review: I shared all of this including pictures in an email to the owner. But I wanted to be sure I share the experience here as well. I threw a party for my 4 yo son today at Bubala in Reisterstown.

The party room itself was extremely run down. The paint is peeling and the furniture is torn apart - I’ve attached photos. I understand this is a children’s play center but as someone who paid over $20 per child attending this party; my expectation was that the party room would look presentable and I wouldn’t need to figure out how to hide the things which were falling apart.

The chairs in the party room are a hazard for small children. We had at least 5 kids fall down while sitting and the chairs collapse in on them. The bottoms are plastic instead of rubber; this combined with the vinyl flooring made them a liability and very easy for kids to hurt themselves.

Lastly, the person working today…I was told I’d have a host to help me decorate. Thank goodness I had my parents meet me because I received no help. The person working was lackluster, at best. They didn’t inform me when the pizzas arrived. Multiple guests shared how unpleasant the person working was at check in. The most conversation I got was when they told me we needed to leave in 10 mins for another party coming in and when they were ready to take my payment.

The saving grace was that my son and the kids had fun in the play space. I wouldn't recommend paying for a party here unless the above it ratified.

The overhead didn’t work and they had it rolled up and there were missing paint spots on the wall as well as the party room had an odor to it. The floor was sticky and if the party room isn’t being cleaned I can only imagine if the play area gets sanitized.

Review: We had my daughter's second birthday party here and it was such a wonderful time. The staff is incredibly friendly and the place was clean. The playground is on the smaller side which actually makes it perfect for 2 and 3 year olds. The party room is a lovely blank canvas for decorating with plenty of space. The pizza was decent and came in hot right before lunchtime. They let you bring in cold food, deserts and drinks and they were so easy going. You have the party room 30min in advance to set up and then access to it for the entire 2hrs party. A great deal and a really lovely party space for the little ones.

My only complaints is, my daughter’s socks were beyond black, and the party room floor was sticky, which tells me the carpets and floors aren’t cleaned often, if at all. I wasn’t even willing to bring the socks home to put them in my washer. BUBULA, you have to do better, because this is a great place for the little ones to play.

Review: Had our daughter's 2nd birthday here last weekend - WONDERFUL! Perfect size for 10 kids and parents, all the equipment was the right age level for them to do on their own. The party room was adorable with the little chairs! They provide linens, plates, napkins and a pizza which worked out great, we just decorated. The place smelled clean and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend.

Review: The kiddos had so much fun. Great place for 2- 7 year old to run & play. The staff was not very friendly or engaging. They were on their phones the whole time, not engaging at all for any reason not really helpful with anything.

We were going to have a party but decided not too. They have snacks on deck if you want to make a purchase (water,chips, candy,etc).

I would still recommend for a place for kids to play.

Review: Took my 1 year old daughter last week and she loved it! Small compared to other indoor playgrounds, I didn't know most of the songs, but the other kids there were enjoying themselves and singing along so they're catering the music to the right audience.

Review: The place is beyond my expectations. Perfect inside toddler playground for a child's birthday party. Everything was clean and disinfected (before arriving and leaving). The setup in the party room was perfect. We had the entire place to ourselves. Great children's music (Gracie's Corner) was played throughout the place. My daughter loves gracies corner. The staff was amazing and helped with everything from carrying in items for the planned party, decorating the party room, helping assist with scheduled activities-pizza, cake cutting, etc. The staff also ensured everyone was having a great time and helping whenever anyone needed anything (very attentive). I see why they are number 1 with toddler party's. My daughter loved having her 3rd birthday party here. My guest stated how this place was the best place they have been to for a toddler's party-parking was easy, spacious, and very kid friendly. Definitely plan on visiting this location again in the future.

Review: I recently revisited Bubala's Indoor Playground over the weekend, and I must say, my recent experience only reinforced my positive impressions from my initial visit. However, I can't help but express my dissatisfaction with the deletion of my previous review, which praised Dreshawna, one of Bubala's stellar employees. Initially, I was disheartened to find my earlier accolades for Dreshawna's exceptional cleaning skills erased from the platform. Nevertheless, my disappointment turned to delight upon returning to the facility and discovering that she not only still works there but continues to exhibit the same level of excellence that initially impressed me. The dedication to maintaining a clean and hygienic environment at Bubala's is truly commendable. The indoor playground itself continues to be a fantastic space for children to explore and play. While I stand by my previous praise for Dreshawna, I hope this review remains intact to convey my satisfaction with her consistent performance. My only suggestion would be to ensure that customer reviews are treated with the importance they deserve, fostering a transparent and honest reflection of the establishment's strengths.

Review: Honest review! Read the reviews before you book a party, because I read the 1 star reviews, I avoided issues and had a wonderful time! My son had his 1st birthday there, perfect venue. We had soooo much fun.

I see people saying the staff is young & there’s no management on site, true! But I’m young too so I had a lot of fun with the staff lol. They legit just follow the rules to a T, if that bothers you idk what to tell you.

PAY THE EXTRA $100 TO BRING YOUR OWN FOOD! The pizza provided sucks lol. I don’t know *why* it costs more to bring food but it does.

The projector doesnt work. It’s there, but it’s not usable so don’t plan to use it.

You will get 30 mins to set up, so create all your decorations and organize them at home. Do your best! This is a children’s party not a wedding, the room is cute even without decor! I know we all love our kids but how much decorations does a kiddie party need?

WE HAD SO MUCH FUN! My son had fun, all the kids had fun & we made amazing memories. It is not a grandiose venue, but it’s affordable and fun. I still give it 5 stars & I might have his 2nd birthday party there too 🎉🥳

Review: My daughter just had her 2nd birthday party here. I booked a private party with and additional hour. I arrived to an empty facility at 3:15 (my party was scheduled for 4pm) was greeted by a young girl who advised that per management she was not allowed to let us in to doctorate until 3:30. That was strike one, during the party I ran out of plates and asked if I could get plates (which the facility provides for parties) and was advised because I brought my own decorations I could only be given 10 plates per management when I paid for a party for 25 kids (strike 2). When the pizza arrived it the establishment policy that we should feed 25 kids from one large pizza that is cut into tiny slices. I paid to have an extra hour on my party to be told that I would only have until 6:30 because it policy that the facility is clean and closed at 7pm. So at 6:30 the young ladies on staff began to clean over top of my guest! Which is totally unacceptable! So I’m essentially I did not get an extra hour, I paid for nothing. Although the staff is friendly they are merely children running a business. They blame everything on management, but there’s no management representation on site! When asked to have the manager number that request was denied! I low key want some of my money back! The place is cute for small children, but I would NEVER patronize this place again!

Review: Because this store is frequently closed and we were driving from downtown Baltimore, we called ahead today (7/25) about coming in and were told that they would stay open until 5pm. We arrived at 3:45 and the girl at the counter (AirPods in, talking on her phone) told us that they were closing early. We mentioned that we had called ahead and she said that due to low business volume the owner had said to close early. We asked if there was any way she could recontact the owner to stay open and she refused. We asked if my 4 year old could play for 10 minutes while she went about closing the shop (I dunno, closing the register and cleaning the bathroom perhaps?) and she refused. The additional overhead for 10-30 minutes of play would have been negligible, and my daughter’s disappointment was palpable. We intentionally don’t promise a trip to Bubala unless we confirm that they’re open for business, and this was poor customer service and frank laziness on this employee’s part. Sounds like it’s only Hyperkidz from now on.

Review: DO NOT USE THIS PLACE…Had a 1st birthday party for my granddaughter there, the place was filthy.  They moved our time back an hour saying there was a booking conflict, and that they needed time to disinfect the play area.  However a friend who didn’t get the time change notification sat outside for an hour, never saw any staff cleaning anything .  The bathrooms were dirty, and at one point out of tissue paper.  The staff was almost nonexistent since she just sat there on her phone the entire time.  No interaction no knowledge just gave me the contacts number, who never even responded to my calls.  Horrible customer service

parents & children. we had special needs child that they had any knowledge of how to deal with him. We also received a pizza with the package and it was flip upside down.We was informed that the staff were all new employees which I honestly think they need additional training to deal with children.THIS IS A DNR (DO NOT RETURN) with no recommendations for anyone

There was a little school bus carousel that all the kids seemed to adore, a ball pit, slides into the ball pit and so much more! The young lady behind the front desk both times we went was so sweet and friendly, and she was always cleaning surfaces and keeping things tidy. Really happy with our time here - we were visiting for the week and I will be so sad that we won't be able to be back for a while. What a gem!

Review: Charges the same as the other local indoor playgrounds but the quality is just lower across the board. Kids have to wear wrsitbands and grip socks for some reason, but the wristbands don't get you back in when you leave. Seems understaffed as well. Serve food right in the middle of the two play areas, so all the slides and surfaces are grimey.

Review: They are very random in their hours. I came many times. I found them closed without any announcement on the website. I called them to know their working hours because they are in a guard that is not written on the website. He assured me that they are present and open, and when I came, he said that after 1/2 hour the shop closes. They work according to their mood. I would have liked to know before I came to them. They wasted my time and the time of my children who are waiting to come to them. The joy and excitement are gone. I do not recommend coming to them according to a planned schedule.

Review: Nice playground with tables for the parents to sit and monitor the kids from a little distance
I also appreciated that both parents could get in with no extra charge.
The reason I give a 4 stars because there were some violent kids, making a mess and fighting all other kinds and no one intervened. I was hoping one of the employees would have stepped up and say/do something rather me looking for the parents and try to diffuse the situation

Review: I really wanted to like this place—it seemed like the perfect spot for my son to enjoy his birthday. To be sure they were open, I called on the day of his birthday, and the woman who answered assured me that they were.

We drove all the way from Stafford to Fairfax, arriving around 6 PM, well before their supposed closing time of 8 PM. After a long walk to get to Luv 2 Play, we were shocked to find it closed—despite being told otherwise.

To make matters worse, I’m pregnant, which made the unnecessary trip even more exhausting. I was beyond frustrated that we went out of our way for nothing, especially on such an important day. This kind of mismanagement and lack of communication is completely unacceptable.

And this is why I’m giving this place one star.

Review: My kids enjoyed it but there was throw up on the floor that took awhile for someone to clean up.  Keep an eye on your kids as the gate isn't manned and there were no bracelets to match parents with their kids.  Other playgrounds I've taken my kids too take more care to ensure children are safe.

If you love the smell of piss and getting treated badly, this is the place for you.

Review: I’ve visited this establishment many times with my children, but unfortunately, today’s experience was highly disappointing. The cleanliness of the facility was unacceptable, with a pervasive odor of urine throughout the premises. While it’s clear that some of this may be attributed to a lack of supervision from certain parents, who seem to treat the space like a daycare and neglect their responsibilities, it is equally concerning that the establishment itself is not maintaining proper sanitation standards. Both parties seem to be contributing to the overall decline of the environment, which ultimately detracts from what should be an enjoyable experience. Until improvements are made in both cleanliness and supervision, I will be reconsidering future visits.

Review: I give it two stars because we drove far away to get there and be told they close at 8:30 when the hours posted online says 10 am to 9pm. Had to use the bathroom as soon as we got there around 7:45 and the bathrooms were closed! The chairs where the parents sit were all picked up by 8:06pm. In addition there are two front desk ladies that were very rude. Making faces and ignoring our child while he is directly asking them questions about the spinning wheel. They could not be bothered. He has spinned the wheel before and won a whole month per a previous employee explained and added them to instagram as that was the deal. Never got an email or anything of the full month we won. I guess they have that for decoration only!

Review: We came for my toddler's birthday, but the play area is packed with arcade games that cost a ton of extra money on top of all of the money you spend to get in and little kids are impossible to redirect away from the flashing lights and incredibly loud baby gambling machines (that's literally what those types of machines are, and it's even worse since they prey on people with undeveloped frontal lobes so they're even more vulnerable to the lights and noises and *almost* winning). So it ruined the entire day because we had to constantly tell them no, we can't drop $100 to not get a dusty stuffed animal in a rigged claw machine so they couldn't fully enjoy the actual playground feature. And, on top of that, many things were broken, including some kind of shooter thing that they were looking forward to. The ball pit is barely a ball pit, the equipment wasn't clean at all, such a waste of time to drive all the way out to fairfax and a waste of money and, worst of all, ruined his birthday. Never thought I would say that anything at PG mall would ever beat something in Fairfax, but we will take junior playland at PG Plaza over this place ANY time.

Review: We went on our first visit and it went from worst to worst. We arrived and there was only one girl, about 2 years old, and her father, in the games, my child started to enter the games and everything was fine. Not an hour had passed and these girls began to clean with pure bleach or chlorine in the entire area where the two children were playing. That smell was so strong that you could feel and see the irritation in the eyes of both the children and us adults, I told the girl. Because they did that just when the two children were playing. So much so that my boy discolored his socks and shorts and I had the smell on my hands.😡.
Apart from that, they were repairing their gaming machines in such a way that you had nowhere else to run and after repairing one apparently you had to test it to see if it worked and that was an adult disorder.
Then I feel like reloading a card for the ball vending machines. Rubber ducks and candy with $15 because my son liked a duck. I was so angry to only have 5 attempts and lose $15😡🤬. Paying $13 might be nothing to some. Hyper KidZ charges $8. And it is a much larger place, without a doubt, the old known is better than the new to know.  I wish I could upload the photos.

Review: Avoid the monthly subscription. We purchased a monthly subscription for two and wanted to upgrade to three kids. The employee told us to cancel the first one and buy three kids subscription since they don't offer upgrades. We told her that the monthly payment is due the following day but she assured us that we will not be charged twice. We ended up charged for two subscriptions. The management then shifted the blame to us, claiming we didn't understand the terms and conditions. It seems like customers are expected to know more than the employees themselves. It's unacceptable that customers are held to a higher standard than their own staff.  This experience felt like a total scam.

The entire process is so simple, the staff is beyond accommodating and they do all of the hard work. I loved showing up with some extra snacks for the party goers and not worrying about all of the set up, clean up, etc. They keep the flow of the party moving so I could enjoy the party with my kids and her guests.

On top of everything else, it is so CLEAN. We love visiting Sunny Day to play and for special events and highly recommend the venue for birthdays. Thank you Caitlin and her crew!

As an early childhood educator, I can see the developmentally appropriate activities and creative and engaging areas making a positive impact on the physical and cognitive growth of the children. It’s clean and bright and well organized! The owners and staff are doing a great job! We will definitely be back!!

Review: The place was great. Snack bar, tables for adults to sit at, lots of space, great playset for bigger kids. Reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because although the rules say you MUST wear socks, some kids/adults were wearing shoes, some people were barefoot, which I think just makes the place get dirty faster. There were also kids climbing up the slides because they didn't have socks on, which is also a rule.  Overall was a great experience.

Review: After visiting Sunny Day over the past few months we decided to schedule my son's 4th birthday here. Caitlin was super responsive, thorough, and detail oriented. It made the party planning process seamless being that she handled basically everything (even set up and clean up) except getting us dressed and ready! We supplied our dessert of choice while everything else was handled from the playlist to decorations to food and beverage for the children down to the goody bags (which were awesome). We were also welcomed to bring anything additional including food and beverage for the adults. With the package we selected we got to choose our own unique theme and she went above and beyond to supply the decor to go with it. I also loved how we could add on several additional things from a menu had we wanted to. Everyone had a great time and we are so happy we chose to hold our party here!

Review: We hosted my son’s 3rd birthday here this past weekend and honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience! The facility itself is bright, spacious, clean, and has so many fun areas for the kids to play. We had kids from ages 8 months to 5 years and everyone had a blast. There was also plenty of space for the adults to mingle and still be able to keep an eye on the kids, which can be hard to find in other play places we’ve been to. The owner, Caitlin, and her staff were so welcoming and helpful. They ordered and set up all the decorations based on our party theme which made everything so easy. The birthday boy and all our guests had so much fun and have been talking about the party all weekend. Sunny Day is exactly what we needed in this area and we can’t wait to come back soon!

Review: BEST PARTY PLACE FOR LITTLE PEANUTS!!!!!

We had our granddaughter's 4th birthday party at Sunny Day Play Cafe yesterday!  I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about the event.  The owners, Jesse and Caitlin, couldn't have been more accommodating.  Communication prior to the party was efficient and prompt.  They were great when I asked to bring in ""adult"" food for the mommies and daddies (instead of serving them the kid's pizza and chicken tenders) -- no problem was the response.  When I asked to bring in my own face painter and balloon artist -- no problem was the answer (they even set up a ""station"" for this!!).  When we got there, Jesse was cleaning and sanitizing the venue from a previous party -- the place was spotless when he was done!  Throughout the entire event, Jesse kept things running smoothly -- a feat when he had 25 four year old littles and approximately 35 adults partying on to celebrate our little peanut!  Sunny Day had loot bags prepared for all of our little guests so everybody left with some treats in addition to the smiles on their faces!!  Thank you Jesse and Caitlin --  this party was a huge success because of your amazing play cafe and your caring and creative hosting skills!!
We'll be back to visit and play soon!!  Thanks again!!!

Review: We had my daughters 3rd birthday party at Sunny Day and it was amazing! The booking was seamless and Caitlin kept in communication regarding theme, guest list, etc. The space is huge and I love how the adults have a space of their own for coffee/eating/talking while the kids play. There are comfy couches for parents to sit positioned perfectly throughout the play area, as well. I especially loved the section catered to the ""little"" littles! We had some guests who were not yet a year of age and they had plenty of space to crawl, sit, and play away from the big kids and the big toys. The variety of pretend play is amazing, and the equipment is top notch. My favorite part was how CLEAN Sunny Day Play Cafe is. We had previous experience at a play place in West Chester and the lack of cleanliness, itself, kept us from going back. But Sunny Day Play Cafe was so clean, even the bathrooms! Caitlin was an amazing host and literally took care of everything down to party favor bags. We will 100% be back for more fun at Sunny Day Play Cafe!

Review: Sunny Day Play Cafe was an ideal venue for my daughter’s 4th birthday! Clean, bright and lots of fun play and party space for the kids! I particularly love that adults can socialize while kids play; as the space is small enough to see your child from just about anywhere, but large enough for kids to have plenty of room to run around! The owner (Caitlin) was attentive and helpful from start to finish with the planning, setup and cleanup of the party!

Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me. Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially a mom that needs to get out and socialize. Food is delicious!

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Review: Good idea for a small country town, although $12 admission for a nine month old baby is pretty steep. It's like a indoor playground with a steep slide.. Your better off driving to Salisbury going to sky zone getting your money's worth if you don't have a car and just want the kids to burn energy when it's cold outside go here.

Review: I held my daughters 3rd birthday here today. Me and my family have been here one other time, and were completely SOLD. Today just sealed the deal! Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: No words to explain how awesome this place is. My 20 month old loves it so much. Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me. Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially a mom that needs to get out and socialize. Food is delicious!

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛

Review: This place is a disaster waiting to happen! Where is all the staff? Kids are jumping off a platform and there was not one staff member the entire time I was in that area. Truly unbelievable! Also, I was watching the board (side of the platform) moving and looked like it could break, as it was very flimsy. If a kid fell through that they could get extremely injured. When I left I was in disbelief with the lack of safety precautions and staff supervision

Review: Yikes…. Not much to offer. This is definitely very low budget on the scale of trampoline parks. Not a whole lot to keep kids busy for “hours”. We were ready to leave shortly after arriving. There is essentially no seating for parents. Broken chairs and a few sticky massage chairs. Food/snacks limited as well as seating in that area too. Overall it’s not a place we ever will be returning to.

Review: This place is definitely a disappointment weekends are probably the worst time to come because of the birthday parties. The staff is children most likely 15 years old there’s no adults running this place. The young employees sit on their phones don’t monitor the children when they’re jumping or pushing other kids. There was blood all over the Mat I told the employee and he just looked at me and said yeah I know it’s been there for a while😳🤮 disgusting. Definitely run down they don’t clean the facility the floors peeling apart. Walked in the bathroom there was pee all over the floor! ordered two pepperoni pizzas Slices. ((Almost 9$)) the employee gave me tiny little pieces and I looked at him and said what is this?? people  are walking around with a full-size slices he said oh I can give you two other ones he never came back The pizza was cold. 😡 so I had to ask for a refund. Definitely coming here is a disappointment every time lately Most likely we will cancel our membership and go to a different facility! Have been coming here since they opened and it’s just gross and my kids don’t have fun anymore here! DO BETTER!!!

Review: My daughter managed to drop a small doll through the trampoline, and Omar and Kirubel came to our rescue. Without us even asking, they were immediately figuring out a plan to retrieve the doll. They went underneath the trampolines, on the far side of the facility, to fetch a small doll.

You don't see that kind of service and willingness often; I was beyond impressed with Omar and Kirubel. They were professional, helpful, kind, and went out of their way. When I shared my thanks, Kirubel said, ""it's our job."" A very humble response from two young men who went above and beyond. Two 10/10 employees!

Altitude, whatever you're paying them, they deserve a raise!!

But as many have alluded to, the cleanliness factor can really use some improvement. The urinal in the men’s room has been closed for months and the other two toilets are never clean. The little claw machines are in major need of repair, as is the water fountain. Just little things like this that don’t ruin the experience necessarily, but don’t help its reputation.

Review: I came here about a year ago with my daughter who was 2 years old at the time. There were kids of all ages running amuck without any staff supervision. I should have left then as this clearly wasn’t a good place for a 2 year old but we had paid our moneys worth so I figured we would stay for a little while, and thought maybe there would be a separate area to jump for smaller kids. I guess it’s my fault for not asking. Unfortunately, a bigger kid came barreling through the trampoline that my daughter was on and she broke her leg in two places. Not one staff member seemed concerned or asked if we were ok or needed help. Very disappointed all around. We won’t be back, even when she’s bigger.

Review: Safety- the biggest priority at a kids park like this- was not monitored well here. There was just one person watching the whole area and he seemed to only watch the jumping part. There’s a whole seperate dodgeball part that wasn’t monitored. The trouble is it’s mixed ages and no one monitoring. You had grown adult men in there trying to chuck the ball at their kids but missing and hitting other smaller kids, as well as older male teenagers doing the same. You have very tiny kids like 4 year olds mixed with 17 year olds .. if there no age restrictions or age zones/ it should at least be heavily monitored. For paying $21 plus socks plus tax for 2 hours, there should be more surveillance. My 4 year old son snuck into the area and ( open entry ways ) and came out two seconds later with a bloody lip in several places. I had him stay out of there.
A boy about 10 years  old was on the ground after getting a friendly hit, then an older kid saw him on the ground , went almost two feet away from his face- and slammed a ball right into his eyes/ forehead. He was crying and rolling in pain on the mat. Everyone including adults just stepped around him continuing to play. I went up to him, helped him out, and had him show me to his mom ( he couldn’t see very well due to the eyes injury ). He seemed a boy the type of age and demeanor where he wouldn’t cry like that unless it was serious .
Another Saftey mishap is the  way to the doors / exit having no gate. The idea of parks like these are for parents to relax a little and not have to be so hypervigilant of their kids escaping out a door. Every park I’ve ever been to, there was ALWAYS a gate for entering and exiting the area. Several times I had to run after my son who didn’t see me sitting there at glance and thought I was in the bathrooms so he just easily walked right down the stairs, right where the exit door is to the street. I had to be so extra vigilant. I feel like there must be some sort of policy at these places for gates leading to exits. There are very small kids here too and it’s SO busy and chaotic you could loose track of your kid easily .
They don’t enforce trampoline rules like at other parks. My son just came to me saying a boy tackled him and my son was limping on one of his legs (my son is not one to want to stop the play and even ignored the bloody lip , this is the first time we’ve been to a play center and seen so many injuries from him and other kids ). Everyone just runs around crazy …
There needs to be more seating when it’s this busy and at least two watchers for the trampoline part ( or age separated parts ) and a seperate watcher for the dodgeball or I don’t consider it safe …

Review: We were excited to put to use the gift membership for Altitude.  So my son and I headed out today close to opening around 10:40, they open at 10.  New unpublished and unprinted policy that no gift cards or MEMBERSHIPS would be honored before Noon.  So they've been paid and are not honoring service agreements.  Further, the gutless owners/managers leave young people to have to tell paying guests they have to pay again.  It's wrong and they deserve to be shamed and penalized as best we all can.  Don't be scumbags Altitude.

Review: I came with my child and my 80-year-old grandmother came with me. We come here all the time. I was told that I had to wait 10 minutes because it was impossible to do a check-in because the hall was full. I asked if my grandmother could sit on a chair, I was refused in a rude manner. We stood and waited, then I was told that I had to wait another 30 minutes, but other visitors were given bracelets and did not interfere with them entering the hall, but we were not even given a chair. When I asked at the reception why my grandmother could not sit, but all the others were already jumping on the trampolines that were after us, despite the hall being full. And these visitors are not guests at the birthday party.

Review: I just had my daughter's birthday party here and was very disappointed. I paid for the most expensive package. Someone introduced themselves as our host but then never came back again. I never even got water for the kids jumping around (supposed to be included). Luckily I had brought some for the adults. We were supposed to get icees with our package; they never came. We were supposed to get party favors for jump time for our guests and didn't receive that or the t-shirt. For the price that I paid, I was very disappointed and should receive a refund in the amount of the package I paid for and the package that I received. I contacted them through their website 5 days ago in an effort to make this right before posting a negative review but I never heard back from anyone.

Review: This was my first visit to this location. I've heard a lot about the trampoline park and have seen many videos of it.

The place was extremely crowded and busy. Unfortunately with the crowds came the mess. There was some staff available to clean up after each party in the rooms. However, the continuous mess around the hallway and seating area was not cleaned up.

Each of the parties get their own room, along with pizzas and water bottles. Bottles. The parties can bring their own decorations, goodie bags, cakes, etc. those who are participating in the trampoline activities are given special socks to use on the trampoline. Along the trampolines were some seating area as well as some fancy massaging chairs (not free).

It seemed like all the kids are having a blast which is what matters in the end!

Review: Just had my son’s birthday party there tonight and will never go back! The only reason I am even giving this place a 1 is because the kids had a good time.
Cleanliness- gross, smells bad
Food- only option was pizza and their pizza is Gross!
Overall condition of park- run down and not safe! There was a huge hole in one of the trampolines which to me poses a huge safety issue. They also replaced their foam pit with a launching pad that collapsed with my son and friends inside of it. Their “fix” for both problems was duct tape.
Service - absolute zero and I’d NEVER recommend holding a party here. Got there 15 mins before the start of our party to set up (was told to arrive 15 mins early). There was another party going on in the room and didn’t get in until our party started. Our party host was nowhere to be found. There was only 1 person working the front desk so while there was an “expedited” line for party check ins- guests sat there waiting in regular line. I had to ask if someone could come help check in my guests that sat in line for 10-15 minutes which ate into their jump time. Then they weren’t telling the guests which party room to go to, forgot to give half of them socks so they had to go get back in line.  About 20 minutes into our party- our party host showed up to introduced herself and confirmed our food order. The parties are supposed to be an hour of play of play time, hour in party room.  An hour and 15 minutes after our party started and we hadn’t been called to our room for food- I started wondering if they forgot us. Go to the front desk to ask what time the pizza is going to be served for our party and was told I’d have to ask our host- to which I said- well where is she? The kids started filtering into the party room on their own out of hunger and being thirsty and the party host happened to be bringing pizza in.  I asked her, did you announce for his party to come back here? Nope.  So I asked if she could do that. The party host did not assist at all. My guests were helping pass out pizza and drinks. Usually at these places the party host cuts and passes out the cake. Nope me, my husband, and another mom took care of this. Now the party has ended. No party host in sight. Go to the front desk and ask if I need to check out and sign anything or do they just charge any balance to my card on file - complete check out and final payment at front desk. Then we literally broke down everything, packed it all up on our own and rolled it out to our car. We were unloading into our car when the party host came out to the parking lot asking if we needed our check to pay our bill. Nope- we did that 20 minutes ago through the front desk while you were nowhere to be found.
This is the worst experience I’ve had at these party venues and we will never be back even just for playtime.

Review: We had a ton of fun here. Two adults with one of our sons and a niece, we all purchased socks and I think my husband and I had just as much fun jumping and playing dodgeball as the kids. Bathrooms were, well, typical. To be expected for a large indoor play space - all in all we would go back.

Review: Brought my kids here at 7:15 pm. They close at 8 pm. I wanted them to play for 45
Mins. Their staff won’t let me pay for an hour and pay for 45 mins. They pretty much said we can’t come in unless we are members.  We wanted to sign up but they also said we can’t. If I want to pay for an hour and let my kids play for 5 mins, that should be okay. We will be taking our business elsewhere. We used to come here multiple times a month.

Review: We love Altitude and are monthly members here. The trampolines are so fun, and their new jumping pad in place of the foam pit is really really fun. We love the dodgeball and basketball areas as well. Cleanliness is a concern, as it is with a lot of indoor play places, and the overall park is a bit run down, but management has addressed those concerns and is working on improvements. Be prepared to wash your hands frequently and well and use the hand sanitizer provided. They recently added in a giant landing pad in place of the foam pit, which is really fun. The dodgeball area definitely could use some more balls, since a lot of the ones there are stuck in the netting. A few of the nets and trampolines are damaged, with quick fixes like zip ties and duct tape, but again, I am pretty sure management is working to fix those issues, and have been communicative about any concerns! I would recommend going during the week during the work/school day if you can, (especially if you have little ones under 5) the weekends can get extremely busy and can get a little hectic for the smaller kiddos. Overall, it's a really fun way to get the energy out, for kids and adults who can jump with their kids - and is overall a really fun time!!

Review: I wanted to take the time to shoutout Altitude Trampoline Park, because I am so impressed with how much has been improved. We went a handful of times in the past but today was different! The AC was pumping full blast (in the past, I used to sweat just sitting there as the parent, lol), music was super family-friendly (Disney theme songs) and the facility was super clean (clean bathrooms, floors, and tables). I noticed all the sanitizer stations dispersed everywhere and the couple that I used worked! We are doing their monthly membership for my four kids and plan to be back multiple times every week now.

Review: Decent place to take toddlers when it’s raining out. There should be a closed door to the opening of the second floor in case a toddler wanders off from a slide or goes behind the sides and down the stairs. Also a bit odd adults can’t go into the slides to help their children out if needed. A ball pit would be a great addition.

I asked if it was 3 already and she was a little rude, but after talking to her staff she did stay open and allowed us to come in and use the play land area and arcade. I wish we could have experienced the kitchen. It looked so cute in there.
By the end of us checking in, the owner was more pleasant. Making sure we knew she was closing at 3 on the dot..

Review: Amazing. Really exceeded our expectations. Only $10 for our 2yr old toddler and both me and my feonce. We didn't get food but it was reasonable prices too. A kids meal of either hotdog, chicken nuggets, or nachos with popcorn and a slushy would have only been $3.25😊 they had a toddler area full of different toys and play stations. There was Soo much our little guy didn't know what he wanted to play with and had a blast. There was a little slide perfect for him with cushion at the bottom and he went down it so many times he started laying down after the 20th time because he was played out. We were only there for 2hours because he got played out and it was well worth it. We could have been there for 5 hrs as their hours are 10am-3pm. We are taking our little guy and my little 4 yr old brother back next weekend since it was such a success 😊 definitely check it out if you get the chance.

Review: I have been here a few times now with my 3 year old, and he has a great time. There are a ton of activities for him to play with, from traditional playroom type toys, puzzles, play kitchens/stores, and so on. The main attraction is the castle 'playground' made up of tunnels, slides, climbing walls, and passageways. They also have a small arcade downstairs, and one of those virtual projector stepping things with lots of games. On top of all that they serve food such as pizza, hotdogs and slushies. Last night they hosted a Christmas party for parents and kids which included pizza snacks and drinks, as well as a  gingerbread craft for everyone to do! Definitely recommend bringing your kids here.

Review: We were passing through on a road trip with our 2yo and 3yo, and needed a place for them to wiggle for a couple hours. This was perfect! The kids bounced in the bounce house to their hearts' content, chugged around the train table, tried out everything in the toddler area, enjoyed the virtual play area, and played on the lower parts of the gigantic play structure. The worst part was getting them to leave!

Facility was pretty clean (though parts smelled a bit like cleaner, which I don't love),  friendly staff, eating options (basics like pizza and hot dogs), cute bathrooms... It's in an old church, which adds to the charm and the castle look. Play structure is very impressive. A lot of the other toys are things probably donated or found on Craigslist, but all quality and our kids sure enjoyed them. For $12 for the whole family, it was well worth the stop.

Review: Under staffed. No one watching play area,  I only stayed 90 mins and 30 of that was letting them eat and play games.  I was not offered a refund or a pass for my children to return at another time when it would be safe.
Older children where running playing tag pushing each other, hiding in the 3 and under area where my two children were playing.  The adults that were with them were to busy on there phone and talking and running themselves to do anything about the older children.  We will not return nor will I recommend that place to anyone

Review: No words to explain how awesome this place is. My 20 month old loves it so much. Sometimes as a mom you can lose yourself to being just a mom, but chasing my little one through the jungle gym really brought back my childhood and the child in me. Reminded me of the 90's when you had parties at a pizza place and you could run off and play or do arcades. It's very organized and clean. The staff are friendly and it's very safe. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially a mom that needs to get out and socialize. Food is delicious!

Review: I love Cabin Fever and every thing the bring to the community. They took the stress out of the entire party, and all of the kids had a great time.  I cant recommend them enough.

We had my daughters Birthday Party there and Richard and Malachi greated us, offered a cart  helped bring in everything for the party.  We had dropped off decorations and the team had the party room all set.  They did a great job.  They played out how they suggested the event played out (play first, food, Birthday then game room).  We had 13 kids of different re at ages and they all loved the different areas in the play room.  The sensory quiet room was a big hit as well.  My kids came full of energy and left tired.  Win win!!!

When they made an announcement the the food was ready, the team swept in and quickly got the kids food, we sang and the team was able to distribute cake in an orderly fashioned in no time.

It was a smooth transition to the game room. They passed them out right before tidying up the room.    They recently got some new games for all kids ( and myself) of all ages.

Clean up was a breeze all we had to do was get the leftovers and gifts to the car.  Easy Peasy and the kids had a blast.  5 start great place for a kids to have fun and get out some excess energy.

I cant thank the entire team at Cabin Fever for a great experience.  Thank you so much!!!

Review: Our granddaughter was visiting from out of town and of course it was hot and so humid; so we needed to find a place we could take a two year old to enjoy playing.
Well, we hit the jackpot with Cabin Fever Play Center.  It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites.
There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡
There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend.
What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind.
We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.  Thank you for this amazing place for children to come play and enjoy themselves.  There needs to be more of these around different cities for the children.

Review: Extremely kid friendly environment! I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often! Businesses like this one really do stand out and make a huge difference in the community!

Everyone working there is so friendly and nice, and they do whatever they can do to help you, always with a smile, have a great time, and feel comfortable. My grandson's birthday was there this past week, and everyone had a great time. They made his birthday special. Thank you Cabin Fever!!! I  definitely recommend them!

Review: Our favorite place to go when the weather was hot, cold, rainy, snowy, overcast, sunny, or cloudy. We moved last month and my daughter still talks about it daily. So much fun for my toddler from tumbling to three and my now 6-year-old said it was his favorite thing to do in Maryland. Great space for working remote while your kids play and there's something secret in the pizza. Staff is attentive and overall awesome. Surprisingly good food and drink options. Can't think of a better place to throw a kid's birthday party.

Review: I held my daughters 3rd birthday here today. Me and my family have been here one other time, and were completely SOLD. Today just sealed the deal! Everyone was so sweet and considerate from the very beginning! They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛
