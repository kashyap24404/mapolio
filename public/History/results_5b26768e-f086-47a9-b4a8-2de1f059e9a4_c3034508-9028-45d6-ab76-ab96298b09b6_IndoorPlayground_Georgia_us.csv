Review: Our 2 year old had a wonderful time playing here! It is much cleaner than the previous play space (Crayon Panda). There are many of the same toys/playsets but a brighter, cleaner feel plus some new fun toys. They also have added a gated area for 2 and under kiddos which is nice to keep them safe from bigger kids! The owners were very kind and made us feel welcomed.

Review: Peachy Pals is such a fun and convenient spot for both kids and parents! It‚Äôs super cute and thoughtfully designed. The new owner is incredibly welcoming and has really created a warm, family-friendly atmosphere.
They have a balloon station with options for special occasions like Father‚Äôs Day (as of recent), birthdays, or just because‚Ä¶ Sometimes kids just love having a balloon! There‚Äôs also a large party room available, and they offer full decorations, so all you have to do is show up and let the kids play and celebrate.
The play area includes a separate space just for children under two, and there are tables and seating for parents to relax while keeping an eye on their little ones. Let me be sure to mention that there are snacks available for the kids, which, after all that running around, they definitely work up an appetite!

Just a heads up: the play area is shoeless, so make sure to bring clean socks for you and your children!

Review: Absolutely LOVE this place! My little boys (almost 2 and 4) had the best time and didn‚Äôt want to leave! The play area is filled with a huge variety of toys and activities that kept them entertained the entire time. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of thought has gone into making the space both fun and safe for kids.

The new owners are fantastic ‚Äî warm, welcoming, and clearly passionate about creating a great experience for families. You can feel the positive energy the moment you walk in. The new flooring, fresh paint, balloon bar, and gate show that they have put their heart into making the space even better than it was before. It‚Äôs rare to find a play place that hits the mark for both kids and parents, but this one absolutely does. Highly recommend ‚Äî we can‚Äôt wait to come back!

Review: Love, love, love this place! Wonderful outlet for kiddos, the owners were so welcoming and the place felt safe and warm. The space was nice for parents as well, my kiddo was able to play and I could see him wherever he was from the table and chairs I was at, I was even able to play with him when he wanted (it‚Äôs nice the place allows for parents play too as many places I‚Äôve been to parents often don‚Äôt fit in the spaces). His favorite was the tool ‚Äúworker man‚Äù space, the big yellow slide into the ball pit and the inflatable slide. He had so much fun here we will definitely be back and plan to do his party there as well!

Review: 5 stars ‚Äì A cozy, safe place for little ones to play

Peachy Pals, which used to be Crayon Panda, has definitely kept its heart through the changes‚Äîand in some ways, it‚Äôs even better now. One thing I really appreciate is the new area just for kids 2 and under. That wasn‚Äôt available before, and as a parent, it‚Äôs such a relief to have a space designed with the littlest ones in mind.

Compared to bigger spots like Jump World, where things can feel chaotic and a little risky, Peachy Pals feels calm, clean, and safe. You can actually breathe a little while your kids play. Whether you‚Äôre sitting back with a coffee or staying engaged alongside them, it‚Äôs easy to enjoy the time together.

I‚Äôd absolutely recommend it to any parent with young kids. It‚Äôs playful, well thought out, and a nice change of pace from the loud, overcrowded places. Peachy Pals is doing it right.

Review: What a great place for those of us with younger little ones. Often times, the 8-10 year old+ kids are well covered with activities and play areas, and the littlest ones are left with a tiny area with 3 toys. Not at Peachy Pals. It‚Äôs all about the younger kids here. Tons of activities, slides, balls to play in, and more toys than Santa can stuff in his sleigh. Our boys love to play here, and we love not having to clean up after the tornados come through. It‚Äôs a win for us, and they always leave tired. Check out Peachy Pals, it‚Äôll be your new favorite place to take your little ones to play!

Review: I was so excited to see what they would do with new management from Crayon Panda. I went on the opening day and was so disappointed. The place was not even vacuumed or wiped down. It was filthy. Dust and dirt everywhere. The toys weren‚Äôt upgraded or fixed, just moved around. All the play houses and toy areas and play kitchen etc were all missing pieces. The stuffed animals in the areas are filthy as well. Not sure why it takes to reopen when it appears there really weren‚Äôt any upgrades. Doesn‚Äôt look like the place has been vacuumed, moped, or even wiped down in months at the minimum. Would rather not take my baby to a place that is so obviously unsanitary

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

Review: There are chairs and little tables, but you are not allowed to use them while your kid is playing even though you can see your child the whole time. There are no other seats for you to sit on so you were just standing there the entire time.

We were displaced during Hurricane Milton and found ourselves staying near by and were at a loss for what to do with our 21 month old until we found Wiggles and Giggles. For $10 dollars, it was the perfect activity that we ended up coming daily to help him get out his energy. Highly recommend to anyone in the area, we wish we had one by us!!

They also go around every 30 mins and straighten up so while you have quite a few kids playing it never becomes destructive.

There was absolutely nothing for her to do there. It‚Äôs for toddlers and preschoolers. So why were we charged $20 extra dollars? My grandson had a great time as it was worth the $10 for him but not happy about being charged $20 for my 9 year old daughter to sit at a table and watch. Ridiculous

They have numerous stations for kids, they even have a gated area exclusively for babies 0-12m which for me is very thoughtful of them, and the staff ensures each one is clean and organized. Also, a big thank you to the staff who helped my husband locate his misplaced phone. It wasn't their responsibility to help, but they went above and beyond, searching every station. Fortunately, he found it, and the staff even called to ensure he had it back. Thank you, Adventure Town staff!

Review: I took my five year old daughter here today and she had a blast! I definitely think it‚Äôs geared towards her age and younger. It‚Äôs a very small indoor playground, but super fun. If you‚Äôve been to a catch air it‚Äôs probably a fourth of that size. The website says 10 and under which totally makes sense, Id probably even say to go younger. I didn‚Äôt get a coffee from the cafe but I absolutely LOVE that they have that available for parents. The workers were super sweet!! This is NOT an all day pass-it‚Äôs just for two hours! It says that on the website as well, but I totally forgot and asked if we could go get lunch and re-enter, that‚Äôs a no-go!!

I took off a star because you have to take your shoes off BEFORE you enter the fun zone (makes sense) however, the two bathrooms are IN the fun zone area‚Ä¶ which means kids/adults are going into the bathroom with their socks on then playing all over the equipment in nasty bathroom socks ü§¢ that is so so unsanitary and spreads horrible germs and bacteria everywhere. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to change this, looking at the layout.
This was my only complaint, we enjoyed our time here!

Review: My kids & I have been going here for the past two years and I was so excited to see the remodel! When I took them a few weeks ago obviously I had to resign the waiver and everything which was fine! This time we had to actually pay for socks for each of us,  and I was totally okay with that. After everything was filled out and sock sizes were done she said cash or card and mind you I had my 5 year old and 2 year old by myself because my husband was working.. I politely asked how much it would be because it‚Äôs all three of us and the lady looked at me in a concerning way saying oh it‚Äôs $47 and that honestly rubbed me the wrong way. The look she gave me was oh can you afford it, and that is a hurt no mother shouldn‚Äôt ever feel trying to take her kids to play and have a good time.. The remodel is so good and you should definitely check it out but with the way I felt I‚Äôm not sure if I feel comfortable going back, but that is also just my experience. They did do a fantastic job with everything and my kids did love it!

Review: We drive over half an hour to get here regularly and have been loyal customers for years now. My 10 year and 4 year old daughters have been going to this place at least once/twice a month for years. We arrived today and were turned away since they ‚Äúchanged the ages to 8 and under at beginning of the year‚Äù but we‚Äôve never been turned away before. So apparently they just pick and choose when they want to enforce this rule, because they didn‚Äôt have a problem taking my money the last 11 months of this year. Keep in mind, we have to do waivers at least once a year, so they knew my 10 year old was not 8 or underü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è highly unprofessional to pick and choose when to enforce rules that are not even posted in store nor made known at sign up.

Review: We first went here to scope out places for our son's 2nd birthday. After walking around and seeing how clean and safe the facility was, we were sold. I was very impressed with the friendliness and follow through for his party. I got a phone call a week before to confirm everything, clarify instructions for myself and guests on the day of. I can't tell you how stress-free they attempted to make everything for me. All of our guests were impressed with the cleanliness of the facility. We were all thoroughly impressed with the fact that everything was safe enough to let them run and play, while at the same time being sturdy enough for us adults to play on it with them. We cannot wait to come back and play!

Also the party rooms are excellent for little kids to sit, and I was amazed they had a fridge in each one. The only drawback was there was not a lot of room for adults to sit in the party room, but they were fine sitting out in the tables outside the party room.

Thank you again for all your help making our special day amazing!

Review: I have not been to many indoor playgrounds, but I do return to this one often. They have equipment to entertane small babies to young teenagers. Kids can romp and play pretty freely without endangering each other. There is a Diner here within easy access of the play area. Food is at a typical expense. There is a reasonable selection of drinks, snacks and desserts.

I have had a few objections that they seem to be addressing, which is awesome. At this point, I am only concerned with one gate that the kids can easily get out of and it gets a little difficult to keep track of them when it get busy. There are play areas out of sight. Parents usually look out for each other's kids so I don't get too nervous about it. There are two separate entrances/exits. One stays locked and the other has an employee manning it the majority of the time. So I would say it is reasonably secure. But I would recommend that you keep a vigil just in case.

My three kids love it here and they range from 2 to 4 years of age. They have yet to get hurt here and they meet lots of other kids and get plenty of exercise.  They are usually worn out by the time they get in the car.

Check it out, it is worth the trip.

Review: My daughter is One years old, but because she is a few months past 12 months old I was charged a higher price and shouldn‚Äôt have been. She is One not two or a different age, according to the signs etc, one is different price. (Edited) I did let the woman know at the counter about the price and was told no Because she is not exactly one. When I‚Äôm fast my daughter is one. So let me get this straight it‚Äôs exactly 12 months? That doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. It was also over crowded for the size of the space when we went :( way too many parties at once.

Review: Cost is ridiculously high for what they have to offer. $17 for one child.  They expanded but didn't add anything new. Food is outrageous as well. 2 tiny bags of chips and 2 generic bottles of water almost $7.  Not a wallet friendly place. Younger kids can have fun. Not set up for older children.

Review: I had my child‚Äôs birthday party here and although the kids all had fun there definitely some things that need to be worked on. Other than our ‚Äòparty host‚Äô the staff could not be bothered to do their jobs. I stood at the front for a solid 90 seconds before the two employees looked up from their phone and their knitting/yarn. Even at the cafe all 3 employees were sitting down faces glued to their phones/ipads attached to the wall by their power cords.
Also the bathrooms could definitely use some maintenance or TLC. For being a children‚Äôs place you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have stools at the toilets to help the kids potty or more diaper changing areas. It would also help to have a few several air fresheners because they smelled terrible.
I see from other reviews others have made these exact same comments. So why not educate your staff on customer service and paying attention to the guests. I didn‚Äôt see a single staff member walking around cleaning or sanitizing a single thing the entire 4hrs I was there.
I do have to say all kids had a great time running around and playing together, but there is definitely some management/training things that need to get worked on if they want to compete with the Catch Airs and Little Gyms.

Review: Fun place for the kids, we take ours there often. Would be 5 stars, but‚Ä¶

The party room rental is a disaster. To start, you are charged an extra $10 reservation fee and are not told about it until after you are charged. No mention of this fee on the website, only in an email after you make your deposit.

On our visit, our pizza was 45 minutes late and we had to rush the kids to eat since our time was almost up. Pizza was undercooked. Staff had an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude.

We won‚Äôt return, even for the fun playground, because of the party room experience.

Review: Disappointed at the facilities. Bathrooms were really dirty. Playmats where children play were filthy. Three staff behind the cafe and all of them were on their iPads, phones with headphones on not even looking up to see people in line waiting to be helped. Terrible attitude prevented me from wanting to even order anything. The under 2 play area was full of much older kids and staff was nowhere to be found. Nothing against having teenagers work in a place but if that's how they're going to run a business, with apathy and bad attitude, I'm out. All you have to do is check your cameras and see what I mean.

Review: We had such a fantastic time at DinoDash Indoor Playground! This place is an absolute gem for families with young kids. The facilities are super clean, safe, and well-maintained. My little one was absolutely thrilled by all the fun activities ‚Äì from the giant play structures to the interactive games.

What really stands out is how well-organized everything is. The staff are friendly, attentive, and always ready to help, making the experience stress-free for parents. There‚Äôs also a dedicated toddler area which was perfect for my younger child to safely explore while the older kids had fun in the larger play zones.

They offer plenty of seating for parents, free Wi-Fi, and even a small cafe for a quick snack or coffee while watching the kids play. It's clear that DinoDash really prioritizes both fun and safety, and it's a great place for kids to burn off energy in a safe, clean environment.

Highly recommend this place for any family looking for a fun and engaging indoor play space. We'll definitely be back!

Our allergic child was excited to be included and loved the pizza! The birthday boy had the time of his life and was absolutely devastated when the party was over. The entire [huge] facility was much cleaner than I expected a children‚Äôs play place to be, and the staff went above and beyond to make the whole thing easy for mom and dad. My son has already requested that next year‚Äôs party be held at Dino Dash. He also wishes birthdays weren‚Äôt so far apart so that his next Dino Dash party could be sooner.

She seems to be pretty young ( maybe Latina ) I don‚Äôt understand why work in a kids environment if you‚Äôre not happy ? I would give it a 5 stars but her attitude stinks and changes the mood of the customers being taken cared of. You go up to order something and she doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge that you‚Äôre there.

I know it's your job but we can be nicer when it comes to asking for the event room. Not only should you be nice before renting. You have to be nice even if the payment has already been made.

Review: The girls working here don‚Äôt seem to like their jobs much. They sat on their phones for hours behind the counter. They were eating behind the food counter and I watched two of them lick their fingers and then serve food and drinks without washing their hands. Super gross.

Review: This indoor playground is ok. It‚Äôs pretty small if you‚Äôd ask me. I definitely feel like older kids should be taught to be around younger ones. Every time I come here with my toddler, the older kids are always pushing each other around and just so rough. The cafe area sucks, the wait time is around 20 min for a slice of pizza. I order a slice and they burned it and didn‚Äôt offer to make a new one.

Review: 5+ stars for The Funville Factory! A lovely venue. Safe, clean, and the perfect place to host your child's birthday party. We did my daughter's 4th birthday there this past weekend and everything was perfect. Jen (the owner) is awesome. So sweet, reliable and responsive. She wants everything to be easy and perfect for you as the busy parent. The rest of her staff is also so beyond sweet. Everyone had a BLAST! Also, the pizza they get from next store is really yummy (antico style) not just ""regular pizza."" The type of play stuff they have is really good for ranges of ages so my daughter and most of her friends are 4 but there were siblings there older and younger that all had things to be occupied with. We did the 3 hour galaxy package to have the place to ourselves, so worth it. 3 hours of play time is VERY generous!! Overall 10/10 experience. Wouldn't change a thing!!<3<3<3<3

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs fourth birthday at Funville Factory and it could not have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived, the owners were right there welcoming us and helping set everything up, making sure we had everything we needed. They even accommodated us with juice boxes, the cutest Super Kitties themed plates, and a pile of stickers that the kids went crazy over.

The place itself is a little smaller than some of the bigger indoor playgrounds, but honestly that was a huge plus. There was so much variety packed into the space with swings, slides, pretend houses, and climbing areas, and because it was cozy, it was easy to keep an eye on all the kids without feeling overwhelmed. The owners were constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy and calmly stepping in if two kids looked like they might get into a squabble. It felt so safe and thoughtfully run.

The party room looked amazing when we walked in, like a mini Super Kitties world made just for our daughter. They paid attention to every little detail, making sure every child had a seat, plenty of juice, and a stack of stickers to take home. It made the whole party feel really special and personal.

Funville Factory is perfect for younger kids, especially around two to six years old. It seems like they do not really accept kids older than six, which honestly makes sense because the space is so perfectly tailored for the little ones. If you have a four-year-old like we do, this place feels like a dream.

What really stood out the most was how personally involved the owners were the entire time. They were not just running the place, they were making sure our daughter and all her friends were having the best time. We could not have asked for a better experience and we will definitely be back.

Review: I‚Äôm a nanny for two sweet little girls ages 1 and 2 . I originally was going to have a friend with me to help take the girls to a park or something because it‚Äôs hard to take them places by myself. Our plans fell through but I really wanted the girls to have an adventure. So I searched indoor places and stumbled upon this place! So We went Last Friday in the evening and at first I was hesitant with the prices but I decided to give them a shot! And I‚Äôm sooo glad I did!! The pricing makes so much sense once you are in there! They have lots of toys and jungle gym type things for toddlers to play on! It‚Äôs super clean in there, even with it being a place for toddlers the germs are always everywhere. But the staff was frequently cleaning and watching over the kids so the parents or nanny ,like my self , can feel at ease and not have to be a Helicopter. MAJOR PLUS! They also have these cute slippers that you wear to go to the restrooms so your feet aren‚Äôt touching the bathroom floor! Lastly in the front they have snacks, more toys and gagets for the kids either free or a low price! Overall, me and the girls will Definitely be back! And thank you Funville for making our experience peaceful and fun!

This is a small business and the owner is super kind and personable. She really does enjoy children. The place is very clean. They sanitize constantly. My daughter never gets sick from here like other indoor play areas. It‚Äôs a great place to come anytime but it has been a life saver during cold rainy weather as well. They do parents night out which has been amazing. My daughter will not go to anyone but she will go to the owner at Funville. They also have lots of special events such as reading or arts and crafts. I highly recommend this place for just playing and for birthday parties. It was one of the best parties we held.

Review: I‚Äôve been going to Funville for a while now and I have to say this is the best place in town for young kids. I had a really hard time finding an age appropriate playspace that catered to toddlers.

Not only is this place suited for kids under 6, the staff does an incredible job of keeping the place clean and organized. An impressive feat with a bunch of 1&2 year olds running around.

I also had the chance to speak with the owner, and she takes cleanliness, safety, and overall experience very seriously while being incredibly personable.

I highly recommend Funville for any parents wanting a safe, fun place for their little!

Review: Funville factory is a cute little play place. It is tailed more for early elementary aged kids but a new mom friend and I met there to take our 8 month olds and it was still fun little things there for them to do. The staff members are really nice and the environment is SUPER clean. I love that they make you remove your shoes and have a designated bathroom area with provided slippers to go to the bathroom. It‚Äôs such a cute little area and they even do birth celebrations. Definitely recommend parents taking their kids if you‚Äôre looking.

Review: This place seems like a lot of fun for kids, has lots to play with, is clean and well-maintained, and has reasonable prices.

However, the two times I‚Äôve been there‚Äìweekday afternoons‚Äìit‚Äôs been uncomfortably crowded. They also have a fair bit of clutter from the toy kitchen, puzzles, train station, etc. that ends up littering the whole area.

Between the overcrowding and the clutter, my one-year-old was terribly overstimulated after an hour and a half each time we visited. He had trouble falling asleep‚Äìwent to bed well over an hour late‚Äìafter both of our visits. We get out and about doing toddler things most days and that‚Äôs never happened anywhere else, so for me that really highlights how overstimulating it is here.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun place for lots of kids, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a great environment for mine.

Review: This is the nicest indoor playground we found in the Atlanta area. I frequent quite a few of these with my 2 yo on rainy days and birth parties. I couldn't even have imagined one could be so nice until a friend brought me here. The colors are pastel and soothing, they play classical music, and the staff wipes down and tidies constantly throughout all the stations. They have stations for fine motor and gross motor skills. You just don't see overstimulated children, like the other ones. I love this place and will continue driving here from Brookhaven. The owner is really awesome too! My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves

Review: We stumbled across Funville earlier this summer (thank you OTP Mama for the tip!) It quickly became a favorite play spot for our toddler and was a life savor for us on those grueling hot summer days.

The place is AMAZING - with all sorts of toys/sensory exploration/playground fun you need to keep a toddler (or crew of toddlers!) entertained for hours on end. They also offer various packages - that you can take advantage of through their membership OR NOT. (I personally appreciate that flexibility in a membership/subscription dominant world) Of course they have birthday party packages, and we just hosted our son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect - but it was an amazing day that went off without a hitch. The owner, Jen, went above and beyond with the decorations. All I had to do was share the number of attendees and theme, and she took care of the rest (‚Ä¶and had it decorated better than I ever could have!!) Jen‚Äôs professionalism - which permeates through her entire staff - is top notch and the Funville team‚Äôs customer service makes party day enjoyable for everyone (parents too!). The pizza that‚Äôs included as part of the birthday package is delicious - and also happens to be right next store, in case you need to add on any last minute additions. (Have I mentioned the convenience of this experience??) My husband and I were carefree from start to finish and it really changed the entire day for us - it was totally worth it. They also took care of the gift bags AND had a special gift for the birthday boy.

THANK YOU Jen and the Funville Factory team for making this such a wonderful day - and planning experience - for my family! I absolutely recommend this place for anyone with kiddos (toddlers are the sweet spot, but I feel like kids up to 7 or 8 would also have a ball). And if you‚Äôre looking for a fun space for your next event, and a professional/customer-focused staff to help you execute, you‚Äôve found your spot!

Review: Funville was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. I purchased the private event package, and the place was closed to the public for a couple of hours. My daughter could enjoy the place comfortably with her friends, and I could relax and enjoy talking to my family and friends without worrying about cleaning, serving food, or setting up the decorations. The staff did a wonderful job with the decorations and setting up the tables. My daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse-themed birthday, so the staff decorated the party room according to that theme and even had Minnie Mouse plates and utensils for the cake. They also provided goodie bags for all my daughter‚Äôs friends. My friend told me how much her two kids loved what was in the good bags. My daughter also received a Funville T-shirt, a Mickey Mouse puzzle, and a lollipop.

Also, the package includes Napoli pizzas (the pizza place is next to Funville) for your guests. This was the first time I had Napoli pizza, and I fell in love with its fresh ingredients and overall flavor! Most of my guests had their pizza for the first time and are planning a separate trip to Funville and Napoli Pizza.

Another reason to have your toddler celebrate their birthday at Funville is that parents do not have to chase after their toddler. This is because Funville is a small space, but it is packed with interactive and fun activities that will keep them occupied. It is also clean and well-maintained thanks to the staff who ensure everything is in order. I could catch up on conversations with parents and enjoy myself while knowing my daughter is playing safely with other kids.

I highly recommend this event space! Thanks, Funville!

Review: Hi Valerie,

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize if our pricing felt too high for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our pricing:

	‚Ä¢	$1 for adults: We strive to keep our prices affordable. Many indoor playgrounds charge around $4.99 for adults, or even the same amount as for children. For comparison, our family recently visited the Peppa Pig Theme Park, which charged $70 for adults despite there being no rides for adults. (It was super fun to watch our kids having a BLAST!)
	‚Ä¢	$4 for children 8 months and younger: But they play for FREE WITH A PAYING SIBLING!
	‚Ä¢	$10 for children aged 9 to 21 months: Our playground is specially designed for this age group, with plenty of toys and activities tailored to their needs.
	‚Ä¢	$16 for children aged 22 months and up: We carefully researched our pricing and can assure you that our prices are among the most competitive in Georgia.

Regarding cleanliness, I can assure you that we take this very seriously. We clean and disinfect regularly throughout the day, even if it may not always be visible. We understand that while you‚Äôre focused on watching your child, it might be easy to miss our team in action. Additionally, we don‚Äôt mop the floors during business hours to avoid soaking your socks or causing slips and falls, which is why we require socks to be worn. We are also moving our shoe rack outside the entrance to help keep socks clean and ensure a better experience for everyone.

We appreciate your input and hope to welcome you back soon.

Review: This place is a safety hazard‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è In the 1-3 toddler section, there are metal poles sticking up from the ground that they wrapped in pool noodles(with the top exposed for a child to put their hand in). The foam mats are bulging (my child tripped over the bulge twice), and have gaps in between each other. The kitchen lights were off you couldn‚Äôt even tell it was open. When you walk in, you take your shoes off and head to the person at the desk. You write your child‚Äôs name down in their log book. There isn‚Äôt a sign displayed or an injury liability waiver you sign saying ‚Äúthe owners or operators of the playground are not legally liable for any injuries that occur while using the equipment‚Äù. Paying $9 for a potential trip to the hospital isn‚Äôt worth it to me. They play Caribbean music and nothing else. This is a kids place they should play kid friendly music.

Pro: Unlimited playtime for $9. The play areas were clean.

Review: This place is very unsafe. The mats around the trampolines are not tied down so small children can fall through. One of the trampolines even has a hole in it so a small child's foot can go through. When climbing up the hills to the big slides, the padding does not go from wall to wall. My friends 16 month son almost fell through the cracks which untimely ended our play time early there. Also a lot of the features on the attractions were broken or blocked off, my 12 year old was pretty upset about that. I will say for the most part they keep the place pretty clean, there is a person that walks round and makes sure toys are put back and organized and cleans up after each person sits at a table to eat. My 12 month daughter loves it of course so we'll be going back but under very close supervision because as I said, the place is very unsafe. 0 safety stars.

Review: This place is great as far as taking your kids to have fun. There‚Äôs a lot of space to run around and it‚Äôs nice not having to sit out in the heat. There are tables off to the side for people to sit & eat. The kids always enjoy running around here, & it‚Äôs only $11 per child, for unlimited time, so that‚Äôs an amazing price.

The only reason this place gets 3 out of 5 stars today is because my mom ordered food. She ordered a wings combo & 2 large fries on the side. The wings combo was made very quickly, but they forgot the 2 sides of fries. When I asked about them, they said they‚Äôd be ready soon. Maybe ten minutes later, I was told it‚Äôd be another 10 minutes‚Ä¶ It took them 40 minutes to begin making the fries & the lady‚Äôs reason was that she didn‚Äôt see it because the boy who took the order wrote it too small‚Ä¶. Absolutely ridiculous.

Then to top it off, I asked the boy at the front for more napkins at some point and he literally handed me ONE.

So, great place for the kids to play, but food service is definitely not their expertise.

They have plenty of space for children to run and play even a little baby area. They are very strict regarding the no shoe policy...you must have socks to enter the play area..some minor issues but for the price I would do it again.

Review: My husband and I booked this venue for our son‚Äôs first birthday party. However, 2 weeks before the event, we visited the venue just to orient ourselves with the area and facility. Upon arrival, we were mortified by the poor maintenance of the store front (view image). We booked the venue based on the images on the website (lesson learned). We had not seen the venue in person until this day. We continued to enter the building, but with hesitation. We were pleasantly surprised by the manager‚Äôs warm welcome and she gave us facility tour. The inside looks much better than the outside, but the party rooms are dated and needs work.
After the tour, we decided to go with another venue that is better maintained in Sandy Springs. The manager provided a refund of our deposit without hesitation.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this spot to anyone who prefers an aesthetically pleasing and modern feel, but I‚Äôd recommend for a random drop-in hour of play.

Review: I wish I could give 0 stars. Don't waste your time or money. The guy at the front desk tried to sell me dirty socks, the one area where my toddler can climb the safety net had holes and the plastic zipper was poking out. Some foam mats were not placed correctly and mats were lifted up which can cause anyone to trip
My main issue was I couldn't assist my 1yo on any equipment. All she could do was climb up the little bridge because she needed help to go down the slide. They have a sign that says 13yr or older cannot use equipment
So the little slides that are near the toddler area you have the audacity to have big kids there when the big kids already have at least 4 slides to choose from. The big kids are running all in the toddler area knocking down the blocks and being wild. The toddler area should be seperated better than this, it should be gated appropriately to protect the toddlers. The music was inappropriate and filthy. I do not recommend this place. Protect your kids and go to a safer place so they can truly enjoy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE.

Review: I used to love this place. Went yesterday & the customer service was terrible. Very much nonchalant personalities from the staff. I believe they are under new management or something because most of the staff seemed like the were related. They were also dressed in regular clothes so you couldn‚Äôt tell who actually worked there. The staff needs to do better with customer service because I did not feel welcomed as a customer at all. Overall, this is a decent place to to take your kids. The place could be a tad cleaner & organized but my main concern was the terrible customer service.

Review: I MUST rate them a 5! The staff is friendly and my grandson didn't want to leave after two hours. That's saying a LOT because it is monumentally difficult to hold his attention. The biggest draw for me is... THERE ARE NO VIDEO GAMES. The fact that he is now so interested in indoor play and making friends is a happy development. Children 4 to12 should love it here. The babies under three or four years need very close supervision  because the baby section is cordoned off in the middle of the floor, and the older children routinely jump over the dividers and run through.}","Georgia","kidslandga.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","30236"

They frequently have new toys and activities so it never gets boring. Its perfect for a play date because you can actually sit and enjoy conversation without having to chase after the kids.

We had to scramble to find an indoor venue for our 2-year-old's birthday party at the last minute due to unexpected bad weather, and they were incredibly accommodating. The play area was clean, safe, and perfect for little ones. The kids had a blast!

A huge shoutout to Teresa, who went above and beyond, her service and support were exceptional. She was friendly, efficient, and made the entire process stress-free. We truly appreciate her dedication to ensuring our party was a success.

We highly recommend Dreamy Cloud for anyone looking for a fun, indoor playplace, especially for birthday parties. We'll definitely be back!

From the first time I reached out to get information about booking a party to the morning of communication was amazing! They always made sure I was up to date with what was going on and what I needed to know prior to party day!

The day of the party they were beyond helpful making sure we had everything we needed and they even offered to help unload my car! They helped keep the pace of the party so everything was timed out perfectly!

My daughter and her friends had the absolute best time and she has asked me every day since when we can go back there to play!!

The set up in the main area worked perfect for the amount of guest they allow, the party price was amazing, and I loved that they gave us a checklist of expectations cleaning up, and the owner was really helpful with any questions we had leading up to and during the party. We will definitely be back to play here. My son didn‚Äôt even want to stop playing for cake so that says a lot. The only negative thing I could say is it be nice to have a broom along with the vacuum for clean up and an extra trash bag would have been helpful but overall this was an amazing experience and totally worth it.

Review: In response to Curt Digla & Nordrissa Lewis:
I completely disagree with this review, as my experiences at this venue have always and consistently been the complete opposite. It‚Äôs clear that the reviewer had a frustrating visit, but many of their complaints seem exaggerated or based on misunderstandings.
First, calling this place a ""glorified daycare"" is unfair. It‚Äôs an indoor entertainment space designed for kids to have fun in a safe and engaging environment. The bounce houses, attractions, and activities are exactly what one would expect from a family-friendly venue.
It makes perfect business sense for certain attractions to be available only on specific days to encourage visits during slower periods (i.e. Wednesday)‚Äîthis is a common business strategy, not an attempt to deceive customers.
Regarding pricing, hosting a party at any entertainment venue comes with costs, and $416 for a birthday party that includes a dedicated space, play areas, and food is actually quite reasonable compared to similar venues. Pizza and Capri Suns are standard party offerings, and expecting gourmet options at this price point is unrealistic.
As for the cake, I don‚Äôt know of a single venue that includes cakes as part of the package‚Äîoutside cakes are clearly allowed, so all it takes is asking. However, last-minute issues can happen anywhere, and instead of escalating frustration, a simple check with staff could have clarified the situation.
The owners and their family members are PHENOMENAL, and their staff is professional. If a child was asked to remove a wristband, I have no doubt it was handled appropriately. The accusation of racial favoritism is not only unfair but also unfounded‚ÄîTHIS BUSINESS DOES NOT OPERATE ON RACIAL BIAS.
Additionally, the claim that the venue fabricates positive reviews is simply false.
Comparing this experience to renting a bounce house at home completely ignores the fact that not everyone has the space, time, or desire to host a party themselves. Many parents appreciate the convenience of an all-in-one venue where they don‚Äôt have to worry about setup, cleanup, or keeping kids entertained.
This review is overly negative and fails to recognize the value this venue provides. My personal experience, as well as that of many others, has been overwhelmingly positive.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VENUE TO PARENTS‚ÄîIT IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST, FRIENDLIEST INDOOR PLAY AREAS WE HAVE EVER TAKEN OUR LITTLE ONE TO. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Review: I was here yesterday at my cousins 2nd birthday party and I had a bad experience I completely agree with Niva and Curt, when having a child micromanaging other kids and snatching their wristband off is very unprofessional not only that the male owner comes to a party to try and check someone about a bad review is unprofessional and unreal. The prices are too high for it to be a daycare center with 2 bouncy houses. 30$ to do nothing is insane. Then for you to use the same paint brushes for each child face like Covid and other things not going around is crazy. I rate this place a 0/10 I will never send my worst enemy there.

The building accommodates the amount of bounce houses that it can according to its size, no false advertising at all. If someone is looking for more they could have simply driven an hour away to find one. No need to tear down an awesome business. It‚Äôs clean on the inside and many staff around to keep it that way and to offer any help. I personally will come back to this business with awesome owners and I‚Äôm glad that they have brought an indoor playground here to Conyers as it was greatly needed and appreciated.

We went for a 2 year old party and my small children had a blast. Great customer service and friendly. The owners and the rest of the staff were so hands on. We will

From the planning for the event, to the actual party, the staff were on point. The atmosphere was great, the place was clean, and there was more than enough activities to keep about twenty 6-7 year olds entertained. The kids and adults had a wonderful time thanks to the staff‚Äôs amazing dedication. I highly recommend this place.

Review: We came here as part of a birthday party and had a nice time! We were greeted warmly, and the facility was immaculately clean which started things off perfectly. They have a couple different bounce houses, an infant/small toddler area, an obstacle course, and two different sensory rooms. This would be an excellent rainy day spot to take a family, especially if you have infants and school-aged kiddos.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a five star review is because the venue itself isn‚Äôt great at noise dampening and with the motors from the inflatables, it‚Äôs very loud even before there are kids running and playing. Overall, if we lived closer we‚Äôd absolutely be frequenting here!

Review: I can‚Äôt rave about Eve‚Äôs Garden enough!!! I took my daughter to this establishment for the very first time, and she had an absolute blast!!! I was extremely impressed and pleased when I called in and spoke with the owner. Her name is Scherika (I‚Äôll come back and confirm if I spelled her name correctly). She was so nice, pleasant, down to earth and professional all at once. When we arrived, my child was the only guest there, but the owner assured me that she would have someone to play with in no time, as her children were just finishing their studies. We received a first visit discount, but even without the discount, it‚Äôs still very reasonably priced. She and her children were so sweet and attentive to my daughter. She also has massage chairs for the parents (better than the nail salon pedicure chairs). She noticed that my daughter was tugging on my hand, but I had just sat down and began the massage, so she came and got my baby, took her by the hand, and led her to yet another one of the many activities that they have to offer, so that I could finish my massage‚Ä¶ THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for that!!! I‚Äôm also happy that no shoes are allowed, so that keeps dirty shoes germs at bay. All in all, a wonderful experience!!! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back in a couple of days!!!

Review: I was searching for an indoor playroom in my area to take my nearly 20-month-old granddaughter and found Eve's Garden at the last minute when I had almost given up. I wasn't in the mood for the chaos of a trampoline park, but with the extreme heat, I knew we wanted to be indoors. From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by the safe, clean and fun environment. My granddaughter had an absolute blast, and to my surprise, my 11-year-old son enjoyed himself as well. They had air hockey, basketball, jumbo connect 4, an inflatable obstacle course, an interactive sand room and an interactive ball game room with a projector for him.

The variety of activities available kept both children entertained and busy. It took my granddaughter a little while to acclimate, but in no time, she was running around, laughing and playing! For this outing, I was specifically looking for a toddler-friendly space, ensuring she could have fun without the risk of being trampled by bigger kids. Eve's Garden perfectly fit the bill, and it was an added bonus that my son also had a great time. The music was amazing, and although we didn't partake because we had just eaten, I saw that they had a variety of snacks and drinks for purchase.

I've already recommended Eve's Garden to a dozen friends and family and can't wait to visit again when my granddaughter is back in town. The experience, staff, cleanliness and overall atmosphere were all top-notch. 10 out of 10!

My six year old had a meltdown, unlike one I had ever seen when it was time to leave. The owner helped me, made me not feel judged, and even whispered a quick prayer for my patience. I don't think she really understands how much I needed and value that! This place is really a gem!!!!

Review: We had our daughter‚Äôs second birthday party here the other weekend and it went so amazing. Everyone was so helpful, kind and eager to assist or make things easier for us. I really couldn‚Äôt say enough great things about the establishment and the family who runs it.
The thing that drew me in to this facility is how it is someplace safer and more aimed to the younger kids. Taking my toddler to a big name jump place is absolutely out of the question. They‚Äôd get trampled before getting completely through the door. At Eve‚Äôs garden, I know she‚Äôs able to run and jump and play- just living her best life and I don‚Äôt have to be in constant fear she‚Äôs going to get ran over by a big kid.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they have things aimed for the older kids, it‚Äôs not just for toddlers. My 8 year old daughter and 9 year old niece had a blast there as well! There‚Äôs a really cool obstacle course kinda thing that they had a great time with. There‚Äôs an interactive sand table that‚Äôs one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen for kids in a long time. Ok maybe not just for kids cause I did play with it too lol and there‚Äôs an air hockey table that took me back to my childhood daycare days.
Overall, this place is great. The staff is great. The environment is great. We will definitely be back to Eve‚Äôs garden indoor playground!!!
Thank you all again so much for helping us with our party. Top tier. 10/10 very much recommend!!!

As a work-from-home mom, I particularly appreciated the opportunity to get some work done while my children could play in such a comfortable and safe environment. Additionally, the sensory-friendly activities were absolutely perfect for my son who has autism.

Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful experience for my family. We are already looking forward to our next visit!

Review: Eve‚Äôs Garden was such an amazing experience for both me and my son. There are lots of entertainment activities to occupy 1 year olds while parents overlook their children. I viewed items and areas being cleaned throughout our time there and I love that there are 3-4 bathrooms (that I‚Äôve counted) on sight. Although the virtual experience with the sandbox was not available, my son still enjoyed himself playing in the sand. There was even a painting opportunity for the kids. Overall this is the place to go for a quality experience for your kids.

Review: In response to Curt Digla & Nordrissa Lewis:
I completely disagree with this review, as my experiences at this venue have always and consistently been the complete opposite. It‚Äôs clear that the reviewer had a frustrating visit, but many of their complaints seem exaggerated or based on misunderstandings.
First, calling this place a ""glorified daycare"" is unfair. It‚Äôs an indoor entertainment space designed for kids to have fun in a safe and engaging environment. The bounce houses, attractions, and activities are exactly what one would expect from a family-friendly venue.
It makes perfect business sense for certain attractions to be available only on specific days to encourage visits during slower periods (i.e. Wednesday)‚Äîthis is a common business strategy, not an attempt to deceive customers.
Regarding pricing, hosting a party at any entertainment venue comes with costs, and $416 for a birthday party that includes a dedicated space, play areas, and food is actually quite reasonable compared to similar venues. Pizza and Capri Suns are standard party offerings, and expecting gourmet options at this price point is unrealistic.
As for the cake, I don‚Äôt know of a single venue that includes cakes as part of the package‚Äîoutside cakes are clearly allowed, so all it takes is asking. However, last-minute issues can happen anywhere, and instead of escalating frustration, a simple check with staff could have clarified the situation.
The owners and their family members are PHENOMENAL, and their staff is professional. If a child was asked to remove a wristband, I have no doubt it was handled appropriately. The accusation of racial favoritism is not only unfair but also unfounded‚ÄîTHIS BUSINESS DOES NOT OPERATE ON RACIAL BIAS.
Additionally, the claim that the venue fabricates positive reviews is simply false.
Comparing this experience to renting a bounce house at home completely ignores the fact that not everyone has the space, time, or desire to host a party themselves. Many parents appreciate the convenience of an all-in-one venue where they don‚Äôt have to worry about setup, cleanup, or keeping kids entertained.
This review is overly negative and fails to recognize the value this venue provides. My personal experience, as well as that of many others, has been overwhelmingly positive.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VENUE TO PARENTS‚ÄîIT IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST, FRIENDLIEST INDOOR PLAY AREAS WE HAVE EVER TAKEN OUR LITTLE ONE TO. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Review: I‚Äôve been bringing my 3-year-old son to Eve's Garden Indoor Playground for the past five months, and I only have great things to say about the owner and staff. If you're looking for a safe, family-friendly, Christian-based environment that uplifts children and offers engaging, kid-friendly programs, this is the place to be!

Every time we visit, I can sit back and relax, knowing my son is safe and well cared for. The staff is attentive, engaging, and truly makes the experience enjoyable for both kids and parents. They also offer a variety of fun and educational programs each month, which I absolutely love! Highly

Review: I was here yesterday at my cousins 2nd birthday party and I had a bad experience I completely agree with Niva and Curt, when having a child micromanaging other kids and snatching their wristband off is very unprofessional not only that the male owner comes to a party to try and check someone about a bad review is unprofessional and unreal. The prices are too high for it to be a daycare center with 2 bouncy houses. 30$ to do nothing is insane. Then for you to use the same paint brushes for each child face like Covid and other things not going around is crazy. I rate this place a 0/10 I will never send my worst enemy there.

Review: I am here now with my nephew and daughter. They both are enjoying the experience. I hate that someone saw it necessary to post a bad review, It‚Äôs really sad. The building accommodates the amount of bounce houses that it can according to its size, no false advertising at all. If someone is looking for more they could have simply driven an hour away to find one. No need to tear down an awesome business. It‚Äôs clean on the inside and many staff around to keep it that way and to offer any help. I personally will come back to this business with awesome owners and I‚Äôm glad that they have brought an indoor playground here to Conyers as it was greatly needed and appreciated.

Review: We came here as part of a birthday party and had a nice time! We were greeted warmly, and the facility was immaculately clean which started things off perfectly. They have a couple different bounce houses, an infant/small toddler area, an obstacle course, and two different sensory rooms. This would be an excellent rainy day spot to take a family, especially if you have infants and school-aged kiddos.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a five star review is because the venue itself isn‚Äôt great at noise dampening and with the motors from the inflatables, it‚Äôs very loud even before there are kids running and playing. Overall, if we lived closer we‚Äôd absolutely be frequenting here!

Review: I can‚Äôt rave about Eve‚Äôs Garden enough!!! I took my daughter to this establishment for the very first time, and she had an absolute blast!!! I was extremely impressed and pleased when I called in and spoke with the owner. Her name is Scherika (I‚Äôll come back and confirm if I spelled her name correctly). She was so nice, pleasant, down to earth and professional all at once. When we arrived, my child was the only guest there, but the owner assured me that she would have someone to play with in no time, as her children were just finishing their studies. We received a first visit discount, but even without the discount, it‚Äôs still very reasonably priced. She and her children were so sweet and attentive to my daughter. She also has massage chairs for the parents (better than the nail salon pedicure chairs). She noticed that my daughter was tugging on my hand, but I had just sat down and began the massage, so she came and got my baby, took her by the hand, and led her to yet another one of the many activities that they have to offer, so that I could finish my massage‚Ä¶ THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for that!!! I‚Äôm also happy that no shoes are allowed, so that keeps dirty shoes germs at bay. All in all, a wonderful experience!!! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back in a couple of days!!!

Review: I was searching for an indoor playroom in my area to take my nearly 20-month-old granddaughter and found Eve's Garden at the last minute when I had almost given up. I wasn't in the mood for the chaos of a trampoline park, but with the extreme heat, I knew we wanted to be indoors. From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by the safe, clean and fun environment. My granddaughter had an absolute blast, and to my surprise, my 11-year-old son enjoyed himself as well. They had air hockey, basketball, jumbo connect 4, an inflatable obstacle course, an interactive sand room and an interactive ball game room with a projector for him.

The variety of activities available kept both children entertained and busy. It took my granddaughter a little while to acclimate, but in no time, she was running around, laughing and playing! For this outing, I was specifically looking for a toddler-friendly space, ensuring she could have fun without the risk of being trampled by bigger kids. Eve's Garden perfectly fit the bill, and it was an added bonus that my son also had a great time. The music was amazing, and although we didn't partake because we had just eaten, I saw that they had a variety of snacks and drinks for purchase.

I've already recommended Eve's Garden to a dozen friends and family and can't wait to visit again when my granddaughter is back in town. The experience, staff, cleanliness and overall atmosphere were all top-notch. 10 out of 10!

My younger one doesn't care much for inflatables, but she loved the younger kid interactive area and REALLY LOVED the interactive sand table. She actually tried an inflatable before we left and liked it.  My son loved EVERYTHING, from the inflatables to the ball wall, to the sand table, to the air hockey to basketball...like I said EVERYTHING!

My six year old had a meltdown, unlike one I had ever seen when it was time to leave. The owner helped me, made me not feel judged, and even whispered a quick prayer for my patience. I don't think she really understands how much I needed and value that! This place is really a gem!!!!

Review: Excellent play place. I'd recommend for kids under 10, plus or minus a few. Designated toddler-friendly area, bounce houses of various sizes, an obstacle course, and two computer interactive rooms. Basketball and air hockey. And I LOVE how sanitary and well maintained the facilities are. The staff members were super friendly and helpful. We'll be back!

Review: Brought my 1.5 year old here for the first time. There is a great area set up for babies/young toddlers. He also really enjoyed the sensory sand box. The owner and her daughter were so nice. My lil man is very shy and timid but the owners daughter was so sweet with him and took time to interact and play with him while he warmed up. He enjoyed himself here. I appreciate that it wasn‚Äôt super loud and chaotic like other indoor play grounds. We‚Äôll be coming back especially during the too-hot to play outside summer days.

Staff was so kind & patient with the kids. If you want a place to let the kids get out some energy in a controlled & safe environment, this is the place! My kids had a blast & didn't want to leave. Give them a try :)

Review: We had our daughter‚Äôs second birthday party here the other weekend and it went so amazing. Everyone was so helpful, kind and eager to assist or make things easier for us. I really couldn‚Äôt say enough great things about the establishment and the family who runs it.
The thing that drew me in to this facility is how it is someplace safer and more aimed to the younger kids. Taking my toddler to a big name jump place is absolutely out of the question. They‚Äôd get trampled before getting completely through the door. At Eve‚Äôs garden, I know she‚Äôs able to run and jump and play- just living her best life and I don‚Äôt have to be in constant fear she‚Äôs going to get ran over by a big kid.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they have things aimed for the older kids, it‚Äôs not just for toddlers. My 8 year old daughter and 9 year old niece had a blast there as well! There‚Äôs a really cool obstacle course kinda thing that they had a great time with. There‚Äôs an interactive sand table that‚Äôs one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen for kids in a long time. Ok maybe not just for kids cause I did play with it too lol and there‚Äôs an air hockey table that took me back to my childhood daycare days.
Overall, this place is great. The staff is great. The environment is great. We will definitely be back to Eve‚Äôs garden indoor playground!!!
Thank you all again so much for helping us with our party. Top tier. 10/10 very much recommend!!!

For ages 13 and under, they have inflatables, a basketball arcade game, ball wall room with projector, a standing sand box with projector, air hockey, large connect four, and a designated place for really little ones. They even have a spacious party room for you to have your birthday parties! The whole place, including the bathrooms, are clean and the owners and staff are super friendly and helpful.

Review: Eves Garden is a fun place for kids. My daughters had a blast playing on the inflatables, air hockey and the interactive ball wall. It is the perfect size for my youngest daughter who is 3 years old to stay entertain without being overwhelmed with too many people or kids running around. My oldest, 6 years old, could have played on the ball wall all night. They really enjoyed themselves and the owners were really friendly in making sure the girls were safe and having fun.

The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure every child felt included and safe. The activities were age-appropriate and varied enough to keep even energetic kids entertained for hours ‚Äî from interactive games to creative crafts and a fun live performance that had the whole room laughing and clapping along.

The venue was clean, spacious, and had plenty of places for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. It was clear that a lot of thought went into making this an enjoyable experience for families.

After letting them know it was my princess's birthday, they went above and beyond to make it even more special by giving her a birthday pin and bag. Mayte, Kimberly, and Yolatl were especially kind. Their customer service is top-notch. I've been to a few kids' play centers, but this one is the best. It's very clean, organized, and the prices are reasonable. It's all-day play, and you're able to leave to grab food if you want a big meal or just take a break and come back, with free re-admission.

Thank you, Kids Empire, for making my daughter's birthday one to remember.

I have a daughter who will be back there more often and my older is turning 2 next month though we‚Äôve been in that area multiple times when the bigger kids come in and kind of take it over. It‚Äôs a 50/50 problem though, parents please watch your children and make sure they are following it and employees make sure to remind parents if you see a big kid there otherwise 10/10

Those fears in hindsight seem incredibly silly because Little Leaf is so well done. He had a blast with all of his friends and it might genuinely be the highlight of his young life so far.

If you are considering visiting this place, please do because I selfishly want it to be successful so that my son can keep returning in the future!

Love that it‚Äôs not as overstimulating as other play places, and even better that it‚Äôs owned by the sweetest local family. My almost 2 year old asks to go here daily!

Review: My son LOVED this play space. We went a few weeks ago when they first opened up online scheduling! Very clean, very cute. We will definitely be back!

The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the price for birthday party rentals. We had rented out another play space earlier this year and it was $250 for 2 hours and honestly, it had way more toys/play structures. This place is $450 for 2 hours(if I remember correctly!) and the price just goes up for add ons. I understand it is located in Woodstock, but that
just seems overpriced to me.

Review: Little leaf is an amazing location for all of the young children of Woodstock! This gorgeous open play space is perfect for littles to develop their social skills and enjoy open-ended play! The space is calm and bright with plenty for the toddlers to explore and engage in without being overstimulating or making the space messy. The staff is lovely, and focus on hygiene and safety while happily engaging with the kids and parents.

My 2yo enjoyed every bit of the play room, but the slide was his favorite! I never felt like it got too croweded or loud, and I loved how you could see your kid from anywhere in the room!

Review: We absolutely loved our visit this morning for the soft opening of LLPS!! Karen was so kind and accommodating. The facility was clean but also there was an abundance and variety of toys. I could let my crawler roam freely without having to worry about him putting something in his mouth he shouldn‚Äôt. There was a great amount of space/not too crowded. I felt the noise from all the kiddos was an acceptable level. I loved that there was a baby play space, in between space, and toddler/kid space where they could all intermingle but also if you needed to be a little separate, you could also. There weren‚Äôt a ton of tables, so possibly if you need one, get there at the beginning of your time slot - not a big deal, but if you‚Äôre planning to eat and snack it could be a small issue. Overall, we loved it and cannot wait to go back. My son was so happy it was so cute seeing him explore and just the happiness of playing with new toys and kiddos!}","Georgia","littleleafplaystudio.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","30188"

Review: The Ark is such a fun and family friendly indoor playroom for children from infants to school age. The owners Savannah and Mac are always very welcoming, and the big boss Miss Josie is always a help with showing you around! They keep the areas clean and picked up, have tons of toys for different interests and rotate the toys from time to time to keep the children entertained and their brains moving. I visit quite frequently with the little ones I watch and refer other parents/caregivers here as well. If you are looking to beat the rain, summer heat or the cold winters or even just get out the house this is a good option. They also do events, allow birthday parties and offer play passes.  I love the ark and so do all the littles!

I don‚Äôt live locally anymore , so I don‚Äôt get to go as often as I‚Äôd like , but I never regret it when I make the drive to meet my girlfriends and their children.
Savannah and her team have always been kind and welcoming. I see them wiping down toys and maintaining the playroom throughout our time.
I‚Äôm a photographer and it‚Äôs the perfect spot to let my kids run around in a safe space while i get work done.
I highly recommend this spot to parents who need a coffee date , a safe indoor space on rainy days to get the kiddos out, or anyone who needs a space for birthday parties etc.

The ARK is a great space and I know the owners have a good heart and a passion for their small business!

I recently had a 5yo birthday party here and the rental was extremely easy and non stressful, in fact it was probably the easiest birthday party I've done between 2 kids in the last 8 years, I highly recommend it for birthday parties. The owner is very nice and down to earth, as well as everyone she has helping. Also if you are like me and wonder if your slightly older kid would enjoy, I've witnessed older elementary kids, including my own, having a blast. This is a great addition to the community! Thanks for a great party ü•≥

Grocery store, diner, kitchen, tools, playhouse, doctor, doll house, super hero house, and little people area. There's a nice place for parents to sit and talk. It‚Äôs large enough that the kids have plenty of room to play and have fun, but small enough where you can see the kids while they play without having to follow them around or worry about them wandering off. The kids had a great time. They played for 3 whole hours and were not bored at all.

Review: We came here this morning with friends. Had a great time. The play space was perfect for my 1 and 4 year old. Lots of pretend play toys. The place was clean too. We will be back üòÅ Note: The entrance is the white door on the side. They said are working on getting a sign on the outside.

Edit on our second visit: I love this place. This is no fault to them but the smoke shop a few door down to impacting the smell in this place. I wasn't sure what it was on our first visit but I realized that it's the smoke from that place coming into this place. So if you're sensitive like me to smoke then maybe think twice. Maybe when they're lease is up here they can move to a better location. And in the meantime maybe they can get hepa air cleaners to try to reduce the odor.

Review: I have spent some time at the Ark with my niece. The space was clean and organized. There are many stations to for children to play with others or even with their adults. She asked me to play with her and together (with me sitting on the floor) she checked me out at the ‚Äúgrocery store‚Äù then prepared a meal to us to eat. It was so much fun; my niece and I both had a blast. The kids-centered space was a perfect retreat for the hot and muggy then stormy day. The Ark also had refreshments and was an overall friendly and safe space.

I ended up booking my daughter‚Äôs birthday party there for this weekend. It is hard to find an air conditioned space that is affordable in Mcdonough but the owner was so accommodating and helpful in making sure the party would work for us!

Review: Heard about this place on a  Facebook group. I tried to take my daughter to this location earlier this week. Unfortunately, when we got there, which took a while because it is kind of off the beaten path in McDonough, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with the outside of the building. It looks like an old, run-down industrial building with a hemp store right next to it (really?) There were no cars in the front, no real signage (a taped piece of printing paper with directions to a side door ), and no curtains open to the windows so that you could at least see into the place. I  called a couple of times To see if someone was inside, but the phone kept going to voicemail (at like 11 AM) I drove around to this mysterious door and did not feel comfortable taking my daughter in so I didn‚Äôt. IMO, this is not a professional place where you take your child. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable, Didn‚Äôt like the location, and wasn‚Äôt a fan of the non-responsiveness. There were also zero cars outside, which made me think the place wasn‚Äôt even open despite their hours being listed as open from 8 to 4. I got excited about having this kind of facility, but I realize this is not what I‚Äôm looking for. I won‚Äôt be back and won‚Äôt recommend it. Hopefully, we get an actual playroom in the area sometime in the future. Until then, go North. Don't waste your time here.

It is now my 2 year old daughter's favorite place to be. She can spend hours playing independently, or play alongside other kiddos there. Just today, we brought our breakfast to eat at the playroom, and then she played for a few hours before I had to pull her away. We have been many times, and she never tires of it. It is clean, age appropriate,  and a perfect place to relax while your little ones play. Love that they have an area for nursing mamas too.

Review: Customer service is terrible at the front desk. The girl working the front desk has a smart mouth. My son is 14 and his younger brother is 6. My 14 had no intention on participating because he‚Äôs too big he was  on his laptop. She tried to charge me regular admission because he was a minor. So if he was 17 I would have to pay for him as if he was a participant because he‚Äôs a minor?
Please‚Ä¶ never heard of such. While this was being explained to me she was extremely rude. Save your money go to sky zone.

Review: ‚≠ê 1 out of 5 stars

We visited this indoor playground recently, and unfortunately, it was a very disappointing and concerning experience. The facility was noticeably dirty ‚Äî floors, equipment, and play areas all felt poorly maintained. To make matters worse, staff were mostly standing around, not engaging with kids or actively monitoring the space.

A major red flag: we found a vape on the ground inside the children‚Äôs play area. This is completely unacceptable in a space meant to be safe for young kids.

But the most upsetting part is that a few days after our visit, my daughter developed hand, foot, and mouth disease. She‚Äôs not in daycare and hasn‚Äôt been around any other children recently, so we‚Äôre confident this is where it came from. Illnesses happen, but in this case, it really feels like a direct result of a lack of proper sanitation and oversight.

This place has potential, but until they make serious improvements to cleanliness and safety standards ‚Äî and actually supervise the space ‚Äî we won‚Äôt be back.

Our granddaughters age 3 and 7 had so much fun we stayed far longer than anticipated (5 hours!) There were activities to keep  for them both happy for the whole time.

Review: A great place for all ages. We celebrated my daughter's birthday who turned one year old. While I appreciate the inclusions for the birthday party package ( drinks, fruit snack, bring your own food, 3 hr party, etc) I have some feedback/concerns:
1. Each child at the party is given ""flames"" for games and ride but they put EVERYONE'S flames on one card. A savings for the company but an inconvenience for the host and guest.
2. ""Unlimited"" drinks are 2 liters but they provide small cups. So bring your own. Another savings for the company but an inconvenience for the host and guest. Individual cans/bottles would be preferred. Especially for the water, instead of 1 gal bottle.
3.  Several older kids kept coming into the toddler area. They were fully staffed, most of them positioned behind the counter. Only one birthday party in session (mine) but no employees even attempted to regulate the toddler area.
4. I booked the morning party time (10:30am) with hopes to have first access to a clean toddler area. It was very noticeable that the surfaces/floor was not clean. Therefore in my opinion the cleanliness of the ball pit is questionable. I would have rated this place at least a 4 but had to deduct another star due to cleanliness. Cleanliness and safety should be their priority especially if they are providing a service for children.

However, the staff was friendly. Music selection was enjoyable. Thank you Bryant and Christie. They let me use an extra table for my party. Bryant was always checking on us.

Review: It was my first time coming here with my niece and my nephew who are 8 and 5 years old. It was a wonderful time from start to finish. All of the staff were so kind and helpful! The play area is a great size; not too big to lose track of your kids but not too small that they get bored fast. Lots of other kids, too, so my niece and nephew had a ton of fun socializing. The food and drinks were well-priced and the games were easy to win including the claw games. We‚Äôve been here for about 2 hours and the kids are tiring out. Well worth the time and money! Wonderful place! We will be back!

Not only is the toy selection top notch (toys from other countries I‚Äôd never seen before) everything was spotless and the hand sanitizer was plentiful. The kids did some water colors, some rock climbing, jumped in the foam pit, made multiple meals in the incredible pretend kitchen, went down the slides over and over‚Ä¶ and well, you get the idea. Tons of fun was had by all. Will definitely be bringing the kids back whenever I need an afternoon to get some things done.

They have so many great & interactive toys, the rock climbing wall/rope wall is my son‚Äôs favorite, and the slide/play kitchen is awesome. Everything is also so clean.

Review: Front desk was nice. Maybe it‚Äôs because we are from out of town and use to cleaner facilities.  The mega air park which is half of the facility, has massive 10-18‚Äù holes all throughout it. My son counted 5. The air pressure was so low he couldn‚Äôt bounce, he just sank into the platforms like a deflating air mattress. One child fell off a slide when she leaned on a side wall, another child who I think was around 4 jumped and her foot fell into one of the holes and landed on the ground.  My son also tried to run across the inflatable bridge but when he fell off all the ‚Äúbolsters‚Äù meant to catch him were to low and he hurt his arm when he landed. After this we left. Several party rooms are crammed full of building and cleaning supplies but the doors are wedged opened. I saw 1 toddler eyeing a mop bucket she spotted in there before her dad whisked her away.  The deflating air mattress was not only zero fun, but with massive holes and exposed chords it was a safety issue too. Luckily it was so bad no kids spent more than 2-3 minutes on it before they realized no area was fun.  I did bring it to the attention of the attendant who told the manager, he or she never addressed it and allegedly said they were ‚Äúout of tape‚Äù (duct tape is also covering many other wholes that aren‚Äôt ripped opened on the Max Air area.  The back of house employee were on their phones one was even sitting up high in his chair almost asleep. Not worth the $35 for a parent and kid to jump for an hour for sure.

***update
My previous post is from a year ago and today we come in and for what we would pay for two hours now cost $23 for one hour but there‚Äôs only half the park to play in because they have been remodeling it for about a month now. We brought our own socks and the cashier said we were charged for socks and then she said no we were not charged for socks but for an hour of park time so pretty much she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about because I just wondered why prices were so much higher when there‚Äôs only half a park available. I think the girl only cared about avoiding my question so therefore she could not answer it which makes me miss the old staff. also there should be a dress code because if I have to see one more little girls butt cheeks in my face hanging out of her shorts I‚Äôm telling you what.
We used to love this place and were once members but memberships are also not available currently so it‚Äôs just not what it used to be.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be back to the shop park since there‚Äôs another one on Commons Road.

If you go don‚Äôt buy or let your kids play the games. Even if they win tickets the prizes are pathetic Let them jump, but don‚Äôt waste your money. There are also no refreshments. Over priced bottle drinks, but no actual food. They are a fun thing to do once, but don‚Äôt waste your money. Let your kids go outside and play like they are meant to.

Review: I brought my five year old here.  He had a blast.  I jumped with him some of the time and I noticed a few things.  While there are a lot so safety pads and things everywhere; there are some areas of concern.  Some spots where the mats are separated and a kid could cut right through to the floor below.  Just watch your kids well, these spots were tucked back into corners that were hard to see.  Other then that my child had a great time.  He played on everything there and had a blast.  It's I great place to let your kids burn off some energy.

I was anxious the whole time that my kids were going to get trapped in the inflatable because it was so low the whole time. I literally got on it to help them and I sunk down to the floor bc the air was escaping through all the holes.

Review: I would hate to be the owner of this place listening to all these ungrateful people wine about the most ridiculous petty things like they could ever be satisfied! Crying about the price.. if you don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt pay it! If u got a boo boo on ur elbow then ur crying about it needs to be safer.. u knew what it was when u walked thru the doors. Nobody cares what u wished the price was! Pathetic! Bottom line if you don‚Äôt like something about it then go somewhere else! Don‚Äôt sign right up for all the things you want to get online and cry about when you leave! Nobody is even trying to persuade you to come in! So get tough or get out snowflake it‚Äôs that simple‚Ä¶ and sorry there aren‚Äôt any tampons in the men‚Äôs room for the ones I‚Äôm referring to

Review: We came here on Labor Day and they had a great deal for the day of $20 per person for three hours.  Normally it‚Äôs $20 for one hour. Or there is a yearly or fall membership ( no monthly anymore because of scammers I was told) It‚Äôs still a quite pricey to pay $100 for half a days worth of activities, plus another  $20 for the arcade and maybe $10 for chips and drinks at the vending machines , but we had a ton of fun.

Maybe halve of the place is trampolines and the other halve is bouncy castle stuff. I would like to see sofas for adults to sit in as most people have to resort to sitting in the massage chairs or the picnic tables.

When we visited unfortunately the zip line was not functioning and the ball pit is also gone. The x treem bounce trampoline room is really fun to try. Some of the arcade games were broke so you could not play more than one race car game at a time, but I like the overall selection of the arcade games, classic good fun. ( the air hockey is awesome! )

Review: Beware for your children. This place is the absolute worst run jump park. The people (kids) they have working there, have no care in the world. Do not supervise at all. The back super jump area had a bunch of older teenagers hangout out not jumping sitting on the mats, like this is a hangout. Which did not allow my child to jump in the area. The kid worker had to know them because he did nothing at all, just leaning against the wall with his headphones on, asleep. Then the other area is the zipline. Has the dumbest rule of only 3 rides. I get it, if is was busy, but the place is empty, when we were there. No one on the ride. Again the kid workers just hanging out. Say to bad, that's it. The dodge ball area. The balls were popped, just laying in the area. The floor in front of the area is soft about to fall through the floor. The inflatable area is dirty and some of the spots are soft, due to leaks and hard to climb up on. If there is a manager there or owner, when was the last time you walked or inspected the place for basic safety or what your employees are doing? Not in a while. There are too many other jump parks in the area to come here again. The reason we came here was for the one jump area and zip line, could barley use it. On top of the place, being dirty, unkept and not safe. I understand times are different and employees are hard to get. Let's try a little.

The only issues I saw were that the attendants working there were more interested in their phones than doing their jobs, and the massage chairs not being fully functionable.  Neither were enough to take away the 5 stars I gave them.

Review: The zip line coaster has a limit of three times through the ride. There is no line and I‚Äôve watched multiple kids get turned away just so two employees who are both playing around on their phones can do nothing except point out the sign and not have to get off their butts.  This happened last time we were here as well. It‚Äôs my kids favorite thing to do and we may not be back. The employee  a guy who is wearing shorter than average men‚Äôs shorts may also do everyone a favor by not putting his leg up while he‚Äôs sitting doing nothing, thhhhanks.

There should be no limit if it is not causing another patron to wait.Your employees are not overworked or busy, especially the guys running the zip line.

How can you people sleep at night. With every fight in me And The Good Lord's Help this place won't continue to play stupid to another child injury and then have the nerve to blame the parents.  You are responsible for every one that comes into your park just like any park should be and take SAFETY MEASURES  AT ALL TIMES PRACTICE  AND STOP PAYING ON YA PHONES LIVES ARE AT STAKE!

Review: It was fun until I broke my back!
I had fun at this park until I fractured two vertebrae of my spine! Long story short, there was an (unguarded, uncovered) foam pit which I jumped into in the dark, naturally, thinking it was safe. As I was in the air I realized there was NO foam in the pit and the ground was concrete. Between the height of my jump and my fall, I probably fell a total of 12-15 feet (the pit was seven feet deep‚Ä¶ I measured later on.) I am only alive by the grace of God alone. I could have died.
After the injury, an employee stuck her head over the edge of the pit and asked if I was ok. I could barely speak. I couldn‚Äôt move. She offered me her hand and attempted (unsuccessfully) to pull me out. (Back injury 101‚Ä¶ NEVER move the person.)
When I finally got out, the employee kind of just walked away and nobody at the park followed up, gave me ice packs,or called 911. My friends took me to the hospital.
The result of my injury was two fractured vertibre, eight weeks in a back brace, three rounds of physical therapy, and almost complete immobility for the first few weeks of the injury. It was the worst experimence of my life.
I came to the park with friends a week or two after the incident to see the scene of the crime, measure the pit (why not) and see if it was filled. It was still empty!! There was a girl guarding it who told me just that day, a little boy got back there and she had to rush to get him out of the area before he fell!
I recognize that this story is comedic. I mean who falls into a pit? But I just wanted to warn everyone about this place. It‚Äôs unsafe, the staff is not trained in injury prevention or recovery, and when I contacted the owners later on, they gaslit me and said it was MY fault. They said the had a video of a staff member telling me not to jump and me doing it anyway (funny, I don‚Äôt remember that happening. Why would I PURPOSELY jump into a pit). Don‚Äôt worry! They said no I could NOT see the video, hmmm. They also refused to help me with medical bills.
It should NEVER be possible for someone to fall in a seven foot deep pit with a concrete bottom.
If you or your kids go here, please be VERY careful.

Review: Go if you like spinal compression fractures:

Went here on Jan. 28, 2022 with a group of friends. I had a blast until one of them literally broke her back. Near the end of the night one of the members of my party accidentally bounced into an area of the park that was undergoing maintenance. It was a 7 foot concrete pit! Mind you she was jumping on a trampoline, so she didn‚Äôt fall from ground level, she fell from several feet ABOVE ground level. To be fair, there was a small plastic chain over the entrance, but my friend easily cleared this when she was double bounced in that direction. We‚Äôre estimating that she fell a distance of at least 12 vertical feet in total.

As a result, she suffered a spinal compression fracture that left her in a back brace for 8 weeks. When the injury occurred none of the teenage staff knew what to do, so thank goodness she had friends there who could take her to the emergency room. Not before a well-meaning employee offered my friend her hand and attempted to help her up, however. Word to the wise, if you‚Äôve suffered a spinal compression fracture DO NOT MOVE, it‚Äôll make things worse. In hindsight we should have called 911 and waited for the professionals to put her on a stretcher, but neither we nor the staff knew that at the time.

I wish I was making this up, but my friend is now half an inch shorter and very familiar with her local physical therapy center.

In the interest of fairness, nobody wanted my friend to fall into a 7 foot concrete pit. It even had a little chain and sign. I would argue however, that at a trampoline park, it shouldn‚Äôt be possible to do so. Laws of entropy kind of dictate that masses of bouncing people will eventually land in untended places. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spell out the need for safety nets or protective barriers to the owners of a trampoline park‚Ä¶

Aren‚Äôt there building codes for this kind of thing? Thankfully the victim this time was a 21 year old with fully developed bones. I shudder to think of the consequences if a child had fallen that distance.

Edit: the first picture shows my friend standing in front of the pit a week after the incident. The 7 foot drop had been covered with a red tarp. Notice how dark the area is? The second photo is a clearer view of the pit, and my friend‚Äôs back brace!

Wish the bounce house/maze area had more air. And the dodge ball area needs more balls. We had a group of 11 plus other kids in the facility playing with 2 balls. Very disappointing in that area.
We'll be back. It's still a fun safe environment. Especially with security walking around.

Review: The only reason I even gave one star is because the place seemed pretty clean. My son booked his daughter's birthday party here, and we will never book here again.  When you pay over $300 for 2 pizzas and water, a host, 2 hours of room time, and unlimited play, you expect to get what you pay for.  It is overpriced, you don't get what you pay for, and the employees dont seem to want to be there. First off, when we arrived, they changed the price that was quoted to him, and he was charged more than what was agreed upon. The employee didn't seem to care and didn't really try to explain the discrepancy.   The tv they have with advertisements shows that first responders get free admission. When she was asked about it, she just said no, it's 10% off. No explanation. When questioned about what it said on the screen, it seemed to make her mad that she had to go clarify with someone else. Very poor customer service. There was supposed to be a host for the party, but we only saw her once when the pizzas were brought out. (The same person that checked us in) The playtime is supposed to be ""all day"" and ""unlimited"", but when they arrived an hour early as was stated that they were supposed to do, only to be turned away and told to come back 15 minutes prior. The party was at 4 pm. The so-called unlimited play is definitely not unlimited. They only had 3 people on staff that we could see. That is ridiculous for a place that big, with parties scheduled. There's no wonder that the party ""host"" only showed once. The 2 hours of private room time is cut short, too, because they want you out 15 minutes prior to clean up. I understand that, but when you do follow the rules, then it's at least another 30 minutes before they come to clean the room. Why were you told to leave? The party next to ours had the same time frame and were still in the room another hour after their set time and were never bothered. Had we known that we would have stayed. Overall, this place is just a huge letdown. Next time, we will book at Chuck E Cheese. You at least know what you are getting there. And they have gluten-free options, too.

Review: We had a party for my 5 year old here and everything was very smooth and easy for us. The manager made sure everything was perfect, staff was attentive, and the party room was nicely stocked with everything we could need. This was the BEST party experience for us as hosting parents AND kids in attendance. We received a call ahead of time that walked us through everything and were checked on several times during the party. Food was served exactly when planned. In comparison to experiences we‚Äôve had at other popular kid‚Äôs party places this was above and beyond what I expected. I can‚Äôt say enough about how this location‚Äôs manager made our party seamless and worth every penny.

We had kids in attendance from ages 3-8 and all had a really good time.

Review: We come here 1-2x a year and it‚Äôs just enough time in between for me to forget how much I dislike this place.
While it is one of the larger play places in Gwinnett, the customer service is severely lacking. They do not have a single person monitoring the play area (Catch Air does!). If you go to an employee with a concern, they will tell you just to move to a different area or it is YOUR responsibility to find a solution.
Nothing is enforced and I am waiting to see the news report where a family is suing because of negligence.

We had such a great time at Billy Beez! The trampoline park and giant play structure kept the kids entertained for hours‚Äîit‚Äôs the perfect spot to burn off energy in a safe and fun environment. Everything was clean and well-maintained, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I also appreciated the seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. Whether it‚Äôs a rainy day or just a fun weekend outing, Billy Beez is definitely one of our favorite indoor play spots at the Mall of Georgia!

Review: I left a 5 star review about 10 months ago and highlighted then how incredibly supportive Monica was to my disabled son and personally made sure he was able to enjoy Billy Beez just like all the other kids.

Well, we just took an 8 month hiatus for personal health reasons, and on our first time back after so long, Monica remember my boy by first name!! Who does that other than family? She is as kind as supportive as ever.

I also have to highlight the manager Chimese. She is also so kind to us and always checks in with us after we arrive to make sure my son is safe and happy.

Just incredible!!

Review: Last weekend 4/27/2025, my daughter had her 6th birthday party here.  We arrived 30 mins prior, signed the paperwork and paid the remaining balance.  The young lady who checked us in was great.  She told us that our room wasn't ready but she was gonna go clean it and then we could set up. That process was smooth . Things went downhill from there.  Upon arrival in the room,  we noticed that it was super hot so we opened the door to let some air in. The temperature never really got better, so i found the young lady and asked her if the air was working she said that maintenance had been by and said they fixed it.  As my guests began arriving,  it got worse.  It was so bad,  we had to share the portable fans and few guests brought.  I constantly asked the staff to turn on the A.c. with the same response as before.  So we move on to the pizza.  I ordered an extra pizza for the parents and when the 2 bday pizzas and extra ones came out. 2 of them were burnt. We had to send them back, with hungry kids asking for more pizza. I also ordered pitchers of fountain drinks.  They were out of everything I asked for, except sprite. Not only were they out,  I had to go and pick up the pitchers myself.  I also had to serve the pizzas,  cake and clean up after the kids ate the pizza in order to make space for them to have desserts. We looked around for staff to assist us with the party,  but the 3 of them were stretched so thin we could never track them down.  This was the worst party I've ever paid for.  From extreme heat to the burnt pizza, no staff to assist.  It was just terrible. No one offered any alternatives, no assistance,  nothing.  Since that day,  I called the customer service line a few times and have heard nothing back. Customer service is lacking, besides for the young lady who checked us in.  If y'all are going to charge so much money for a party,  you all need to have the resources to accommodate each party.  When we book these parties,  we book them with the understanding that we are gonna get what we're paying for,  ie; un burnt pizza, fountain drinks that are listed, assistance during the party, air conditioned rooms that seats several people etc. I will never book with you all Again and I'll make sure my loved ones do not either. Just terrible.....

Review: Booked a party here. If I had just brought my kid here to have fun on a Saturday morning, I‚Äôd leave a 5 star review.

The pros:
The play place is VERY clean. The tunnels and slides seem well attended to. Over all the facilities are great.

The cons:

-after paying for a party package, paying for extra people on top of the party package, and paying for food- we were informed that no outside food is allowed. No veggie trays, no fruit, no drinks. It was over $80 for 12 juice boxes, they do not offer any semblance of fruit, veg or fiber. If this was offered, I would understand no outside food- but the fact is, their soda machine was down and all they have is pizza that isn‚Äôt even little ceasar quality and candy bars. If you don‚Äôt offer it and people have booked a party with you, the fair thing is to allow them to bring it.

- the place is not equipped with an intercom of any kind, so you cut your kids loose to go play- pizza comes, you want to get all those kids back in that room? Good luck - they‚Äôre in the tunnel maze.

- they started prompting us out of the room by 1:00. Our party was 11:30-1:30. If we only get 15 minutes to set up, don‚Äôt rush us out without offering help. It‚Äôs rude.

- customer service was non existent, no one offered to help us clean, they seemed inconvenienced that we had left shoes in the room.

- no one wished my child happy birthday.

Lame.

Review: The staff at Ohana made our 3-year old‚Äôs birthday party SO smooth! They helped us with set up and break down, giving myself or my husband extra time to help our son enjoy himself. They were very clear with expectations and requirements, and helped keep us on track so that not only our time was respected, but other parties were as well.

Definitely recommend!

Review: Legitimately one of the best places to take your little for playtime.  Parents can see everything, staff are very friendly: family and safety oriented. It‚Äôs family owned. From the layout and design to the equipment, this is where you want your little one to be; not at some huge trampoline park like sky zone where the waiver is just unacceptable. Socks can be washed and reused or purchase on demand, as well as snacks. They also are a great place to host birthday parties.

Review: Great fun for toddlers and young kids. We came on a Monday afternoon and it was very nice and not a problem for our 18month old. We had the whole place to ourselves some of the time.

Obviously some kids are older and more energetic and rowdy. It‚Äôs up to every parent or grandparent to keep an eye on their own kid and monitor their safety.

You have to bring or buy socks; and the kids need rubber/gummy backed socks so they don‚Äôt slip. We were able to buy socks for two dollars.

Review: This place is an absolute madhouse we left after 23 minutes. The person at the front desk will tell every single parent if they need to keep their child out of the baby area and the parents never follow through. Once you‚Äôre on the other side of the gate the rules are not reinforced. There is no staff member directing or supervising in the actual play area. You have bigger kids trampling the toddlers, pushing, shoving while parents sit on their phones and the owner ignores. They are supposed to have a sick policy but they back down once the parents offer up any excuse. It really needs to be that if you cannot follow the rules and keep your 4-5 year old child from stomping through the designated baby area then you get kicked out. The toys do not have batteries in them and it is not just the ‚Äúfloor toys are addressed in a previous review, it‚Äôs also the hanging alphabet mat in the sensory room with no batteries and an exposed/open battery housing which is a hazard and against state regulations. Also loose and missing screws in the play kitchen in the back hallway. There are pieces of the floor that are loose and coming up‚Ä¶again a state regulation violation. As a pediatric nurse this set up and poor management is a recipe for a serious injury. We will not be back and I do not recommend to fellow LV parents that value their children‚Äôs safety.

1. The receptionist tells you that there is different ages yet I have kids coming in a doing parkour around my 11 month old in baby room
2. There is no rules there were parents in the kids equipment up on the slides
3. Had electronics on the floor and all were dead and had no batteries
4 the baby room had this disgusting Velcro picture mat that just needs to be thrown away
5. The ride on toys all need to be bleached and sanitized they are disgusting and all brown
6. Out side of there control the parents that come there which is the only reason I gave them two stars don‚Äôt care or supervise the children at all just talking on their phones or reading while there kids are ruining the experience of other paying customers

Review: Ohana Wonder Town Playground South Mall has been nothing but an amazing place for all little children. The owner and their staff are mindful, selfless, and caring for all the children and even to parents as well.

The staff team does their best to meet every parents needs from signing a waiver or reminding you about a payment needs to happen or even looking out for your child whenever you got a little busy for a second. They are lenient and making sure the enjoyment of your kids comes first and also from needing a beverage or a snack to always able to help out.

My two boys truly enjoy going to this location. Its a perfect place for them to play, have a ton of fun, and meet new friends. They are always excited meeting new friends and become friends for along time.

Their arts and craft in the back room is truly great. They have cool stuff that goes along even with the holiday seasons. They have this interactive monitor that is really cool. Every kid loves playing with it.

They try to change stuff and upgrade throughout the season. They are a very, very clean place also.

I recommend having the monthly subscription because it is worth every penny especially if you come more than 5x a month.

I always recommend this place to all the parents with little kids! There isn't much of a place like this in Lehigh Valley! And they are opening second building in the Easton, Palmer Mall Soon. So your monthly membership is eligible for Allentown and Easton location! What an awesome thing!

If i could give them a 10 out 5, i would totally do so!!!

Review: Toddler had an absolute blast. It was clean and had plenty for her to do. I wish the parents paid more attention to their kids because there were several instances of older kids literally shoving younger ones out of the way.

Definitely a couple taller than 48"" limit who shouldn't have even been allowed in. Also saw at least one kid who was clearly sick (visibly snotty and coughing) despite their website saying they won't admit.

Will be taking my child back because it really is an adorable little spot but wish the staff were a little more vigilant/strict with their own rules.

Review: I am writing on behalf of my wife Rebecca, who previously left a review.

As she mentioned, the kids had fun and enjoyed the facility.

Speaking as a parent trying to celebrate his 2 year old's birthday and host a party for friends and family, this establishment did nothing but stress us out.

We showed up 15 minutes before the party to setup. We walked in with supplies and 2 children in hand. The worker at the front desk was adamant about us paying up front, while we're trying to set stuff down and situate ourselves. My wife expressed her anxiety, and the worker showed no empathy. No reassurance, just demanding a credit card to pay for the party.

Here we are now as 2 parents, trying to bring supplies in, and still manage to watch our kids. I get that it is a no shoes facility, but trying to run supplies from the parking lot, through the mall, needing to take shoes off, run supplies back to the back room, to put shoes back on, to go back to the parking lot...this is beyond frustrating. It is utterly ridiculous that Ohana does not have a supplies cart to assist families with setting up a party. We did not ""bring our whole house"" for a party. We had 2 boxes of supplies, a balloon banner, a food tray, juice boxes, and a case of water. This could have been a single trip if Ohana actually had a means of transport. If the cart was stolen by a previous customer, that's not my problem. Figure out a better way to keep track of your company property.

The waiver system on the computer is absolutely a breach of customer confidentiality. I should not be able to start typing and see every previous customers sensitive information.

The same worker came in our party room at 11:55 and asked us to start cleaning up. We didn't even get the full 2 hours to enjoy the party. We were rushed out of the room to clean up for a party at 2. 2 hours needed to clean up the room? This is again extremely inconvenient for your morning party.

Leaving the party, we had to rely on the generosity of our family members to carry everything back out, along with the gifts that were brought for the birthday girl. Trays of hot food, heavy cases of water...the only way out of the facility is the same walkway you came in. Only now you have to fight through a crowd of parents and kids, and oh yeah, put your shoes back on amongst the crowd of parents trying to come in.

Overall, the organization of this place is an absolute joke. We were told we would be contacted with instructions a couple days before the party. WE NEVER RECEIVED A CALL! The worker had a bad attitude and was extremely unhelpful to us. The lack of transportation for supplies, and separate traffic path is inconvenient.

I urge the public to look elsewhere for your party needs. A party at this place is not worth the effort.

Review: This review was based on a one-time experience.  We hosted our 2-year old's birthday party here recently.  From a child's perspective, this was great!  Clean, space to play, the kids had such a fun time.

From an adult perspective... I am so disappointed.

When finalizing plans for the party.  I was told the staff would help with setup and break down of the party.  I was even told I would have to do ""little to nothing"" for clean up at the end.  I was given 15 minutes prior to the party to set up all of my belongings - decorations, food, and simply transporting the the supplies in from the parking lot, through the mall.  They had 1 staff member to ""help"" set up and move supplies to the back room.  Instead of immediately getting to work, she insisted I sign waivers and pay...  My hands were full with boxes, since my priority was elsewhere.  When asked if they had a trolley of sorts.  They said another family stole it so now we are out of luck... ok?

The set up was fine, but no overly accommodating.  The ""helping"" staffer didn't have any tape or other materials to assist.  So, I'm glad I brought my own.

My family started to arrive, and was asked to sign waivers and take off their shoes.  My family asked to bring their shoes and personal belongs to the back room since the shoe cubbies were just open racks.  They were told no, the shoes have to stay facing the open public mall.  They were asked to sign waivers -  My family said ""no"".  This created contention. Upon further investigation.  One could see that the waiver programming is faulty.  Guests could simply look up guest's sensitive information due to predictive typing.  This made my friends and family uncomfortable.  When brought up, it was brushed off as a ""cute mistake"".

Party persists, we are guaranteed 1-hour of uninterrupted time because the establishment doesn't open until 11 am and our party starts at 10 am.  The 1 staff member complains and says the other worker read the schedule wrong and has yet to show up and help her... ok?  The 1 staffer allows people of the public to checking in around 10:50 am and they are in our party space before 11 am.  A bit upsetting since we paid to have the space until opening.  Ironically, the first non-party child hit the birthday girl upon entrance.  So, that's cool.

Finally we move to the back room for our 30-45 minutes of cake and food.  We eat in our tiny room and sing ""Happy Birthday""  The staffers comes up at 11:55 am and starts telling people it's that time to leave.  We are already cleaning tables and taking down decorations.  She told me there was another party coming up.  I said, ""That party starts at 2:00pm, we will be out very soon.""  She starts taking down decorations around the guests.  I said, ""Hey we aren't going to keep the balloon arch, you can pop it.  We do not want to put it back in our car.""  She said, ""We don't have space to store balloon arches."" I replied ""Right, so pop it, we do NOT want it.""   This turned into a fight.  She explained the balloon is my possession and my responsibility.  I explain, it is trash and can be treated as ""helping clean up"" to get rid of it.  She said is she said, ""If I cleaned up every balloon arch, I would be popping balloons for hours.""  I said FINE.  I started popping all the balloons in front of her.  She rolled her eyes and ran for the door and said, ""You could at least close the door"" maybe to not scare the other 25 children playing who were trying to get free food from our party?  Well, this could have been remedied by the staff popping the balloons themselves.  Alas.

Overall, I wish the staff kept their promises of time-frames, setup and break down, and just treated myself and family like we mattered for 2 hours.

Review: I love this place but they need to enforce a rule about no visibly or audibly coughing sick kids. Last time I went someone brought their child that was a just coughing up a storm all over the other kids. It‚Äôs genuinely upsetting that some parents don‚Äôt care about my child health enough to keep their sick kids at home. Please enforce this because I work too hard teaching my baby healthy habits for someone to just come and ruin that because they don‚Äôt care about my child‚Äôs health.

Review: I took my son and he absolutely loved it. We will definitely be going back. They're super clean and the staff is super friendly and great with the kids. I can't remember the one staff's named but she played with my son and another kid showing  them how to use certain toys and they loved her. They started calling her teacher lol. Also gave a suggestion and they were very open to it. I would highly recommend.

Be prepared to know that it is a bit newer, and you could experience delays checking in when getting there when it opens or during busy times.
Also 11am open.

But definitely recommend. Just be patient.

Review: We visited this place while on vacation and my son loved it here. They had spaces for the younger children and older children. Three slides, ball pit, small trampoline, ceiling net, play cars, and toys. There was not much selection at the cafe and the bakery items had been left out too long so they were hard and I wasn't able to get any (I wanted a muffin & cinnamon roll but both were rocks), I did get a cookie and that was wrapped in parchment and good. 1000% would come back if it wasn't 13 hours from my home.

Review: Savanah was great with customer service - I called before my visit because the space was new to me. They offer military discount and initially was about $12 for one 3 year old and two adults. My daughter had a blast in the indoor play space but there is also an outdoor option as well. There is a lot for the little ones to engage in. There is also a smaller section to the right for the infants. Everyone should wear socks but they also offer shoe covers for adults.  It's just an overall good space for a short fun activity day.

Review: Children are not being watched by parents. My 14 month old got a ball intentionally thrown at her head by a big kid. The mom saw and did‚Äôt say anything. The small kid area is full of big kids that almost ran over my small toddler. She barely got to enjoy the small kid area because no one was speaking up. The nastiest part is a parent was walking around with her bare feet. I said something to the attendant. She said she would say something but never did. Disgusting! People were walking around with their shoes on everywhere. I did not feel comfortable letting my toddler crawl around. If you have a toddler that is still crawling, I‚Äôd advise you not to bring them. I drove 45 mins from Grovetown, GA just to be extremely disappointed. I will never be coming back.

The staff's warmth and commitment ensured a tidy and completely safe environment for the kids to have the time of their lives. They thoroughly enjoyed the big Lego blocks, sandplay, and slides. The Flintstone cars were an absolute highlight, even though I wish there was a specific area for them to ride without any worries. The 40-minute drive was well worth it to see my grandkids beaming with joy and exhaustion after hours of playtime!

I‚Äôve never felt more triggered at a play place seeing my son get ran over by big kids and adults whom have no business playing.

Review: The hive is very neat! This small town needed this after Polk county remolded the outdoor playgrounds. This is going to be a popular place on hot, rainy and cold days! This is a great indoor playground and has many sensory play area for little ones, plus a under 3 baby/toddler zone. They even have a semi private area that can be rented for parties. My 11 month old and 6 year each had there only spaces and had fun for hours. I also appreciate nit having to worry about big kids/teenagers running around and nocking into my child which is sometimes you find at parks and some of the larger indoor playground, jumping gyms.

There is different lanes for sensory and imagination play. Each of the 4 lanes are themed, under the sea, construction zone, outdoor/picnic, and house/doll. The only call out is we noticed the bottom baseboard in the lanes had a rough texture, so if not careful, could get a splinter. All the other boards in the place were smooth and laquered.

Something to note, we hadn't been before they moved the baby zone but talking to some parents, they voiced they didn't like how small it is now. The baby zone used to be where the party area is now. Parents were saying there was more room for them to run around and spread out. On the other hand I could understand the need for larger party area to accommodate larger parties. I didn't mind the baby area and we there on Sunday afternoon after the church crowd. The only thing I didn't like was the net gate used to act as a baby safety gate. Toddlers were climbing over it, under it and around it where it's only attached and hooked at the bottom. Looks broke. Would like to see a solid 3' wall with a swinging gate like at the entrance of the place.

There are a few adult games scattered about, table games like checkers, Jenga and chess. There are large yard games like corn hole, connect 4, tick tac toe.

There is plenty of tables with metal bar stool seats. I personally would have liked to see lower seating with back support that is more children friendly and more comfortable for parents to lounge while the kids play. However they do have two leather futon couches and 4 cushioned arm chairs towards the stage, set up in two living room style sets. There are also plenty of high chairs for babies and they looked clean!

The hive offers WiFi and a variety of refreshments and snacks. I had one of there nitro coffees (never had before) but was very good and creamy. The flavoring range is surprisingly amazing if you are willing to be adventurous and try new things. The also offer craft sodas, teas, and traditional coffee drinks you get at a coffee shop. There is ice cream, we got the waffle bubble and it was so yummy. So much ice cream for the $7. So worth it. There are snacks starting at $1, chips, gummies, dunkaroos, etc.

My daughter keeps asking me when we are going to go back again. Great hangout place, for. Both parents and kids. A little bit of everything for everyone.

Review: We  had my son's birthday party there today. While I do believe it is a fair rate, I highly recommend gaining clarity for overall logistics prior to your party such as where face painting will be and how it should go. We lost a bit of time with the assumption that the person will come to us. This is not the case.  is ONE person providing this service for the ENTIRE facility.
Even if your room isn't ready...YOU DO NOT GET THAT TIME BACK.
If you have a party package that includes karaoke, ASK THEM FOR THE MACHINE. They will not simply have it readily available. You must ask them for it...Your bill will still be the SAME.

Despite expectations not being fully met, we still gave a very generous tip because the children enjoyed themselves. This is also why I am still giving 4 stars. This was my son's first birthday and we will be back to enjoy, but maybe not for a planned event.

Review: My daughter always has a great time here. This time, upon leaving, we realized that someone took her Jacket from the cubby.

I went to the front desk to ask about what the protocol was for missing items. The front desk lady told me they aren't liable and then went on to the next customer... I remained standing there while she ignored me. I then went up to the other lady at the front desk and asked if I could leave my phone number in-case it was returned as the other girl just ignored me. The first lady I spoke to then caught an attitude with me, saying she didn't ignore me... but she clearly did. I understand they aren't liable but the service I received when asking a question REALLY put me off. We won't be returning because of this .

It says it comes with happy birthday themed decorations! Please know they threw a few balloons in the room and 1 table cloth. Had they advertised that I would have brought my own decorations. Had to ask could they place table cloth on the kids table. Other kids were coming in taking the balloons and our other things so no regulation from the host there. The party host barely came in the room to check in on us. We had to go to her for questions. Gave kids their food and juice box but no Napkins were handed out. There was one song that was playing then it would go off for a while and played again the entire time. I wouldn‚Äôt waste my money on a party again but would come to just bring kids to play.

Review: I‚Äôve had 2 experiences here. The first was at their noon years eve event which was so much fun for my 3 year old. They had several stations and Bluey was there. I was surprised with how clean it was despite the place being packed with kids. The toddler area is large so I thought I‚Äôd bring my 1 year old back again. I saw one woman with her shoes on but everyone else was in socks.

Second time here was horrible. It was a Sunday evening an hour before closing. I waited at the front for 5 solid minutes before someone checked me in. I had my 1 & 3 year olds. There was a party ending and kids were running all around the place with shoes on. And many adults had their shoes on too. There was no one enforcing the no shoes situation which is gross to me because young babies and toddlers need to crawl around in here. The place was a mess, as there was random trash, empty drink cans and food trays around the bouncers. I‚Äôm happy there are other indoor play areas because I will not be back here again.

Review: We needed an alternate venue for my kid's birthday due to Hurricane Helene flooding our original venue. The staff was very accommodating and we were able to secure this place a day before the party. All the kids had a ball and the parents appreciated the pivot to such a fantastic location.

Review: Had a birthday party for our 3 year old. Planned last minute due to weather change and they were very accommodating. Amanda helped set up and round up the kids who all had a fantastic time. There is a nice mix of activities for various ages from toddler to bigger kid and the price point was a lot more reasonable than some similar alternatives.

Review: HippoHopp is a great place for kids to come and have a great time! It‚Äôs located near the Buckhead area. Trust me all the kiddos love it. I took my Godson here today and we had a ball! The bouncy houses, the jungle gym and even the food area was nice. He also got pizza and a juice box (which was included in the ticket I purchased online). For only $16 plus tax you can‚Äôt beat that. The ticket was for all day play as well, so we could stay as long as we like. I enjoyed so much I can‚Äôt wait to come backüòäüòä.
The customer service was really good too, which is very important. The workers/owners were really nice and attentive ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bathrooms were pretty clean as well for it to be a children‚Äôs place, I appreciated that a lot!

Review: We needed a place to go to wear our 2 yr old down before nap. This was the perfect place and size! The parking lot looks sketchy but it is really nice inside! My only critique is I wish there was an employee enforcing the toddler only area more. My daughter was in the toddler only area and had to navigate around 5+ year olds running around in that area.

The food & snacks for kids are priced nicely and there are seats all over for parents who need to work on their laptops (free Wi-Fi too üòÅ).

Between the bouncy houses, obstacle course, climbing wall, slides, cotton candy machine (it's very cool - be sure to try it), massage chairs it was difficult for all the kids to leave at the end of the party.

Review: This is one of those places where you can relax while your kids are having a blast.  Our kids like the super-race-car bouncy and obstacle course - while we like to sit in the middle of the facility in the massage chairs getting mall style massage.

We personally like their food options for kids and adults.  Their smoothy with spinach and blue berries is a nice touch to lure kids into having their 'super foods' without them knowing.

Sometimes when it becomes too chaotic at home to work and manage kids (especially during summer holidays like now) - we hop into this place, let kids play wild while we catch up on our work.  Their seating area is quite comfy for this!

Owners are personable and we always have great time at HippoHopp!

Review: This place is literally trash. It stinks, everything‚Äôs dirty, and they barely have anything to do. They probably have like three bouncy houses, and that‚Äôs about it. There are so many other places, like Catch Air, which are way nicer and have many things to do for kids of all ages. My daughter got severely sick after going here; she caught HFMD from the filthiness. Please avoid it at all costs.

The owners work really hard to make the experience for kids and families a fun, clean and easy one. The food is good, LOVE the healthy, organic, GF & vegan options!  99% of the time the other grown ups do a great job watching their kids and making sure everyone treats each other with respect. We love how there is something for all ages, our child has been able to do a little bit more as the years pass. Thank you to the owners for being so caring and hands-on.

They only charge for the kids which is nice. A great way to get out of the house and escape from the heat. We ended up getting a hippo card (aka gift card) which you can load store credit on to save 25% on admission. They have food offerings which you can use your hippo card on and party rooms too for groups.

Review: My son adores coming to HippoHopp and asks for it at least once a week. If your child loves different  types of boucy houses then they will love coming. There is also a large toddler play zone that makes things safe for littles. The price is one of the lowest I have found and the discount with their HippoCard is great. It is not the fanciest in Atlanta but at the price you will want to come all the time.

Review: Literally love this place - the sensory/toy area is fun, playground is great, love the layout and ability for adults to be up at the bar, high top area, or down on comfy chairs/couches! Staff is friendly, price for it is unbeatable.
I will say it‚Äôs a definite plus that the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs bathrooms both have changing tables, a small potty seat for littles + a step stool for the sink!

Review: The hive is very neat! This small town needed this after Polk county remolded the outdoor playgrounds. This is going to be a popular place on hot, rainy and cold days! This is a great indoor playground and has many sensory play area for little ones, plus a under 3 baby/toddler zone. They even have a semi private area that can be rented for parties. My 11 month old and 6 year each had there only spaces and had fun for hours. I also appreciate nit having to worry about big kids/teenagers running around and nocking into my child which is sometimes you find at parks and some of the larger indoor playground, jumping gyms.

There is different lanes for sensory and imagination play. Each of the 4 lanes are themed, under the sea, construction zone, outdoor/picnic, and house/doll. The only call out is we noticed the bottom baseboard in the lanes had a rough texture, so if not careful, could get a splinter. All the other boards in the place were smooth and laquered.

Something to note, we hadn't been before they moved the baby zone but talking to some parents, they voiced they didn't like how small it is now. The baby zone used to be where the party area is now. Parents were saying there was more room for them to run around and spread out. On the other hand I could understand the need for larger party area to accommodate larger parties. I didn't mind the baby area and we there on Sunday afternoon after the church crowd. The only thing I didn't like was the net gate used to act as a baby safety gate. Toddlers were climbing over it, under it and around it where it's only attached and hooked at the bottom. Looks broke. Would like to see a solid 3' wall with a swinging gate like at the entrance of the place.

There are a few adult games scattered about, table games like checkers, Jenga and chess. There are large yard games like corn hole, connect 4, tick tac toe.

There is plenty of tables with metal bar stool seats. I personally would have liked to see lower seating with back support that is more children friendly and more comfortable for parents to lounge while the kids play. However they do have two leather futon couches and 4 cushioned arm chairs towards the stage, set up in two living room style sets. There are also plenty of high chairs for babies and they looked clean!

The hive offers WiFi and a variety of refreshments and snacks. I had one of there nitro coffees (never had before) but was very good and creamy. The flavoring range is surprisingly amazing if you are willing to be adventurous and try new things. The also offer craft sodas, teas, and traditional coffee drinks you get at a coffee shop. There is ice cream, we got the waffle bubble and it was so yummy. So much ice cream for the $7. So worth it. There are snacks starting at $1, chips, gummies, dunkaroos, etc.

My daughter keeps asking me when we are going to go back again. Great hangout place, for. Both parents and kids. A little bit of everything for everyone.

I promised to bring them back. I love the location as it is right down the street from us and I feel like there are no other play gyms in the East Cobb area. I called earlier in the day and spoke with the owner. She was so nice and the epitome of excellent customer service. As a mom, I love the setup. I can see the entire play room at all vantage points and I don't have to worry about losing sight of one of my kids. It's also the perfect environment to bring my 8 month old as well next time. The setup allows me to take all 3 of my kids by myself without unnecessary fear or anxiety of not being able to see all kids at once. Also all the other parents and children were fun! It was such a great atmosphere that I too enjoyed myself.

If you have a toddler, keep a close eye on them as, unfortunately, some parents of older kids may not be so attentive and they can play a little rough. My only suggestion to the owners is don't be afraid to ""kindly encourage"" some of the inattentive grownups to make sure their kids are playing nicely!

Review: I was impressed with the layout of the space as it's a good size and  you don't feel like you'll ""lose"" your child while they're running around. There were plenty of fun and innovative options for play and the appointment time is great because you can insure that there aren't too many people in the space for it to feel overwhelming. So happy to have this option in East Cobb!

Review: We went to The Playroom today and had a blast! The owner was so nice and easy to talk to and the atmosphere in the play space is amazing. My daughter is 3 and my son is 5 and they both had so much fun. We have tried almost every indoor playground and trampoline park across the metro Atlanta area and this was one of my favorite experiences. The facility, although not very big, had tons of things that captured the attention of my kids and allowed them to have creative play for hours. Since the space isn‚Äôt huge like a lot of other indoor playgrounds/trampoline parks, it was actually really easy to keep track of the kids and I was even able to relax while there. We loved it and will be back again!

Review: What a great atmosphere to be able to bring your child for a play session! When you walk in, the area is clean and well maintained, the equipment is incredibly varied for all ages (including a gated area for crawlers and early walkers that has comparable equipment to maintain their attention.) We were so taken back by how welcoming the owner was as well as her dedication to creating a space that is inviting and truly inclusive--from the color palette on the walls (fun without being overstimulating) to the utilization of space (even a separate snack/meal area!) and upcoming classes, she has created an environment that you can feel confident bringing your child to!

Pictures are deceiving. Also, I paid for the hour and socks, just to be told 30 minutes in that I had to leave because of a private party and was not refunded any amount of money. Why wasn‚Äôt I told that before paying ? Or price cut in half? The young girl that worked there seemed very out of place and had no motivation to her whatsoever. They definitely have some work to do.

Review: The fun we had!  I booked a party for my son's 5th birthday party and booked for the whole facility.  My sister lives near here and told me about the place but we didn't know what to expect.  I visited it about 2 weeks before the party to check it out.  One thing my son wanted was a huge bouncy house for him and his friends to bounce on.  Well, they had a obstacle course one which was great.  They also had a toddler area which was perfect for me because it was a place my 1 year old could go play while the kids were on the bigger bouncy area.   When the birthday party came, I was a wreck but the staff was so helpful.  They helped me setup, made sure my food was stored in a great place and just helped the party.  The kids apparently loved the toddler zone.  They stayed there the most!  It was a blast and I have to thank the staff for making my son's birthday great.

Oh and we added the face painter and she was awesome as well.  So sweet and patient with the kids.

Women bring their kids like it‚Äôs a daycare a chill out on the bench a let them just run wild in what I considered less age appropriate for them. The young man that was there could give two diapers less about anything going on. I love that it looks black owned but other than that it was a disappointment.

Review: I think the concept of this place is very cool and offers parents an outlet and place for their kids to release energy in a climate controlled environment.

The issues that I have with this place are; they have a toddler time for under 3 year olds, but it‚Äôs not in an enclosed area where parents can kind of relax and monitor their children.
They have an entrance area that should be gated,  so that kids are enclosed so and can safely play while being monitored by a seated parent, and that doesn‚Äôt require you to constantly chase them. I really dislike this lack of a feature at this establishment and it truly has a negative effect on the experience when going.

this is a place for children to play and I feel like it‚Äôs also a place where parents can go and possibly get some work done or socialise with other parents while safely monitoring their children play with other kids.

The lack of having a gated area does not allow this at all. It‚Äôs also quite dangerous to have an open area that a young child under the age of three could simply walk out and open the door and go outside and get hit by a car.

Next, There are not bicycles in the area.  with children that are under three years old , it‚Äôs kind of overkill asking them to constantly come off of the mat area. A heavier woman kept redirecting my child off of the mat. Why have bikes in the same area? People do different things. No one has ever mentioned this before or had a problem.

Then, they have an upselling scheme of charging you $4 if you forget your socks. I have about five pairs of socks at this point because I do end up forgetting the socks whenever I spontaneously decide to come by this place.
you would think they had some type of system.
It‚Äôs literally just a tactic to make more money.
Toddler Socks don‚Äôt cost $4 for 1 pair.
If a child is wearing socks, it‚Äôs ridiculous to even charge to buy theirs.

I feel the quality of children and parents is low class and I had an experience where a child put my child in a headlock and left a scratch of my child‚Äôs neck.
The child was a bit older and clearly had some behavioural issues as the parent was not able to communicate effectively for the child to acknowledge they had done something wrong.
For this reason in addition to the other concern stated, I decided that I won‚Äôt be coming to this place anymore.

It‚Äôs truly a shame because there isn‚Äôt anything else that‚Äôs in this area, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable paying $17 for one hour of letting my kid play and also subjecting my child to certain dangers. It‚Äôs not worth it.

Review: Initially, I didn't like it. It's a small place. I don't think the little rolling things should be so close to the play area especially when there are large party groups right next to the play area. I'm a first-time father so I'm very protective of my baby boy. We were celebrating his first birthday and I understand that the world doesn't revolve around but the other little kids are still little kids but NOT my kid so their being so careless around him didn't sit right with me even considering their young states. One kid was reckless on the rolling thing and ran into my new Jordans while his mom sat stuffing her face. That irritated me a bit but once I focused on my little guy and how much fun he was having it was all worth it.  But I will say that it was neat and clean and kids can have fun there and maybe when he's older we may give it another shot. They did inspire me to get my little guy a bounce house and trampoline although they don't have one. I would post pictures but I've got a thing about posting permanent pictures of my kid on the net. I would recommend it for maybe 2 and older. And if you're a decent parent who watches their kids and teaches them things.

They also have another side with an obstacle course. Great place to host a kids birthday party with lots of sitting space and activities. Ms. Tiffany and Ikia anrr always so welcoming and knowledgeable when it comes to kids.

Review: We had an awesome experience at The Playpad. I‚Äôd taken the day off work and was looking for somewhere to take my 3-year old to kill some time in the afternoon. I found The Playpad on the map and decided to head over. I pre-purchased my ticket through my mobile device (the page was cut off so I couldn‚Äôt see some of the text but that was a minor inconvenience). They had several ride on toys and 2 bouncy areas that my son enjoyed. There were not many people so that was nice. They also have a soft play area that‚Äôs nice from smaller kids. We also enjoyed the large connect four and the virtual reality game. There was also a camp going on while we were there and the kids were enjoying crafts. They have chips Sam‚Äôs juice for sale and there‚Äôs a dominoes next door. Parking was also a breeze. Overall, it was a great experience! The customer service was exceptional, I felt like my kid was safe and having fun, and it was a good value for the price. It‚Äôs small but it doesn‚Äôt take much to entertain a 3 year old and he had a ball!!

Review: I had my baby‚Äôs first birthday here, I would not advise anyone to party here at all. I rented the entire place for a private party . She only allowed 10 kids which is ridiculous. We paid for the extra kids which made no sense if I have the building for the party. The treatment she gave us was rude and uncalled for.  She aggressively threw us out of her establishment. Turning over tables so we wouldn‚Äôt sit. She threw away decorations and took pictures of my party as though she had a hand in it besides providing the building . I asked for the pictures taken throughout the entire celebration by her staff she refused to send them. First of all she didn‚Äôt get any consent from everyone. Comparing my experience to someone else 3 years ago she has definitely forgotten the importance of customer service . There was no reason to be intentionally impolite. I wouldn‚Äôt dare trust my child with her for a camp. I hope this helps someone make a decision.

Review: I came here with my daughter. I see that this place needs to upgrade and repair many things. The most worrying thing is that the slide is not good when sliding in a supine position to the end of the path or the baby bumps his head on the floor. The staff should pay attention to review this part. I went to Giggle Town where they gave away free socks for parents and children, more games and an entry price of only $10 for unlimited hours. This place has limited hours and the ticket price includes tax of $16 and 1 candy here is sold for $4. You can see ‚ÄúGiggle Town‚Äù they make a lot of games. My comment here is that I want the business to develop and provide better quality service. Although you guys are doing very well, you also need to change to be better and better for customers. I give you 5*, support you, great friends and hope you do better for the little angels and for the community. Thank you

Review: We have been coming here for quite sometime now and my kids love it! To the daddy daughter dances, spring festivals and spring/summer camps they have always had great activities year around. As my oldest is on the spectrum and sometimes has a tough time with transitions they are understanding/helpful with using her timer when it‚Äôs time to exit or an activity is ‚ÄúAll Done‚Äù she just loves it there and would stay longer if she could. I have met majority of the staff to the owner, Miranda and Angel they have all been supportive and as an Autism parent I feel confident in dropping both of my Girls off to camp bc of the great communication they now have on a App.

Review: Brought the kids here for some much needed time out of the house after the snow day last weekend. We'll be back.

-Booking online was easy
-Pricing was good
-Staff is friendly.
-Lots of variety in activities.
-Suitable mostly for younger kids. I could see kids around 8-9 getting bored, but your mileage may vary and this isn't a criticism, merely my observation.
-We went when they opened; we were the only family for about half an hour. Not sure how busy it gets, but I could see it getting crowded pretty fast during peak times.
-The people griping about cleanliness need to get a grip. The place is clean, but it's also an indoor playground for children. It's never going to be medically sterile, and kids play in dirt when they go outside anyways.

Like I said, there was enough variety in activities that our kids didn't get bored in 2 hours. From physical activities to imaginative and interactive playsets, and a quiet room for kids with sensitivities, they cover a lot of bases.

It's more suited for younger kids, as I mentioned before. It's not as high energy and high speed as a place like Catch Air, so older kids may not enjoy it as much. But it's way easier here to keep track of your kids, since it isn't huge, and you don't have to worry about bigger kids knocking your toddler over on their way to a slide.

We'll definitely be back. On rainy days or days where we just need a break, it'll be nice to bring the kids to a place close by where they can burn off some energy in a safely contained space with lots to do.

Don't listen to the grouches. This place gets five stars.

Every time I have been here it has been exceptionally clean, especially compared to other children‚Äôs play places in the area.  I feel like people tend to forget that this is a place that constantly has children in and out playing.  It obviously is not going to be a sterile and clean as a hospital.

Review: First time visiting today for their New Years Eve bash. Our twins had a good time, but the cleanliness and attention to what is going on around the gym is to be desired. Additionally, $100 for two kids with zero food provided or anything outside of the ordinary is exorbitant. We could have visited one of many Atlanta attractions and purchased a FAMILY membership for this price.

In shock, we also watched as one of the workers children physically pulled another child from one of the ‚Äúride in‚Äù cars by their hair while yelling ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my car, that‚Äôs my car‚Äù while the father stood on his phone just inches away doing nothing.

Inclusivity is paramount in our twins lives, of course, along with cleanliness and safety. We had high hopes for this neighborhood kids gym, but unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be returning.

Review: This was my first visit, and I will never return. The only positive aspect of this place was the staff‚Äîthey were friendly and nice. However, the layout needs improvement, especially the placement of the swings. They should not be positioned in the middle of the space. Both kids and adults were frequently hit by the swings, and parents had to carefully navigate the area multiple times when passing through with their children. The floor plan of the kids' playroom is poorly organized. The worst part of the visit, though, was the cleanliness. The owner needs to hire someone to clean the place at least once a day. They charge for kids as young as 7 months, and all children, especially babies, deserve to play in a clean environment. If they want to continue operating, they must maintain proper hygiene. I am extremely disappointed and will not return. I would never let my child play in such a filthy place.

Review: We absolutely love We Rock the Spectrum! The play area has been updated to include tons of new activities, keeping my 4 year old and almost 3 year old entertained for hours.  The new owners and staff are beyond spectacular! I struggle juggling 2 toddlers and a baby and they are always happy to lend a hand in rounding up my kids and helping to get shoes and jackets on so we can leave - though my kids would stay forever if I let them.

We are also enrolled in the Spanish class and I can't speak highly enough of this program!  I had been looking for a program that would accept 2 year olds and this is the only one in the North Atlanta area that I could find. Ms. Johana is the best teacher ever! She engages the children with creative lessons and just after a few sessions my children are speaking Spanish.  They ask every day when are we going to Spanish class.

If you haven't checked this place out yet, then get on it ASAP!  I promise you won't regret it!

Review: We checked the operating time before taking our 2 sons to there yesterday - on Saturday, it was updated by the business 5 days ago 9:30AM - 6PM. However, when we arrived there at 4PM-ish and were told they are closing at 5PM, asked the staff about the operating hours which is updated just 5 days ago, he said the new closing time will be at 5PM for every day (with a ""I'm ready to go home"" attitude). Well, it was not worth for almost $40 for not even an hour playing, but my sons were very excited to play so that's why I still paid when was told about the closing time at 5PM.

The place is pretty okay for kids. Though mostly basic toys and some okay interactive areas but a little on the expensive side for what it is for a single visit.

Update: After submitting this review the owner called and offered an apology and explained google didn‚Äôt  have the correct times for Sunday. She was very nice and seemed genuine. This kind of action goes a long way with me supporting businesses so I‚Äôll likely visit again.

Review: We came here before and things were  OK but coming back today it seems like the maintenance has not been kept up. They don't have drinking water even though they have a water fountain. They make you buy the water. $20 for two hours and they don't provide water. They have black trash bags over the windows. The jumperoo is deflated. And there's not a single place for the parents to sit down. The girl at the front desk was so rude when I asked about water and I overheard her asking a customer on the phone ""why are you calling?"" in a very rude tone. No doubt the idea behind this place is commendable but the functionality and the personalities here are leaving a lot to be desired. We unfortunately won't be coming back.

Review: We love this place and even had our toddler's birthday party here, but recently they have been closed/closing early without notice. It's almost like every time we go -- they're not open. It's a recipe for a meltdown with a toddler and for kids with special needs. We diligently check the Facebook page before coming, and still we're met with a ""sorry we're closing early"" as we get there even when the online schedule says otherwise. We pre-paid for packages that we're not getting to use because of their erratic scheduling. Once or twice is understandable, but we will avoid this place now  because it's not worth the hassle of a surprise early closing.

Review: I really like this place, especially when it's not super busy. For the most part, other parents are really good about being present, but sometimes people don't watch their kids well and they can be super rough which is really awkward because you don't want to say something to someone else's child and I am not comfortable confronting another parent. There is a staff member that I see there most of the time and she does a great job at picking up and resetting the area throughout the visit. I can tell when they clean the place because you can tell a difference in the way the floors feel. Not sure how to be able to tell with the toys though ha! For a children's play gym, I don't know why but I expected the staff to be super friendly and welcoming, but it's not really that kind of vibe. This is all just my opinion by the way. Others could certainly have a different experience.

My only complaint, which I think just comes with any children's center, I believe they run some sort of therapist program through the gym and twice now we have caught some sort of funk from a child in that program. The first time, a child coughed right on my child's head. I know that child did not know what they were doing so I am not upset with the child, but is there not a  sick policy in place? The second time we caught something, I noticed we were jumping on the trampoline with a child who had a giant green blob coming out of their nose. Again, I just wonder if there is any sort of sick policy and if not it would be wonderful to have one in place. I know children are going to get sick and that's just part of it, but I also don't agree that  it's okay  to send a child who is obviously sick into a play area with other children. Overall, I think this is a great place to take your children. I have recommended them to all of my friends with kids and will continue to do so.

Review: We used to love coming in to play but we were so disappointed by our visit today. Toys were scattered everywhere. In the past staff members were constantly cleaning up and kept the areas neat however today staff members sat and chatted and never picked up the mess. Prices went up but all of their toys are now broken and worn.

Review: This place will watch you with cameras (off duty) and call the staff to break up parents taking to each other. They do not sanitize their play area, and would rather blame parents for the dirtiness instead of cleaning it.

Review: Unfortunately, this is the first time I‚Äôve come here and seen the place in such disarray. Toys all over the floor, unsafe to walk, toys on the trampoline. About 20 minutes after open play started and the place is a mess!.Didn‚Äôt look adequately staffed as in past experiences. Saw no one trying to clear floor or wiping equipment. Lots of kids!Was there less than 5 minute and left. Hope I can get a refund. Don‚Äôt usually write negative reviews, but couldn‚Äôt pass this time! Didn‚Äôt look like a safe environment, even with parents supervising their children.

Review: Came here with my 4 year old and 1.5 year old and they had a blast! My only complaint is I wish the zipline area was fenced off somehow so kids couldn't accidentally wander over there and get knocked over, as well as the swing area. Or failing that, that there were gates around the toddler play area so you could contain little kids better. I had to follow my 1.5 year old like a hawk the entire time we were there because she kept wanting to walk into the swing area or under the zipline and almost got knocked over a bunch of times. I understand it's the parents' job to supervise and I was doing that but it would have made the experience so much less stressful if I could have plopped her in a more contained space and not had to constantly worry about a bigger kid crashing into her.

Review: Great concept in a nice location, however we had a terrible experience! I have a 3 year old son that could and should have had a fabulous time but they allowed several older children (7,8,9 and older) to go absolutely wild in there. This is a very small place, which is perfect for younger children, but older rough and rowdy boys have NO business being there with younger children. The older children dominated the entire place. The parents just let them run wild and never checked on them. In the meantime, I was having to follow my son around and tell him he couldn‚Äôt do anything because the older kids were on the equipment. There SHOULD be an age limit or if not then definitely different times for different age groups. They need to have a time frame for the younger children where they can play and have fun SAFELY! We paid close to $20 but had to leave after maybe 30 minutes because my son was going to get hurt. Another big issue was they only had ONE young teenage girl working. She had absolutely NO control of the situation and had no business being there by herself. I am shocked no one got hurt. If you have young children I would NOT recommend this place as they are subject to get hurt since they have no rules or regulations on how many children are allowed in or how old and wild they act. It‚Äôs a real shame because it could be a wonderful place for young children to play especially when it‚Äôs too hot outside for them to play.

Review: Really wanted to love this place for my 23 month old, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great for smaller toddlers. The zip line area is not roped off, so it was a constant battle trying to stop him from running in front of the zip line and getting kicked in the face. There were also a lot of older kids there on the trampoline, etc. which made it hard for my little one to play. I think it‚Äôs a great place for older kids, but it was tough to take my almost-2 year old there.

Review: This place has potential and from other reviews, it seems I‚Äôm one of the rare bad experiences. I took my toddler there once and she was getting run over by the bigger kids there for virtual learning daycare. They kept following us when we tried to get away from them. I felt like we were babysitting these kids and the employees just watched it happen. Three people working there and they were all perched on the play equipment watching them bothering us. I finally I had to yell out for someone to come get the kids. Not only that, but these kids were dirty! The girl had greasy hair and the boy had dirt under all of his nails. My daughter was overwhelmed and we had to leave.

Review: Lots of adventures and fun can be found here.  Parents are friendly, kids are having a good time.  Employees are working to keep each of the areas clutter-free and safe.  Parents can help a young kid win a prize! Hungry? A variety of basic kid-snacks are available.  There are tables where parents or friends can hang out. Adults can connect to the internet using the guest wi-fi.

Activities can accommodate children up to about eight years of age.  Older children will probably get bored here quickly.  The staff work with patrons on problem behaviors to keep things safe for everyone.

Facilities are kept clean and tidy while color-rich activities encourage kids to keep busy or just cut loose and have fun.  Children can enjoy swinging, jumping, wallowing, developing new skills and using their imagination.

We brought one toddler and the price was very affordable.  This is a great place to catch some really good photos of your little one playing.

There are plenty of restaurants in the same area to enjoy!  Take your kids here and hang out together!

We have been here for 4+ hrs and the kids don't wanna leave.  There are comfy chairs for parents including plugs near some of the seats for charging phones (bring your own charger).  There are tables and chairs for food but no eating in play areas.  It actually smells nice too and not like typical locker room or feet.  There are alarms on all the doors so if the kiddos were to try one of those doors so if seems safe.

Review: We visited on a Sunday expecting a lighter crowd, but it was quite busy. We were considering booking a birthday party for our daughter, but unfortunately, our experience wasn't ideal.

There were posted rules about running, but the staff didn't actively enforce them, and some staff members seemed inattentive. One staff member even sat on their phone for an extended period.

More importantly, my daughter developed pink eye the following day. This raises concerns about cleanliness, and I believe a more thorough hygiene protocol would be beneficial for customer health.

Given these factors, we won't be returning for a party or future visits.

The 16 yr Olds were helping the Littles (aged 1 to 3) which were 5 of them in and out of the ball pit and up the ladder into the other areas when we were told to pay for the 16 yr Olds! They weren't in there playing they were helping the little ones but had to pay the cost to play in there. I understand paying for the smaller kids aged 1 to 10. Plus paying to have a party there. But to pay for the kids that were to large to enjoy the play areas and were just helping with the smaller kids is ridiculous!! Parents were in these areas doing the same thing helping their little ones and I'm sure they weren't asked to pay. The older kids did buy tokens to play in the arcade so a lot of money was already spent in the establishment why make people who are helping pay more!! Disappointed that they treated us this way. Definitely won't be back!!

Review: My friend and I took our littles to play here yesterday. It was bigger than I expected. They had so much fun in every area. The girls restroom was clean when I went, I assume the boys is the same.
I saw several employees cleaning and keeping an eye on the kids during my visit. They were vacuuming the trampoline areas and spot vacuuming the floors to keep them clean. They constantly picked up balls from the ball pit area, and I saw one guy quickly do maintenance on a screen projector in the ball pit area.
They have something for every age. They have an area for smaller children with lots of cool toys, smaller trampolines, swings, a play kitchen with lots of toy food, and a doll castle. We visited this area first. They have an arcade room my older daughter and her friend explored.
The biggest room is the one with the ball pit, more trampolines, this really cool water thing (I don‚Äôt even know what to call it), there‚Äôs more swings, slides, tunnels, giant Lego sets, even these giant rings that you can crawl inside to make them roll around. My 4 year old loved the cars she could ‚Äúdrive‚Äù around in. She also loved the sand table with all of the molds, shovels and buckets. This place is seriously a hit!
My kids are already asking when can we go back. Lucky for them, I plan to visit again soon!

Review: The concept of this place is really good. But my complaint is my niece had a birthday party Saturday and 10 of the 15 guest all got the norovirus from j&w's ball pit and want to warn people of this before everyone and their little ones get as sick as me and my family. Great place but definitely needs to be sanitized better

Review: We've been twice now and absolutely love this place! I pray they're here to stay! Great for babies and kids, and parents can play with.
Can bring your own snacks or order from there own kitchen they have.
They have so much to offer, we didn't even know about the trampolines ""hidden"" in the back till 3 hours after we'd already been there.
Our 18mo old has an absolute blast when we're there and so have the babies/toddlers of other varying ages we've gone with for play dates.
I give it a 4.5 only because there are practically no security measures. But I mean it's the guardians responsibility to watch after your own kids, just as much as it is when you're at a public playground. Baby gates at each zone entrance would be nice and I do wish that they had a system like at Chuck-E-Cheese. Roped off entrance and a matching tag for parent and child, always checked before leaving.

Review: We were very impressed with J&W play world! Our group had ages ranging from 18 months to seven years old and every kid had a great time. The entrance fees are reasonable, in my opinion, and their membership rates are a good deal if you decide to go often. They have several party rooms that can be rented. I just peaked into the party rooms quickly and they seemed a bit plain, but that might be good if you wanted to bring your own decorations.
There are two major play areas. Visibility is good in both areas and it is easy to follow your child. Stroller accessible. Nothing contains kids to a specific play area so just be aware that if you are one person with a bunch of kids, you might have them running in opposite directions. The play gym and 'tubes' are large enough for a parent to climb with their child if needed. I felt like everything was padded and safe so I felt comfortable letting my little one roam, discover, and play.
The facility was clean and I really hope it stays that way! They do have some food items for purchase, but we brought our own snacks so I didn't really pay attention to what they had/cost etc.
There is a game room and you do need to purchase tokens for those games.
We will definitely be back!

Review: I wish I could give a better rating but I had a two star experience. There was pure chaos when we walked in. Kids running in every which direction, and people setting up party rooms with lots of equipment, flowers, etc.  When we finally finished purchasing passes and socks we tried to find a place to sit while our kids play but it was very very hot in the play area.

The main issue was NO STAFF watching the kids play AT ALL. no rules, we walked around with shoes on, no one said anything. A child can easily run off or be taken without consent at this place. It's hard to watch your child and there's no staff doing it at all.

Food was expensive and mediocre at best. They said they would call out number but they never did, and we went back to the window to find our food sitting and cold.

Our kids were bored after 30 minutes. We made them keep playing so we could at least get our food.

Nice concept, but unfortunately a fail.

I also saw a water fountain and a baby room for nursing moms. Overall the place was clean and plenty of seating areas available. Note, if your child has socks with grips at home, bring those otherwise you will have to pay for some upon entrance. As far as pricing, I think it's decent not too high could be a little lower but wasn't bad for the time my kids spent in there playing. We were there for 2hours.  10/10 would recommend!

Other indoor playground are usually too advanced for my two-year-old and their ‚Äútoddler areas‚Äù are more designed for babies. But at wiggle Giggle he can safely play in every Section. The whole center is padded, I don‚Äôt have to worry about him falling and hurting himself. At the same time, it is big enough for older children .. I witness some parents with their smaller children going down the slide, etc..

I had an opportunity to meet the owner. She is super sweet and accommodating. You can tell this place was designed by a mother.

Review: The good: the place is clean. It‚Äôs small enough for parents to sit and always be able to see their children if you‚Äôd like
The bad: when we arrived we were told our child HAD to have grip socks for safety (he had on regular socks). They made us purchase their grip socks. After we bought them and went in, NO OTHER KIDS HAD GRIP SOCKS ON. His friends came in right after us and didn‚Äôt have to buy grip socks, and several families after us also came in without grip socks. Our child was quite literally one of two kids wearing grip socks. This alone, that they made us buy their socks or couldn‚Äôt go in, and then didn‚Äôt make anybody else do it, is the reason we will not be returning.

Additionally, the activities are perfect for kids up to 10 (my personal opinion). They are not overwhelming and are fun, which reduces the requirement for a parent to help the kid with every activity. That came in handy as I was able to watch both my kids play.

Review: I had my daughter's 5th birthday party here!  Hands down best decision for location.  We rented out the facility for a private event on a Friday evening.  It was phenomenal!  We did decorate a bit with balloons and such but in hindsight all of that was unnecessary because the place is just too cute.  In addition to the indoor play area there is a bubble room, a quiet/sensory room (so cute especially for nursing moms or moms that just need a break with an overloaded toddler), two spacious party rooms, and clean bathrooms!  I just can't say it enough, the place is just too cute and I fell in love after the first visit.  Tamara and crew set up tables and chairs before we arrived and were super accommodating and just ready and willing to help with all the things.  The best part is that the kids had so much fun, they did not want to leave :) If you are considering booking your little one's party here don't waste anymore time and seal the deal, you will not regret it.

Please know that if you book here you have to have absolutely everything you need. We asked to use a knife to cut the cake and they told us it would be $10. So we went down the street to buy a cake knife from the nearest Dollar Tree. And at the end of the party they charged my daughter an additional fee of over $100. They said it was for all the adults present.. grandparents, great grandparents, aunts, uncles and the parents of the kids my daughter paid for to attend the party is too many adults?? I would never recommend anyone having their child‚Äôs party here. They let us in our party room late but rushed us out  and there was no one else coming in after us. This place is a no go for us.

Review: WIGGLE GIGGLE ü§¢

I used to love this place with my 3 year old! It‚Äôs been a few months since I‚Äôve been and decided to take my now 4 year old and infant today. The first issue is the front girl told me she couldn‚Äôt give me a receipt and it would be emailed. Ok no problem, but I never received an email! I checked my bank statement and saw she charged me for my infant. Children under 12 months are free with a sibling. The manager was extremely nice and confirmed I had been charged and issued a refund. Just a reminder to check your card if you don‚Äôt get a receipt!

So we move on to the play area. I fully expected it to be busy on a rainy Saturday. What I did not expect was how filthy this place was. It was clear they have not been cleaning properly for more than just today. I was so disappointed üòî The floors were visibly dirty and sticky, the baby area had built up dirt and grime (see pics). There was dust and hair all over the play mats in some areas. Crackers , crumbs, and food wrappers all over the floors. I have never seen it like this!

Now, I KNOW kids places are not the cleanest in general, it is what it is, but this was disgusting. So much so that I wanted to share this in a post so that other parents can avoid this place. To me it is expected that places like these should do the utmost to at least not have sticky floors and built up dirt! I‚Äôve been to plenty of places like gymboree, the little gym, buddies etc to know what to expect. Again, I‚Äôve been going here with my son for a year now and it has been much cleaner than this before! This was around noon today so it‚Äôs not like I went at the end of the day either.

The manager was helping a party so I addressed it with front desk girl. I asked if I could get a refund because I didn‚Äôt want my baby and kid playing in this filth and was ready to go. She said I couldn‚Äôt get a refund and sent a really sweet girl over to clean the baby area. The poor girl, who looked maybe 16-17 didn‚Äôt have the proper equipment to clean so much dirt and grime. She asked for a vacuum and I couldn‚Äôt hear the reason why they didn‚Äôt give her one. I just left and let it go that I wasted $20 because I‚Äôll never spend another dime here again. I should have received a refund especially since they couldn‚Äôt give the girl a vacuum to clean!

Please see pics. & zoom in!  Respectfully, This place needs a good cleaning üßº especially the baby area and the floors, your socks should not stick to the floor in some areas of this place! ü§¢

Review: The facility is nice and there is plenty of room for kids and adults to play. Today we had a birthday party for my son. We were not told that you can not have food or any party activities outside of the party room. There is no signs stating this nor is there any written documentation through the website that I could find stating this, seems as though it was just made up on the spot. The owner was very rude claiming she explained all of this on the phone, which it was not discussed prior to today. Plus we were not even allowed to open presents at the tables which are provided outside of the play areas. The host (which got a 18% gratuity) only assisted with handing out pizza slices and lighting candles. (We were not given a warning of when to be out of the room (I‚Äôm an adult and did not need this). She was late in announcing the party time start (which she offered to do). Im big on, if you say you‚Äôre gonna do it, do it so don‚Äôt make promises you can‚Äôt keep.

Review: Excellent concept for play. However, there were a few areas where the children were not visible and the lighting was dim. AmThe set-up ppears problematic for security purposes since they allow adults to access the play area with their ""kids."" It would be an improvement if they had better lighting and limited the areas where adults can access/jump & tumble with their ""kids"" within the children's ""safe"" play area so that we are assured that our kids are free to run and play in a well lit; in a properly supervised safe play area. We want to be able to see them play. Additionally,  I would suggest that there be a safe, separate space for parents who wish to play with their kids and a separate area where kids can be just kids - separated from ""well-intentioned"" parents. I would also suggest that strange adults not engage with other peoples children - I was VERY uncomfortable when I observed an adult collecting kids names and engaging with the kids in the play area. Paranoid? I am not - it would be great if we lived in a completely safe world - but we do not. Also, I would suggest a form of ID for parent and child, obvious security cameras, and someone posted at the door to ensure the correct adult leaves with the correct kid(s).

Review: I loved coming to Wiggle Giggle ! I had such a great experience with my sister. She loved it and the staff was wonderful! I don‚Äôt understand how rude people can expect a person who is doing their job to break the rules just for them. If there is a non refund policy , there really isn‚Äôt anything else a worker can do. They‚Äôre just following the rules plain and simple. Additionally, I find it offensive to compare such a great establishment to a chick fil a play area. Some people just have no common sense to understand that people are just doing their jobs and having an attitude doesn‚Äôt help anyone. Overall, Wiggle Giggle is a great establishment and will definitely recommend it to friends and family!

Review: A very overpriced and underwhelming play area. The staff has zero common sense and the company has no refund policy.

My 4yr old daughter played barely played for 15 minutes and there was another 3yr old boy who was misbehaving with her. There was no staff on the floor to supervise and the parent of the boy did nothing to stop her son‚Äôs bad behavior.

When we decided to leave and asked for a refund, the clueless manager said that they don‚Äôt do refunds. The other staff were also equally unhelpful and were arguing with us in an impolite tone. We told them that unfortunately we‚Äôll have to leave an honest review on Google but they acted as if they don‚Äôt care about it and said that we can go ahead and submit our review. So we left without getting any refund.

In summary, this place is not worth the money as I recently took my child to Boomerang in Atlanta for the same price and it was much bigger with many more activities and had better staff.

Don‚Äôt take your kids here! You‚Äôre better off going the Chick-fil-A with the free play area, 2 minutes ahead on the same street. For the same amount of money, you can get two meals and your child can have a peaceful play experience for free.

Review: I love wiggle giggle! I went to my nieces birthday party today and it was amazing to see it so packed full of people for a new business. The only other indoor play place I know that's for kids is Chuck E. Cheese or the trampoline park. Chuck E. Cheese is huge and sometimes I don't think it's the safest place for kids because literally anyone can walk in there. I like how wiggle giggle is smaller so wherever you sit you can pretty much see your kid if you pay attention to them. There aren't many hidden spots it's all right in front of you. I also like that wiggle giggle seems like it's for little kids. Other kid places always have much older and bigger kids running around trampling the younger ones. Wiggle giggle felt more little kid and toddler friendly. Staff is attentive and fast. I watched them clean out a birthday room for another incoming bday party. I like how mommy friendly it is with a place to breast feed your kid and has space for kids who are having a hard time with noise or behavior issues. I hope this place expands to more locations!

Review: This place exhibits a grossly negligent and apathetic approach to guest safety (and is unsanitary and not well maintained on top of all that). Despite recurring injuries in specific areas, they make no meaningful effort to implement preventive measures or improve safety protocols.

Instead of addressing the risks, they simply rely on a flimsy liability waiver as a legal shield‚Äîreopening hazardous zones without additional oversight, signage, or support. Their disregard for basic injury prevention reflects a disturbing prioritization of profits over people.

Quick cash grab for the owners.

Review: Most money hungry kids place I've been to. Took my 4yo to jump. They Tried to charge me for a baby under 1 to crawl on the floor in the toddler zone. They tried to charge me 3.09 for a cup of ice water. There is no free water or fountain. Management made up some joke story about not having insurance to cover a fountain and they pipe they're filtered water in.
The place is hot and dirty. I'm sweating on a rainy day, the floors are dirty and there was no soap in the ladies room.
The workers don't seem to care and wouldn't even help my 4yo carry her tube up the slide. They weren't even busy. There was a total of maybe 10 kids on the floor.
It seems like alot of the things are roped off and needing repair.
They are trying to nickle and dime people to death and offer as little as they can. Will not be returning.

I do not appreciate someone touching my child without my permission. Another employee stated that children have to wear flip zone socks due to their policy so they would not be sued but if I wanted to continue to let him jump then that would be up to me. I stated ‚Äú yes he wants to continue to jump‚Äù . She left and then someone else told me that I would need to purchase the socks and I stated I would like a refund because I just came in within the past month and these are the same socks ! Every time we go we were jumpy socks and I have never had any issues.

Review: Sorry in advance for the long review.
I went to this establishment with some friends yesterday for their sons birthday. While the kids were jumping my friend and myself went to get a snack. She purchased a frozen banana and I was in line to purchase mine when she opened hers and bit into it. My friend immediately had to spit out the piece of banana as it had gone bad and was partially melted. I asked if I could open mine up before purchasing and the girl reluctantly said yes. That one was also partially melted and you could tell it had melted and refroze before that as it looked like when a candy bar melts and you put it in the freezer. I obviously did not purchase the banana, but they offered nothing to my friend who had purchased hers. The staff then started going through the freezer and realized half of the freezer was defrosted and had to throw away all of those items on that side. Now food regulations are not my specialty, but I don't see that the other half of the freezers items could have possibly been at food grade temp. All of the items should have been disposed of in the freezer. After that we purchased cards for the kids to play the arcade/ VR games. When my son got on to one of the VR games he said he couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I thought maybe it hadn't taken the card and swiped it again. It had taken the money off the card, now 2 times. It was at this point a young lady came over (mind you this was like 4 or 5 minutes later) and I was saying that we had swiped it and the money came off twice and we couldn't figure out how to get the machine to work. She then proceeds to explain that is because she has to release it. Apparently she was supposed to be working that section and helping everyone with the VR games. She begins strapping my son in and when she straps his feet in he asks if the ride goes upside down. She replied yes and he said no he didn't want to do that, so she let's him off. No offer to put back on the money or anything. There were multiple people trying to get on the VR rides and no one knew that there was even an attendant for that area. The attendant did have time to constantly be on her phone though. Lastly the group of kids were waiting to go into the laser tag game. They were waiting for the group ahead of them to finish because there were small kids in that group and they were trying to be polite because we had older kids. The attendant told them they could wait for their turn to finish. Our group sat at the tables by the laser tag while the other group played. Another group came up and was standing at the door and once the first group finished the attendant proceeded to let that group in. When my friend approached him asking why he had done that and asked for the manager or owner they said he wasn't there. My friend said she had just seen the owner a few minutes prior. The attendant then said ""Oh you think just because he's Indian, he's the owner!?"" My friend then proceeded to tell him NO she had known he was the owner because earlier that's what he had told her. The staff here are rude and will be the downfall of this establishment.
1. There should be a sign that states there is an attendant that sets up all the VR games.
2. Signs should be posted on games that aren't working so that people aren't swiping cards and not getting to play said game. (I seem a few kids swipe their cards on a game in the VR section before the ""attendant"" let them know it wasn't working)
3. There should be a waiting list for the laser tag.
4. The staff should be taught about temperature regulations on the freezers and they should be checked daily.
5. Being rude to customers should not be tolerated when it is not called for.

Review: Dirty floors with half broken machines and rude staff. This is a hurry up and wait place. 30 min in line for and drinks and 25 min again in same line to sign up for Lazer tag. My lemon pepper wings were so salty I couldn't even eat them. The kids did enjoy the slushies and pizza. The wait to play Lazer tag was hell on earth at the end with sad kids who got skipped twice we ended up leaving without getting to play after waiting an extra 45 min . Save your money and peace of mind .

Review: The upkeep of this place is terrible. The floors are very dirty. The trampoline area needs to be swept and deodorized. The bathrooms are nasty and there‚Äôs never any soap or hand sanitizer. The workers are young and really don‚Äôt care about anything. This is a fun place but at this rate it will be falling apart soon.

Review: We recently visited Flipzone Trampoline & Fun Park and were thoroughly disappointed with the condition of the facility. We arrived at opening and noticed several spills in the main entryway and throughout the building, which appeared to be left over from the previous day. The overall cleanliness was very poor, making the environment feel unkempt and uninviting. Several of the game machines were out of order, further limiting the activities available.

After visually checking the space, we made the decision to cancel our party reservation due to the lack of upkeep. While the concept of the park is great, the lack of maintenance and attention to cleanliness made it impossible for us to proceed with our plans. We hope improvements are made in the future to better meet guest expectations.

Review: This place always disappoints us! My 4yo son loves the ticket/prize games the most at places like this, but they always only have half of those games actually working that he can play. The worst part is some will be plugged in with no sign that it's broken, and you won't find out until you tap your card and lose your credits. We added a bunch of credits several months ago but couldn't use any due to most not working, but we were told they couldn't refund us because it was run by a different company. We returned again to try to use our credits only to find that many machines still didn't work. Luckily, I was able to make the best out of it for my son so I don't have to come back. I will drive to Jacksonville for Dave & Buster's next time.

Review: Went there yesterday with a friend to play some laser tag thought we would do some VR before we went in the VR machine ate my money thought I only put $20 in there actually put $70 in there with zero credit and no gaming card. I reported the incident to the owner Which he walked over and said you‚Äôre not trying to scam me. Are you thinking I only put $20 in there. I told him I put 5 ones 1 five dollar and the 10 bills in there when actually I put 70 in there. Long story short He argued that I was trying to scam him, and I never put the money in there, which was the total lie. He‚Äôs not an upstanding man. I think I might go in today just to see if he counted the money and pulled the report to see that the money was over and will return me my money but as of now He‚Äôs not a upstanding man in my eyes. Which suck because there actually nothing to do in Brunswick.

There is so.much more than trampolines there. By far one of the best places to take kids. Arcade, virtual reality, laser tag, bumper cars, rock wall, velcro wall, zip line, and so much more.

Review: Kid has fun. Its a little pricey. There is more than just trampolines, which is kinda nice. But theres multiple locations in jax, too, that are just as diverse but not as picky. Just a simple water bottle will get you griped at. They are very wishy washy on what socks you wear. Some days any real jump socks are fine, some days it has to be a certain kind of socks. How do I know what socks to bring? The sock bit is a big con to get you to pay more. We have literally 15 different pairs of socks now between the 3 or 4 different parks because this particular one is too picky about them. No one we have been to in jax cares what color your socks are as long as they are real jump socks. I think I have griped about it enough now to have a permanent note on my phone and my hubs phone to not come back here and just stick to jax. Personally, theyre all about the same distance time wise, so there's no incentive to come here in particular.

Review: This place was okay, I guess. For $12 for my child I can't really complain. I'm not driving out of my way and here's why.

The toys were really beat up. A lot of them were broken and gunked up. Some of these inflatables were on the flat side. I was too worried of an injury to let my son go on.

There's a almost tree house looking area with a house at the top of stairs. This is crazy dangerous. One side has steep and sharp stairs. The other side is to climb up, but if someone falls it will be a serious injury.

Also, one area in the ball pit has the beam exposed without pad. It's a very small area, but that can cause a serious injury.

To me, this place isn't putting safety and cleanliness first. There seems to be a lack of care.

While it was a decent spur of the moment place when we were in town, I would not return here.

There‚Äôs a $40 service fee that was explained as a ‚Äútip‚Äù for the person attending. We were also told there were juice boxes included for the kids which we didn‚Äôt get. Not a huge deal but for the price we paid and the fact that we were charged $30 for a couple of extra kids that were there but were 8 month olds who didn‚Äôt even play, that was kind of annoying. The equipment to play on is fun and the kids enjoyed it. Overall it worked well for what we needed at the time but for $600, I wouldn‚Äôt do it again.

Management needs to invest in cleaning, repairing, and updating the equipment to bring it back to its former quality and make it safe for the kids. It was a really sad and disappointing visit since I had such great memories with my older kids. Only pro is that it‚Äôs not a massive indoor play area so you don‚Äôt have to run after your kids to find them.

Review: There are better options in the area. It's affordable, but it's small and does not appear that clean. Just take a quick look at the outside of the equipment and you will find it covered in dust.  Take a look at the windows near the wooden structure and you will find cobwebs.

Review: This indoor playspace was so clean and nice.  Socks are required for adults and kids.  There are benches everywhere for caregivers to sit and watch kids, the atmosphere is very very clean and organized, and the lady who operates the space is kind and friendly.  They are constantly upgrading existing play equipment and adding new features, and it's easy to watch your kids from nearly any part of the building despite it being a large space because of the setup.  Overall it's clean, inexpensive, and provided our family hours of fun on a hot afternoon.  Remember to bring socks and have fun!

Review: I went with a kid who cannot yet walk (13 months). This felt more like a pre-school instead of a play space (groups of little toys, some of them broken). The baby area was very small, just a 5ftx5ft fenced in area with lots of battery toys, so much so that I had to move things to have space to sit down.
There is a large climbing structure and blow-up obstacle course for older children. We didn't get a chance to try it out since it was rather busy that day.

They have everything from big slides to magna tiles. Also very important to note when we arrived everything was very clean. Some of the other places we have been were not as clean.

There is a bouncy slide that is off on its own. There are also several small spaces with benches and smaller play things if the kids want a break from the big stuff. It's also helpful for smaller kids. I believe there is also a VERY small enclosed space specifically for toddlers with toys.

I especially like it, because while there are so many different activities for the kids to stay entertained for hours, the place is fairly small and so it's easy to keep track of where your little one is at all times.

Not the worst place we've been to but not the best either as far as indoor playgrounds go.

Overall I was super impressed with the quality of Oodazu‚Äôs facility and staff - this will be our annual birthday spot for years to come!

Review: So many wonderful things to say about OODAZU! My son regularly attends camps here during Christmas break and throughout the summer so we decided to have his birthday party here last weekend. The staff is incredible with the kids and there are so many fun activities for them to do. We added a pi√±ata to his party and what a fun time had by all! They even have a balloon bar so we didn't have to bring them in from somewhere else. 1 stop fun shop! LOVE IT!

Review: WE LOVE OODAZU! We just had the best experience for my daughters 5th Birthday yesterday. We were so excited to FINALLY get to celebrate after 2 long years and OODAZU did not disappoint. The staff was friendly and loving to us and all of my daughter's friends. They all had so much fun and were begging to stay longer. I HIGHLY recommend OODAZU! And we were so excited to learn they offer camps throughout holidays and all summer long. I am going to sign my daughter up for summer camp today!

Review: I hesitate to ever give bad reviews, especially during these trying times, but Oodazu really dropped the ball on a birthday balloon delivery and wanted to give the heads up to anyone else ordering to make sure you call repeatedly. In early December I ordered a balloon delivery for a birthday in late December. On the birthday, no balloons arrived. I sent multiple text messages, but never got a response. I called at 11 am, and they told me it would be arriving after 1 pm. I called at 3 pm after no delivery had been made and left a message.  I got a call back after 5 asking if we still wanted a delivery later that evening. I said we were home, but still no delivery.
I understand being short staffed and unable to fulfill an order, but I don‚Äôt understand not giving the customer a heads up and soon as you realize this.  All this to say, if you order balloon delivery, call often to ensure you‚Äôll get what you ordered.

My kids loved the employees and are always excited to get there and play. In the past, experiences like this have been a bit pricey but Oodazu hits the perfect price point for a young working adult. I highly recommend this for parents in search of day camps and child care.

I see some posters here describing negative race-related issues and as a Hispanic-American I can say that nothing is further from the truth. We have always felt welcome and treated very well by everyone there and so have everyone else that I‚Äôve recommended. Absolutely love this place!

Review: I am highly disappointed in the Management at this place! They quote you whatever numbers they like, and it depends on the day. I've spoken with two persons, and I've gotten numerous answers to prices. For example, I was told that to move a table from one room to the next, it would cost $499, then I'd have to pay extra for balloons, and $150 for special decorations. When I originally called about the decorations I was told $50, then I was told $99, then I was finally told $150 for these same decorations which does not include balloons.
6 days after I paid my deposit, and sent out invites, and 5 days before the party, the owner sends me an email canceling. Who does that?
I've already purchased the kids' costume outfits, bought several things for the party, and this lady cancels because it's 'too close to the holiday.'

We requested to rent the location for $1750 for 5 hours ! They agreed to this deal. We did a walk through, we were satisfied. We sent out invitations to everyone. Less than 24 hour later. The owner calls and says They were not staffed enough for 12 children and ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù. He said insurance doesn‚Äôt cover 12 people in the building. We said we wouldn‚Äôt have alcohol.I explained to him that we didn‚Äôt mind sharing the space with other families. The only thing would be our Dj playing children‚Äôs music The owner kept giving excuses. FYI , the Saturday schedule is clear from 11am - close! I checked online and no one had booked for the day we wanted.The owner referred us to another kids play area, which we payed less and got a bigger place with more kids and only two Staff!

Review: This is among our very favorite kids' spaces! After attending an awesome birthday party at Oodazu, we decided to sign up for the after school sessions.

We had initially been hesitant - our young 4 year old daughter loves the playground, but is always reluctant to go down big slides, or get pushed too high (or at all) on the swings, and only likes bouncy castles when there are just a few tired kids left in there. She‚Äôs active, but VERY cautious, haha!

On her first day at Oodazu, she was inspired to climb/scale the walls and towers, had the energy to drag the tires up the huge slide (with the help of a friend), and clearly had an incredible time. Most impressive - she was in the most upbeat and positive mood after Oodazu (a level of cheerfulness that lasted all day and that doesn‚Äôt compare to her days with dance, tennis or swim classes, which she also loves).

The space is functional, and also modern and creative. There are a ton of activities to get kids moving and exploring - but without the chaos of the typical kids‚Äô indoor gyms/playgrounds. The staff are exceptionally warm and attentive - there aren‚Äôt many places I feel comfortable leaving my child, but this is one of the very few.

We tried the kids‚Äô yoga classes - we haven‚Äôt found anything like it nearby in Atlanta. The yoga teachers keep the kids engaged for 45 minutes (without parents!) in the very chill yoga studio, doing real yoga postures specifically for kids - while I couldn‚Äôt tear my eyes away from the screen outside in amazement. We‚Äôll be back often!

There are several climbing walls, a giant slide, huge foam ‚Äúbuildings‚Äù to climb. There‚Äôs virtual reality that the kids loved! The best part of it all is how well staffed they are. There‚Äôs someone at each station to help kids strap on their harness and get started with each activity. And if your kid needs to unwind, there‚Äôs yoga!! They have yoga classes for kids! There‚Äôs parent night out options! For birthday parties, they handle it all if you want them to. We showed up with a cake and that‚Äôs all. They supplied the decorations, balloons, food, paper products, even a candle and lighter! My only suggestion would be for them to invest in a couple of high chairs. It was slightly difficult for the babies to eat and for my 1 year old to do his smash cake. But, we managed. No biggie.

Review: I am SO happy this place exists in Maryville. It took a while to get there, but today I finally took my 6 year old son. He has autism and eloping is part of that. Parks, and open public spaces are a no go, because he will run. It is very limiting and keeps us from going most places.  Today we went here after school and he had such a great time. The play area was so perfect for him. He was able to run around free and he didn't stop for the nearly hour and half we were there. The play equipment was all really great. The bouncy slide area was his favorite but really enjoyed the regular slides too. I brought him home and for the first time pretty much ever, he sat down and relaxed. He was worn out. This place will become our second home and I am so thankful they were so accommodating. The prices were much lower than I had anticipated. Which is rare these days.  The ONLY complaint I have is not about this place nor the staff but about parents not watching over their children a bit better. But I guess that is the appeal. To bring your kids and get a breather from them for a second. Not everyone has children with special needs that require constant supervision, so maybe I'm jealous of their freedom. üòÇ Regardless I couldn't be more pleased with our first visit!

You can buy a day pass & if you need to leave, you can still come back that same day (as long as you have your receipt) and reenter without having to purchase for entry again. They have arcade games that are free. Snacks & drinks are available for purchase. The only true thing I would change about this place is that it would be amazing if they had a bigger space. But they definitely succeeded in making it a fun play area with the space they have.

There‚Äôs a 2 & under section which is nice for littles. They have a big obstacle course for bigger kids and other games. Bigger kids can get rough from time to time so i just take my little to the 2 & under area or where the little play kitchens are.

Review: My Family and I absolutely love this place! I feel like there is always something to do for everyone, especially littles. They are good about adding extra crafts or things to come and do around the holidays. I have never had an issue here and the staff is amazing and treat us like family when we come in. Birthday parties are reasonably priced which is a bonus. Always a clean and safe environment, and a wonderful way to make friends. I could go on and on about how wonderful this place has been to us, but once again we love this play store. *some pictures added are from the previous location*

Review: I love that they have this place available for children to play. That's very convenient.
For after school, or even during the day they will be moving to another area, so they won't be located inside the mall. Any longer
But with this new spot they need to make sure that they make it available for all ages, from babies and under 2 to the older children they need to be sure that they have these areas separated.
In order to make it convenient for the children and less worrisome for the parents.

I didn‚Äôt bring my 9 year old but I think he would enjoy the games and mats as well. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs perfect for ages from infant to about 7-8 year old.

Review: Great fun place for kids! My 8 year old always has a blast. The toy stations are frequently updated/rotated and the owners take extra care to keep everything clean.

I noticed another review that said there was no changing station, which is not true. This business has been around for nearly a year and a half and they've had a changing station in the back (next to the party room) since day 1. As for bathrooms: that's simply a function of being set up in a mall. There is a public bathroom very close by, and the owners have zero issues with customers having to step out briefly for that and then coming back in to play more.

The private party room is so spacious and able to seat SO MANY kids and adults. We had almost 40 guests and it never felt cramped or was hard to move around.

We got to use our own playlist and even had a glow party! Super affordable compared to so many venues. Best part: all adults were able to chat and mingle while easily supervising all the action and kids. The layout is easy to be able to see everything going on without being on top of your kids the whole time.

Cannot recommend this place enough! Book your next party there 10/10

Review: Brought my year old and four year old daughter to Maryville's Play Station in Foothills mall with the coupons they gave us during the trick or treat event. It was a nice gesture to hand out those passes. The girls absolutely loved it there. They loved the Pac Man video game, the kitchen set and the climbing equipment. The place is heavily padded and kept clean. It allows the girls to be social and play. There's lots of stuff to keep them stimulated and entertained. It's nice to let them cut loose and do their own thing. If you have kids I highly recommend you give it a try. As we all know scrubbing energy off your kids is a good thing.

First off there‚Äôs no a/c , there‚Äôs only like 2 staff, the mats are dirty as hell, everything is beat up and just filthy. $20 and I only stayed 30 mins if even that. The cafeteria is disgusting, I threw a plate away and millions of fruit flies were flying around. There was socks, gum wrappers, dirty napkins in the play area. The ball pit was DISGUSTING & lots of the balls were broken & flat. Please please pleaseeeee don‚Äôt take your kids here, you WILL be disappointed. I‚Äôm upset I didn‚Äôt read the reviews before going because they are not lying at all. 0 out of 10 .

Review: 2 years back, it was in awesome condition. But on Monday sep 02 went there, and I was shocked to see its condition. Too dirty , too messed up, most of the attractive swings for kid have been removed and the trampolines have been placed and those trampolines were also in too bad condition. This place needs lot of attention otherwise , this place is not a place to have fun there anymore.

06/16/24 got to visit and my son had an okay time. Absolutely filthy tho, good thing I'm not bothered by germs but this place was disgusting, falling apart and hot as the air conditioner wasnt great either. Broken toys, unsafe falling apart equipment and looks like it ain't got even a decent cleaning in 10 yrs let alone a deep clean. Absolutely the grossest indoor playground I ever seen and I won't be coming back. Shame on the owners, the kids of Norcross and surrounding areas deserve better than what I seen today! I was appealed by the shape this place was in.

Review: Very dirty but very fun if your okay with germs!! The mats are worn and the new (like from 2021) ninja course is not too fun for the kids but the big room with red carpets (I don't know what it's called) is quite clean. On one of the animal things that kids can ride around on there was blood on it which concerns me although I doubt something bad has happened there (just reporting and it was quite long ago so it might be cleaned). It's quite old and run down/ghetto yet besides the low quality quite fun if you don't mind it! The employees are slightly bratty and kids do prefer the old version of this place with the arcade but it's still keeping some attention but not all of it is positive. I believe maybe besides all of the negative things, if you go in with a positive attitude and ignore any grime or dirt then maybe it could be enjoyable. This place doesn't deserve one star because it's not completely terrible but it's ever so slightly dirty but I feel some people in the reviews are over exaggerating it a little bit. (I do now take negative criticism about this) Although the place looks like a middle school bathroom it has a lot of terrible things happening which I believe if they had at least a bit of cleaning they could get these reviews way up then now. I believe that maybe at least a bit of cleaning could do a lot for this place. Compared to how this place used to look it has changed a LOT, I used to be taken here when I was little and compared to now... It has changed for the worst and I doubt it will come out of this weird rabbit hole of dirt they have fallen in, and i don't think they are really trying to fix it because since like 2019 it has fallen into disrepair and I doubt it will come back into their prime. If a worker is reading this then please please please hire a janitor!! Hell I'll even do It for free!! I'll just walk in and clean It. This place has really changed and I see the possibility of this place being good if you cleaned it and took better care of it but I feel in a few years this place will end up like the old ajc building downtown, If you don't know what that is supposed to mean I'm saying that it will possibly go bankrupt. Sorry for the long review, I feel very passionate about this place. I wouldn't want to see this place go but it seems like now I have no choice but to watch it slowly decay.

Review: By far the most filthy and disappointing place I have ever taken my kids! Not only is it extremely overpriced but there were a ton of safety hazards. The trampoline had an old DETACHED ladder, the floor was so filthy that I told my kids we have to toss our socks in the trash, the equipment is extremely old and didn‚Äôt seem very sturdy, and a lot of the toddler electronics did not work. They also played their music from a laptop on YouTube and let all of the ads play through. If that‚Äôs not terrible, the owner turned the lights off on us at 8:55 when the place closes at 9. We spent $63 for absolutely nothing and will definitely not be returning.

Review: Arrived in the morning. Only one family was there. Paid $32 for two adults and two toddlers which was slightly pricy in my opinion, but no problem. The place was DISGUSTING. Like to a level where the health department needs to come out expeditiously. Candy was all over the floors. The mats were covered in brown dirt. Elements of the play area were falling apart. Dirty socks in the play area which clearly says it was not scanned from the previous day. We didn‚Äôt last five minutes before I requested a refund and left. (Moms of toddlers‚Ä¶ you know it was bad if I willingly disappointed my kids knowing they‚Äôd turn into velociraptors the minute I said we were leaving.) I‚Äôm grateful that the front desk employee gave me $30 back in cash and was polite, but that‚Äôs literally the only positive thing that I can say about this experience. For a facility geared to children, they should be ashamed of themselves. The CDC could use that place to source new bio hazards. Fix it Jesus. üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòñ

Mimi‚Äôs Jungle Gym is absolutely amazing! We booked a room for our child‚Äôs birthday party, and it exceeded all expectations. The value they offer is unbeatable compared to other kids‚Äô party venues. One of the best perks is having an assistant help with decorating and setup‚Äîit made everything so much easier!

The play area is incredible‚Äînothing else even comes close. We drove from the Knoxville area just for this, and it was 100% worth it. The kids had an absolute blast, and the facility was spotless. I was so impressed by how frequently they sanitized everything, ensuring a clean and safe environment.

Everyone loved the experience, and we will definitely be back. If you‚Äôre looking for the perfect spot for a kids‚Äô birthday party, this is it! Highly recommend!

Review: We have visited numerous of times, ( had a great time each time ) however today was hands down the BEST experience! They look the time to plan a special ‚ÄúBlippi Party‚Äù and the actor was TERRIFIC! The entire time his character had the best energy and personality! Kids swarmed him for nearly an hour and he was still jumping around, dancing, giggling and laughing! I was amazed!! I also encountered like 8 different staff members in my 3 hours there, all staff members were so friendly! They held conversations, helped push my child on the swings, and threw balls back and forth! One special staff member helped me corner my wild two year old just so I could video his reaction to seeing Blippi! So thankful to have such a great place near by to take my children!

Today, B had a play date and we toted Bear along. In true Bear form, he had a massive blow out ü´† andddddd we had nothing. Literally had four shirts in his bag and ZERO shorts. I was walking out to buy him a pair at Walmart and stopped to ask the sweet ladies at the desk if they happen to have a spare pair and that I would of course pay for them. They GAVE me a pair of shorts and told me it happens! No worries! Mom to mom, my heart is full. Moms running a business should be a superpower. We will continue to visit and cherish this gem in our small town!!! Thank you ladies of Mimi‚Äôs!!

For the first 2 visits, we had our water thermos and still purchased food here. **Water isn't going to cause a lack of profit.

Review: I had a great first visit last month. Brought our water thermos' and purchased sliced pizza for my kids later on. No problem at all.
Encountered a lady working and she never said a peep about our water cups that visit, or next, a week later. So, I purchased a pass for 10 visits since it was clean fun.

2nd visit- kids out of control, not much monitoring going on. I had to stop the banana swing with my 2 kids screaming because older kids were going too fast. Staff just stood there.
I had a pass, so decided to try a midweek day.

However, this visit has been an entire different encounter.
Myself and my kids were abruptly stopped after checking in, and told to put our water cups in the shoe bin, as they weren't allowed.

I get a business trying to make money and have rules for no outside food.
But it's not as though I'm bringing a bag of fast food. Nor, special drinks.
It's Ludacris that a water thermos isn't allowed. So, we all have to leave together,  go to lobby for a drink of water.

Water shouldn't be a 'luxury' that must be purchased , especially as people need to hydrate and already pay a decent amount to enter.
I see similar reviews mentioning that and I should have researched more.

After my pass visits are met,  we will resume going elsewhere. A water thermos and special diet snacks shouldn't be an issue.

I'm sure , like other parents, I'll have a passive response. So,   Poppets place here we come.

Review: I am extremely disappointed with the service that my disabled daughter received at this playground. We spent almost 30 dollars only to be inside 30 to 45 minutes. Let me start by saying I had to pay 6 dollars for my daughters nurse which is fine. However when people are complaining on your child that has down syndrome and the nurse and I never left her side but a parent made it seem like we were not around her which is completely inaccurate..My daughters nurse and I were with her 100 percent of the time and when my daughter scratched another child I personally apologized to everyone that was close to her.. I as well as her nurse was standing right next to her and got her of the swing immediately...To even insinuate that she was unattended is gross and unacceptable... Meaning that parent was no where near their child for them to even hear that I apologized to every adult.... Meaning the child was unsupervised....... I would not suggest bringing any child here with special needs including but not limited to down syndrome, autism, ADHD. Not to mention we drove an hour and half here..... I blame the ignorance of the parents as well as anyone else who doesn't understand the difficulty of having a special needs child.....
In addition to ""chastise"" me about my disabled daughter in front of other parents was completely unacceptable.... If there was any concern that should have been handled privately..... I left of my own free will because I felt that I wouldn't have been chastised publicly if I was a different complexion........ I'm am still very upset.... wish I read the Google reviews instead of the Facebook reviews honestly...... The reviews on Facebook are very misleading ...... It was a complete waste of time.... I ended up taking my daughter another 55 minutes away to chuck e cheese on Kingston Pike we had a blast! I was not going to let that ruin her day at all!!!! If you have a special child save your self and your child the heartache please üíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíï

Review: What a fun place for the kiddos!! Went with my mother, kids and nephew. They played for hours! The place was crazy clean and the attendants were super sweet. I am not a breastfeeding momma any longer, but just the fact that the jungle gym saved a space for those mommas warmed my heart.

My mom and I sat in the observing area, purchased some coffee (skinny syrup provided ‚ù§Ô∏è), watched the kids play and enjoyed some adult time! I have seen several reviews complaining of the attendants. The only time I saw them interrupt play was when kids were climbing up slides, being rough around the littles, etc. The rules are there for a reason and create a clean space for kids of all ages to play safely.

Review: This place is NOT kid or parent friendly at all. We were excited to find a local playground for our little ones and planned on coming often. However this place has the most ridiculous and unreasonable ‚Äúrules‚Äù.   Even though they have a designated place with chairs and tables, you can‚Äôt bring your own snacks! Not even for your two year old.  They sell chips, pizza and pepsi products. If your child has strict dietary needs, well you‚Äôre out of luck. They watch your every move and bark at kids if they break a rule. They also provide plastic shoe covers for parents to wear while in the facility. However, if you dare step your foot in the restricted area, you will be yelled at! Seriously?? After I walked in the restricted area WITH MY PLASTIC SHOE COVERS to help my child when he fell of the bike, I was rudely asked to leave. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I was never treated so rudely, or ever asked to leave a facility. I said I was not coming back, and to my dismay the rude older woman said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we have plenty of customers‚Äù.  Shocking.
By the way, if you happen to speak another language, BEWARE!! You may be discriminated against. Thats exactly how I felt that day. I know my rights. I‚Äôm sad we had such a bad experience in our local community.

Review: Drove from Maryville to Athens because we heard such good things about this place... Made sure to leave everything in the car as far as any water and snacks as previous reviews said they were very strict and couldn't even bring water cups in.... So thought we were all prepared... I would have totally given this place a 5 star rating as  the playground is amazing. My 3 year old had a wonderful time and it was very clean!! However What I didn't appreciate is they charge more on Fridays because of the day of the week which makes no sense to me  and they make adults pay for admission if there's more than one adult present... I would understand if this was a family venue where adults could interact with the child but this is strictly just kids playing.. and no other playground charges for the adults watching their children play. Everyone is having a hard time... And I get small businesses need our support but it's hard on parents to want to come back to a place when you think you are paying $12 for you kid and walk away with a $30 bill because you came on a Friday... cant wear normal socks, cant bring your own water, and if Dad comes hes extra too!

Review: There are definitely pros and cons to this place. But as a parent, the cons outweigh the pros.

PROS:
- My kid had a great time on the equipment.

CONS:
- The ‚Äúno outside food or beverage‚Äù rule is ridiculous. The indoor playground in Maryville (as well as the new one they‚Äôre putting in there soon) allows you to bring your own HEALTHY snacks and drinks. I asked to keep my water at least because I‚Äôm recovering from kidney surgery and they said a firm ‚Äúno.‚Äù
- You can buy their pizza, but it‚Äôs a $5.99 pizza from Dominos and they charge you $16 for a whole one, or you can buy 2 slices for the same price you could buy the whole pizza for at Dominos.
- There‚Äôs a young teen-ish boy who sulks about the ‚Äúlounge‚Äù area with a very unfriendly face and attitude about him, slamming chairs back into tables and making sure you‚Äôre not breaking any rules. I believe he is related to the owner.
- ‚ÄúMimi‚Äù or her husband come around and stare everyone down (again, not very friendly faces or demeanors) to make sure you‚Äôre not breaking rules.
- The ‚Äúlounge‚Äù area is plastic or metal chairs, and since you can‚Äôt bring ANY drinks or foods from home, you‚Äôre uncomfortable in many physical ways.
- You can‚Äôt step out to eat in your car and then return (which goes to show it‚Äôs not about keeping the facility clean or fair, it‚Äôs about GREED).
- They charged me for an extra adult even though it‚Äôs supposed to be one free adult per child. Wasn‚Äôt worth the trouble of dealing with the front desk to get my money back.
- We went opening day, and they were VERY lax on their rules. Came back a few weeks later, and the rules were strictly and rudely enforced. ‚ÄúMimi‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have a very friendly attitude and should stick to a career where she doesn‚Äôt have to talk to people face-to-face.
- Also I witnessed one of her younger grandkids (I am fairly certain) going into a private room with many ‚Äúoutside‚Äù snacks and drink, while a mom who was there with us said she was denied to bring her baby‚Äôs bottle and baby food in there. So I guess if you‚Äôre related to ‚ÄúMimi,‚Äù you don‚Äôt have to eat one of the few unhealthy options they offer, but if you aren‚Äôt, be prepared to spend plenty more money on food and drinks. Which I‚Äôm sure is the whole point.

That‚Äôs all. We went twice, and don‚Äôt expect to go back. Which I‚Äôm sure is the mutual feeling of many.

Review: The facility is decent, but you could get the same at a Chick-fil-a or McDonalds. When they first opened, you could bring food and drinks, because all they have is small snacks or drinks. This time, not only could you not, they were very rude about it. We were treated like common criminals. They told us we could order a pizza. Then she sent her husband to Dominoes and Upcharged us $16 for a $5.99 pizza. One mother had a special needs baby who had to have special food. She wasn't allowed to bring it. That poor momma had to pay for a full day but stay only a couple of hours before having to leave to feed her baby. You can't even go to your car and eat or they will recharge you for a full visit when you come back inside. The seating for parents is hard and miserable. If your children are above toddler age, you can't see them play because they are in the back behind the toddler area. Should have been side-by-side so everyone can be seen. We were given dirty looks the whole time we were there by staff. We won't be back!

Review: Kid friendly place not so kid friendly or friendly at all. I recommend reading so you don't get in trouble as I did.

Cons.

1. No healthy snack options(nothing kosher, for diabetics, or for kids with allergies)
2. Kicking out without warning
3. Banning you from coming back.
4. Talking to kids instead of parents if there's an issue.
5. It's not a place to relax while kids play. You're being watched for every mistake. And then you get kicked out.
6. Not for parents with multiple kids.

Pros
1. A nice playground for kids under 4, I'd say, and for those with 1 or two children the most.

I was so happy when they opened such a fun place in town. We planned to come once a month at least. I even asked for a multiple visit pass that they offer that day. However, for the 1st time in my mom life of 14 years,  I was kicked out of the place for bringing healthy snacks with us.  This was on our second visit to the Mimi's.
On our first visit, we noticed almost every single family using their own water bottle for both kids and adults, so I thought that was sweet of staff to allow. We also brought our own water and healthy snacks because after looking at their options on Facebook, I couldn't call them snacks but junk. Go check for yourself. Staff didn't tell us anything, and they saw us eating and drinking. We had a great experience. We loved it. I've got 3 kids ages 6-13 plus an infant.
On our second visit,while I breastfeed a baby,I noticed an older lady(staff) came to my older daughter and her friend's table and was talking to them in a very serious tone. I came to them and asked if everything was ok. She said :""yeah,I just told them no outside snacks or drinks."" I told her you guys don't have healthy options, so we had to bring our own. She said our rule is no outside food or drinks period. And left. Ok,we hid the snacks, and the kids went back to play(my younger ones weren't there). Then, once again,I'm breastfeeding a baby, and my 7 year old grabs a grape from a backpack and goes towards the playground and I called her and said no food on the playground. Once I'm done breastfeeding, I head towards kids, and the older lady approaches me and says you guys need to leave. And not come back again. You break our rules. Mind you,she never told us before if we break the rule again,we'll have to leave. No warning. And plus she said,someone overheard me calling her "" b**ch. I was shocked. English is not my primary language. My friend and I was talking to each other in another language, plus, I never ever swear. Never. And I told her that. I said let me also explain to you about the snacks. She said I don't want to talk about it,and please don't come back, and left. I wanted to tell her that kids' pediatrician recommended my kids to eat healthy snacks to restore their guts and I cannot feed them sugary drinks and candies. Plus if you pay $12 per child(with multiple children it adds up),you'd like them to stay a bit longer then 1 hour and kids loose a lot of energy playing there and need a snack. However, they don't allow you to go to your car, eat and then come back. If you go out,you leave. And if you bring your own, you get kicked out without warning.

I LOVE that the staff cleans the equipment throughout the day AND that they have monitors walking the playground making sure kids are being safe and following the rules! I find that to be so helpful to parents, especially of multiples! Speaking of rules, there aren't many to follow (mostly common sense) but I appreciate the ""only socks in the playground area"" as it definitely helps keep it clean. Upon arriving, I noticed the ""no outside food or drink"" signs on the front door and a few other areas (which is no different from other play places we have been to), but their snack bar definitely makes up for that! Lots of options for both drinks and food. From soda, chips and candy for a little treat to water, string cheese and applesauce for a more healthy snack! Overall, I can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy this place! Go check them out, you won't regret it!

Review: We stopped by because we were curious as to what the new business was in our community and what a surprise.
The room is mostly a giant sandbox with wonderful toys, colorfully painted walls, super clean environment and a wonderful area for parents or caregivers to sit and watch their children play. Its a giant sandbox with plenty of toys and room for lots of children. There's even a standing kinetic sand sandbox in one of the side rooms.
What a perfect alternative to being out in the hot sun or this winter when it's too cold or rainy days. Or to even have a birthday party. I wish something like this had been around when my children or granddaughter was young.

The kids enjoyed sensory play, and the dads had a good time too. The service was excellent. Even our 14-month-old babies, who haven‚Äôt been to a real sandy beach yet, had a wonderful experience.

Review: I have been searching for a close-by, quiet, sensory-friendly indoor playspace for my two young children, and I believe we have finally found it! We spent over two hours here, loved playing in the sand and all the diggers they had, and the two large kinetic sand sensory bins in the quiet rooms to the side were perfect for my littles for a sensory break. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. Check it out!

Review: My 22m old had the BEST time today at Isaac‚Äôs Sandlot! The staff is so friendly and kind. The space is clean, calm and relaxing. No screens. No music blasting. Just sand, trucks and fun! We were surprised to learn they also had kinetic sand, fluid sand and remote control trucks. Plus‚Ä¶the cutest Mural on the wall featuring local landmarks like the Frosty Caboose! Clearly a lot of thought was put into making this an awesome space for kids and parents. I am so excited that this opened in Chamblee. We will be back often!

Review: We had such a fantastic time here! My son spent two hours happily playing in the sandbox, which is packed with tons of toys. There are also some cozy chairs for us parents to kick back and relax in while we watch the fun. After all that playtime, there's a wash station to rinse off the sand. Plus, they have a great selection of kid-friendly snacks for purchase to enjoy!

We‚Äôre visiting the area and decided to stop by as walk-ins on a Thursday around 4 PM. Although they asked if we had a reservation (we didn‚Äôt), the place was empty so they kindly let us in. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. My 3-year-old had a blast and was able to play independently for quite a while. Most importantly, everything was very clean and well-organized.

Review: Highly recommended, a must-see place for small children. Two hours of experience. The facilities simulate shops in a variety of professions, for example a pizza shop where the child wears a coat and receives baker's equipment in the oven and operates the shop, including making a simulated pizza with all the equipment.. An immersive experience and all the children really love being here. Highly recommended.

Review: I've been to this place a couple of times, and overall, I like it. I think it's clean, nice-looking, and excellent for kids.

However, the girls at the front desk have consistently come across as unfriendly and hard to communicate with. Each time I've visited, they've tried to charge me for an infant who is still being carried. I've had to ask every time what age children start paying, and their response is always, ""does he crawl?,"" which my baby doesn't do yet.

I've also felt watched or stared at in a way that made my visit uncomfortable.

To the management: your employees are the face of your business. First impressions matter.

Review: Super nice setup! I mean it is absolutely amazing and interactive for children. BUT, PLEASE BE CAREFUL when booking for birthday parties or events. They charge you a high amount of money for ‚Äú2 hours‚Äù worth of play but it‚Äôs really not even a whole 2 hours before they‚Äôre telling you that you have to exit the party room. Within 1.5 hours I was forced to set up, sing happy birthday, feed my guest, and then basically leave. For the amount of money that was spent, I deserved a whole two hours. The manager was super nonchalant, she literally just wants your money to fund her next nail set and wig. Nice play for children tho, just book regular play time if anything.

Review: The parking area was interesting. It's almost like driving in to an alley. If I went based off of that we would've left. But I'm glad that we didn't. My little had a great time. The space was compact but had a lot to offer. My daughter enjoyed playing at all the pretend businesses. She was a little older than most of the children there at 7. I think 7 or 8 is the perfect age limit. If your 7 or 8 year old is aggressive please keep in mind that there will be lots of babies that they will have to be gentle around. We paid for the non skid socks online. But when we got there we didn't not receive non skid socks. They were normal Fila socks, so the non skid doesn't seem to be enforced at this time. It wasn't too slippery though other than the Beautiful marble-looking bathroom. Please go with your little people to the bathroom.  Overall it was super fun and I would recommend it.

Review: Great idea for a play area for kids but his place was very chaotic. Too many people at once, I don't see the point of the time schedule that you book if they book a lot of people at the same time.  No one--kids, parents, or staff--were putting things back so it was very unorganized; the only staff there were the two that were helping people check in. It was hard to play with things because you didn't know if a kids was still playing with somethings or if was available for another kid to play with.   Complete disordered, very stressful.

I had no idea where the kid‚Äôs parent was or I would‚Äôve said something to them about their bully of a child. That‚Äôs another thing..the older kids‚Äô parents don‚Äôt watch them.

The ""Avenue"" is interactive and entertaining for kids. They can play for hours in the various shops. Kids learn how to share, be patient, and stay organized amongst other good values.
The place is constantly kept clean and neat.
There are nice restrooms in the area.
Parking is tough, as there are limited spots, but the turn over is high so spots open up quickly.

The front check in area is small and crowded. Parking was a NIGHTMARE. And parents are supposed to be monitoring their children... But they weren't. When there's a birthday party/event, they should limit guest #. I was squeezing around more parents that were standing around  than little kids. This size of the toy/play areas is best for 3 years old and younger. The school aged kids need to find somewhere else to play! They were destructive, wild and pushy. My little 1.5 year old could play on much without getting knocked around or toys snatched from him or pushed away from the little cars by the older kids. I won't be back.

Review: We booked Kids Avenue for our daughter‚Äôs Birthday Party. The kids loved playing in the different play areas, and had a great experience overall. Our concern is with the owner and the lackluster offerings for the birthday parties. It was very expensive, and not worth the cost. When we booked the party we knew that we wouldn‚Äôt get much, but wanted to book because our baby loved it during our visit.

The staff was nice, but lacked alignment on exactly what we were to receive during our time there. Upon booking, we were told that juice boxes for each child would be included and that they help with setting up, etc. The staff helped with setting and clean up, but gave varying explanations on the juice box issue. After paying almost $700 for a party; I expect to get everything that is stated to be apart of the package. We paid for 15 kids, and they attempted to give us a half opened package of 6 juice boxes. After complaining, a staffer left to get more juice boxes and attempted to then give us a box of 10, and take back the 6. The owner tried to explain by saying they no longer offer this as a package incentive. He also did not want to give us the juice. Seemed to me, that he was the only person aware of the policy change. BOTH bathrooms in the property were broken, and there were guests with toddlers scrambling to find a bathroom across the street. When we brought this up, he was very unapologetic about the overwhelming inconvenience.

This review is NOT about $5 juice boxes; it‚Äôs the lack of integrity from the owner. If this was offered during booking; then honor it. If the bathrooms don‚Äôt work; apologize to your customers and assist them in finding a solution. The party package is too expensive to receive nothing but the runaround‚Ä¶the allotted time is also too short, but it‚Äôs doable, since most of the kids opted to play instead of eating.

Review: Staff at the check in desk were very rude and not helpful at all. It was my first time there with my baby and they assumed I knew all the rules and prices of everything without explaining how the entry to the play area worked. When asking questions they seem reluctant to answer. Aside from one of the staff members Ron who was very polite and informative the other two girls at the desk just didn‚Äôt seem to care. If they don‚Äôt have patience to be around children or have customer service skills with moms or especially new customers then don‚Äôt work there. Also the website is very misleading I read that babies who don‚Äôt walk aren‚Äôt charged an entry fee however I still got charged because they said that‚Äôs if it‚Äôs a sibling that doesn‚Äôt walk. No where on the website it clarifies that. Once we were in after what seemed like a long time the play area is very beautiful and looks clean. My 9 month old had so much fun even though she only crawls for now she stilled enjoyed the different play shops.

Review: I emailed the company this after my daughters party but did not get a response. I just didn't want to surprise them with my review.

We were not provided capri suns for the children although that is a part of the booking, nor did we receive assistance with the setup. This is very disappointing as we not only watched them help the party coming in after us but was rushed out 15 minutes prior than our end time.  The party is way to expensive for two hours to not come with the bells whistles and capri suns [ literally $5 worth of juice]. Of course I was overprepared so my daughter's party did not suffer. Nothing special was done for our birthday girl by your facility and that is just lackluster. For $800 you should try to do more to make the party feel special.

The party to play window is not long enough for the kids to eat and play, they pretty much had to choose which one they will do. You should consider 1.5 hours in the party room and additional time for the kids to play after to allow parents time to feed their children and sing happy birthday to whoever's party it is.

It is way too hot in the party room and bathroom, you guys needs to have HVAC come assist with that, it makes the short time in there with a group of people miserable. And if its too hot right now in the winter it will be too cold. The facility is nice despite it being small, the parking lot is an absolute terror! Someone hit a car leaving out twice while we were there.

The kids tables in the party should be cleaned so that disposable table cloths don't show the writing all over the tables, it looks cheap, doesn't match the venue's aesthetic and there is no party cheaper than $550. My kids as well as their cousins and friends usually have fun here but party vs play time will prevent me from booking another one.

Review: I had a birthday party here and I was not satisfied with my visit. The manager was very rude along with the other staff members. I ended up paying over $800 for this birthday experience for my two yr old. Although the facility was very nice and fun for the kids, the staff needs to work on their customer service skills.

If you‚Äôre only planning on staying one hour I recommend going the second hour of the blocks. About half the people start to leave and it was less crowded then.

Review: I was disappointed with this place. To start, the parking lot is really rough, and the staff was not professional. They were venting about their boss while I was trying to check in and they pretty much ignored me while was holding a baby and my toddler was getting impatient. The toys were never organized or put back in its place, making it hard to enjoy the pretend play. The changing station of the restroom did not work properly and I couldn‚Äôt secure my baby. I would not have been able to use the restroom if it wasn‚Äôt because I was there with a friend. The changing station should be inside the bathroom stall so that the adult with the baby can use the restroom. This is the kind of thing that a place created to entertain children should have.
As a positive, there were nice pretend play areas with a lot of potential to be a great place if they fix some things.

Review: Great indoor play space! It's pretty small but well utilized. All of the equipment was functional with nothing broken. The facility was clean. I like all of the ""real"" elements like names of local businesses as shops. There's not much adult seating, so caregivers have to occupy play equipment to sit on. Id say the age range is more like 1-5 years.

There was no seating at all besides the ones in the front entrance which is outside the play area. If I was the owner,  I would remove all the climbing stuff in the middle and replace it with comfortable lounge chairs.

The staff was friendly, attentive, and professional, making sure that the children were not only having fun but also learning and staying safe.

My daughter Lucie loved it so much she stayed 3h. $25 a kid. No fee for parent. Don't forget grippy socks. Otherwise $4 a pair. No food or drink is sold, so he sure to pack your kid a snack.

Review: Not the best place in person. The pictures online look nice but its deceiving, as it was very very small and narrow on the inside. Toddlers may like it because it's not much play area but for middle aged kids I wouldn't recommend this place. I feel like the prices  are a bit high for what you get definitely not worth it at all !, and why pay for grip socks if the kids can't jump anywhere. Also false advertisement on pit ball room, game room and virtual reality that was not there !!!

The place itself is a hidden gem‚Äîspotlessly clean and thoughtfully designed with activities for all ages. There were plenty of fun options to keep older kids entertained, while the youngest ones had a blast in their dedicated play areas. It‚Äôs rare to find a venue that caters so well to such a wide age range, and this one nailed it!

Review: We learned about this place from my friend and she came across a instagram post about the venue collaborating with Ms. Shay for a ‚Äú Parent Help Parent Support Group‚Äù this particular event was  dedicated to children with special needs from 6pm-8pm. I saw the post and called right away and asked how I could purchase the ticket.  I purchased my daughter ticket over the phone for about $13 and they asked if I completed the waiver and said no, so the manager said she will stay on the call while I completing the waiver and texted me the receipt and confirmed the waiver was complete.  Calling ahead definitely made the process swift . I was very pleased to hear about this event and discovered a new place to take my daughter for her own enjoyment. I make it my mission to travel to kid friendly places to figure out what she likes and let her be a kid. I love the inclusivity of children with special needs. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about anyone judging my child or any child.  My child would be free and I could watch her in peace.

Fast forward to the day of the event, we were welcomed by Ms. Nella and Ms. Shay and the staff.  My  daughter immediately took off her shoes and went to play. That‚Äôs a plus , usually new environment are hard adjustment for her especially with unfamiliar people. This establishment is great for the kiddos. This place offers video gaming , tutoring, snack bar. The indoor playground was designed with the kids in mind. I love the rock climbing wall,  ball pit , slide , obstacle course , trampoline, projector and screen with kid friendly videos and music. It‚Äôs a great place to let the kids enjoy themselves. Additionally, they offer to watch your kiddo if you have a date night or just need time to yourself for a flat fee and trust me the price is very reasonable. Please inquire about it. It was a great experience overall. This place was very clean. I highly recommend this place! I can‚Äôt wait to come back.

Review: **Fantastic Experience at the Grand Opening!**

I had the pleasure of attending the grand opening of Fun Time and I was blown away by the experience. The space is beautifully designed, catering to different ages and interests. Whether your child loves active play, video games, or needs some extra help with tutoring, this place has it all!

Overall, Fun Time is a wonderful addition to the community. Whether you're looking for a fun place for your child to play, engage in educational activities, or enjoy some screen time in a healthy environment, this is the place to be. Highly recommended!

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly.

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

Review: This place is great for dropping off kids when you have to run some errands etc!!! It felt welcoming the moment I walked through the door. I had a sense my daughter would be safe and enjoy playing here while I took care of some things. As a single mother, I get nervous leaving my daughter but I felt extremely comfortable letting my daughter play here for a few hours. The prices were reasonable!!! The staff were helpful and nice!  They have a secure systems for drop off/pickup. I had access to cameras to see her incase I wanted to peek in on her. I definitely will utilize their services again. 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è

Review: I am so grateful that this service exists in Houston County! This is a need in this county and the owners fulfilled this need. This is a must for parents who could use a break from parenting responsibilities for a few hours. Thank you for taking such sweet care of my boy tonight while I was at a work related function. He had such a great time and he‚Äôs already ready to return. We are looking forward to using you again for all our future date nights and/or work events. I could not ask for a better service, especially when not even most daycares in the area provide live access to cameras. That alone shows the integrity that Drop n‚Äô Play provides to parents.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I wish you all the success in this niche of a business!

It‚Äôs clean, safe, and suitable for younger kids. I didn‚Äôt take a picture of the pricing, but I will update my review when I go back! I paid $10 for 30 minutes of play. I do know it was $7 for 10, but you definitely get your money‚Äôs worth. When your time is up the attendant will let you know, just in case you get behind schedule. Also, you‚Äôll need to sign a waiver. Thank you for the great customer service and a good time!!!

Owners are nice and they have cleaning supplies on site. $7 for one hour in the playpen and $7 for 15 minutes on the animal mobiles. Only gave 4 stars because some things are starting to get old.

Review: Birthday party planning was a breeze! I contacted the owner through Facebook messenger,  I was able to pay through an app. The atmosphere of the play room is great and there's a variety of activities for kids of all ages. The owner gave me 30 minutes before the party to setup in the party room, and we reserved the party room for 3 hours. The kids enjoyed playing in the playplace during the 3 hours we had scheduled. Would definitely recommend to friends!

Hyperkids in Ashburn is an absolute gem for families, especially on days when you need a fantastic indoor activity! As an indoor playground, it truly stands out as a vibrant, safe, and incredibly fun space for children to burn off energy and engage their minds.

We have thoroughly enjoyed each event. They have been well thought out with cute decorations, themed music, and activities. It's well worth the money for events since they get to play for 2 hours, have a snack and drink, and enjoy themed activities. Play Matters has been clean and tidy every time we have been and the owners are so kind and caring. If you're ever curious Play Matters, go check it out!

Review: Too expensive for the amount of money spent. You don‚Äôt even  spend that much at a carnival. I don‚Äôt know if the prices change depending on events but don‚Äôt feel I really got a bang for my buck spending  35$ especially for Easter the rooms were alright just a little bland I felt it could‚Äôve been much more also set up like a daycare. Not much room for an active 3 year old. For 35$ to be told to also clean up behind your children for everything they play with is absurd. Please get better pricing for events. More than likely will not return to this business

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Everything is always very clean and organized. My toddlers love coming here, and I like being able to sit down while they play.

We also had my 2 year old's birthday party here. There is a nice party room where we had food and decorations. I loved that they put my birthday girl's name on their sign next to the words ""happy birthday."" It was such a nice touch. The staff was very helpful. It was perfect for all my little girl's little toddler friends. Everyone had so much fun. It was a special and memorable birthday party for sure.

Review: I wanted to give PlayMatters 5 stars, because the concept is wonderful and creates so much excitement for learning and engagement for little ones. My biggest con was you cannot control how other families will appreciate the space and often times they will leave one room a complete mess. So while we were entering our next room; the kitchen area the prev. family left it completely messy and the owner thought it was us, so he starts cleaning while my daughter is still playing, I move rooms to allow him to fix up and to explain to him its okay because she still wants to play. Nope, he continued to clean and even get a bit frustrated because my child would pull out toys as he was cleaning. Now we felt rushed and not wanted. And maybe that was not his intention, but it did sour my mood and make me not want to visit again.

Review: Adorable, cute play place! So many Lovery and Montessori toys, it's every aesthetic mom's DREAM. I wish it was my house. However...

sadly...its not an great place for  energetic  or autistic children.

The environment is very calm and quiet. I felt like we were in a library and every noise we made was embarrassing. I wish they played some light music.

Also, every room is self-enclosed. I have two kids, and it was impossible to see where both kids are at once. This place is designed for moms with only one small child.

The biggest thing though, was I did NOT feel it was a safe enough for any kid who tends to run away (elope).

My autistic 3 year old loves to open and shut doors as ""fine motor stimulation"". Most kids go through a phase where they like to open and shut doors. Thusly, there needs to be child locks on EVERY door, inside AND out. There were over 10 times that my kid opened the door and ran for the street before I could even get to them!

I want to come back, but I felt stressed, flustered, and disappointed by the end. Please consider all children. If you update with inclusive safety measures, we will be a regular customer.

Review: My four year old is super into toy cars and he really liked the room with them. I wouldn‚Äôt call it an indoor gym type of place, so in that way it‚Äôs a little different. It‚Äôs for younger kids and has a lot of emphasis on imaginative play. I highly recommend.

Review: Great addition to the community for families with children aged 0-5. I was so impressed with the set up, the toys, and the owners who are so kind and welcoming. I was surprised even my 4 month old had toys catered to her developmental age! So much thought went into creating this amazing space for littles.

Edited to add: we hosted our daughter‚Äôs 3rd bday party at PlayMatters and they did a beautiful job with the decorations and preparations for our party (we did the add-on decoration package for the party). Very responsive in planning and brought all of my ideas to life for the perfect party. We love PlayMatters!

Review: My 22 month old daughter absolutely loves Play Matters! There is a wide variety of toys & climbing equipment for infants & toddlers. We frequently visit Edventure, but Play Matters is much safer and appropriate for toddlers. The separation of rooms helps to control crowds. The organization and labeling makes it super easy to clean up after yourself. We HIGHLY recommend bringing your under 5 year old kids to Play Matters!

Review: So happy to have discovered this great place!  So fun and affordable,  clean and well ran.

Love the variety of toys and things to play with. Definitely Montessori style toys which is great, love all the natural materials.

Every room has a theme, everything is labeled to make cleaning up easy. Twonof the rooms are for 18 months and you ger.

Almost every room has a seat specificly for adults. Two rooms that I've been in didn't have one. But one of the rooms  had some short stools that work if you cant sit on the floor.

Appreciate the kitchen area to sit and eat snacks, one visit they even had snacks set out for guests. They have 2 single stall bathrooms and a nursing room.

Remember to wear your socks, but if you forget - you can buy a pair from them.

We've been coming every week after PT appointments, makes the trip to Lexington even better =)

Really wish we had a place like this in Sumter! Even my 16 yr old had a great time.

Review: My children were very excited to go here and I always enjoy supporting small businesses. The place is a nice size, not too big, and perfect for toddlers. Everything is clean and organized. However, I noticed the owner does not like clutter of any kind. She frequently followed us around and would put toys back in their assigned spots when my children were still playing with them. All the toys are labeled and the owner expects that toys should be put back in the exact location that she wants them. There are multiple rooms that have adorable themes, but the toys in each room are not to leave. This was a bit frustrating. It was difficult to enjoy playing with my children because I felt like I had to cleanup after them the entire time. I was hoping this would be a relaxing experience but it was the complete opposite for me. I also enjoy keeping things tidy and had no plans to leave a mess behind. My kids are asking to return but I'm not sure I want to go back. To the owner, your business has so much potential but kids need to be kids. They will make messes, it's part of how they play and learn. I hope this feedback is received well and that your business continues to flourish.

Review: We had our son's birthday party here and it was awesome! We upgraded our package and they decorated everything for his party! All we brought was the cake, some snacks and goody bags. The kids had a great time- there is something for all of them. I especially appreciate the baby area for the little ones. My 17 month old loved the ball pit and her big brother played in there with her! The giant jumper in the middle was a huge hit with every child! The older ones loved climbing and bouncing. The staff was very friendly and helpful! After the party ends, we got to stay and play up until closing time which I thought was awesome. All of our guests got free passes to come back. The women's restroom has a changing table and rocking chair in it! I appreciate the space while doing diaper changes and loved the option to sit and nurse if we needed privacy. Can't wait to take the kids back here! My son said it was the best birthday party ever! :) :)

It was a Saturday so it was a little crowded but I cant wait to check this place out during the week when no one is there! Definitely a new favorite. It was only $6 for my son & I think that's a completely fair deal for as much that's here!

Review: It was a wonderful facility for children to play.  Just a great variety of experiences.  The only problem I had was, you must remove your shoes before entering the play area and I am medically unable to do that.  They give you shoe covers but, they barely fit over my size 14's.

Review: Prices were very reasonable but the overall condition of the play features was representative of the cost.  A few of the arcade games took our money, but the staff quickly resolved the loss.  Other than that, kids had a blast and did so at a good price compared to others.  Billy beez, across the street in the mall, would have cost our family $70, at Everland total cost was just over $20.

Review: Staff was friendly and theres lots of things for kids to do, but the place needs some improvement. The foam tiles were installed incorrectly so your littles will be tripping. At the end of a slide is a ball pit, unfortunately there are very few balls and the pit itself is falling apart. Black electrical tape holds the dirty yellow foams together. Theres another slide on the other side that you better watch out for...its too steep and my little could've popped his arm out of the socket if I wasnt close by. Even the rope bridge was in desperate need of repair.

Also, the temperature of the building was too warm. We had to go outside to cool down.

There is a small game room inside where you can insert special coins, play games, collect coupons (?) and exchange them for toys.

As always, kids love a playground :)

Only annoying thing is adults who get inside of the inflatables when there are signs that state not to. Also, people who don't keep their small toddlers in the toddler area. Kept getting worried that one of my older kids would hurt a little one while bouncing.

Every request was granted, kept the flow of my party well organized. I added an extra hour and asked to change a few things and that was done without a problem. I noticed it was very warm in the building. I mentioned it to one of the employees and he stated he had to text his boss to adjust it. This is Georgia heat for god sakes. After about an hour and half of being hot of being hot ,a couple more complaints , and a birthday cake that was falling apart due to the heat. The air conditioning was finally adjusted. The customer service was great for a kids place so I would def have another party here.

Review: On 5/11/2019 There was vomit in the ball pit and the employees didn‚Äôt even clear the ball pit out. They got their cleaning supplies together and gloves on while my child and another child were in the ball pit. Then they came over and looked for the vomit, still without clearing the ball pit. I took my child out and asked what it was they were looking for. They wouldn‚Äôt tell me what they were cleaning it for. I asked another employee who told me that the ball pit had been vomited in. Disgusting and terrible customer service/customer care. Children vomit and that wasn‚Äôt the problem. The problem was the necessary steps and precautions were not taken. What is most important is the lack of concern for the safety and health of my child! Honestly the place has gone downhill anyways and I typically go to kids up or billy bee‚Äôs across the street. I‚Äôm not sure why I stopped here today and won‚Äôt again.

Review: Horrible experience for my son's 1st birthday. Inside is pretty broken down. The floors are dirty and smells like a dirty mop was used to clean it. Play area had old, damaged toys. The foam squares from the foam pit are old dirty and torn; only the red ones were clean and new. This place needs a good cleaning and to invest in new flooring and some new attractions n toys. Very unimpressive considering this is a place for kids. We spent only about 20 minutes because I didn't want my son touching anything; especially not the floor. I wish I could have gotten my $8 back. Will not go back or recommend anyone take their kids here.

Review: This is a really fun place to bring the kids on a rainy day. I like that they had a little bit of everything - trampolines, slides, inflatables, etc. I also really appreciate the fact that adults don't have to pay to be here because, really, we're not here for our entertainment, right? I do think their seating for the snack area could be arranged a little better - they also need to offer napkins and stuff (you can't sell ice cream and then not have stuff to clean it up with) but overall, it's a fun place. We also got a smokin' deal on a Groupon package for here that couldn't be beat so I really recommend checking for a Groupon if you're bringing more than 1 or 2 kids.

Review: It's clean and the sound level is good, but the foam floor is coming up in several places creating a trip hazard. The play area netting is broken in many areas which makes it possible to climb out on top of the structure. Best for ages 7 and under.

Review: I stopped by with my grandson to  inquire about birthday parties and for him to play. He‚Äôs 2.5
We got there at 1040am. The doors were shut and wouldn‚Äôt open it looked deserted but the sign said open at 10am. So i got my phone out and called. A young girl answered and said ‚Äú i guess we‚Äôre having trouble with the doors. She came out and waited for us.
It stunk when we walked in, but we paid and i let the boy play. Well the only things he could play on were slides and play ground. All the rideable inflatables are broken.  She said water damage and a parent knocked one of the boxes off. The foot cars have no steering wheels, or batteries to make the sounds.
The bathroom floor is sticky and gross.  The rubberized flooring is buckled in a lot of places making it easy for kids to trip and fall.
Needless to say i won‚Äôt be asking about any Birthday parties here.

Review: My son is about 2.5 years old and loved this place.  It was very affordable, cool ac, snacks were reasonable, staff was nice.  My only complaint was a few things looking a bit old and beat up but that wouldn't stop me from coming back.  The inflatables did leak a bit making one of the two not really useable.  The playground structure was sturdy enough for a 250lb man to get into and supervise.  Overall a great experience and great value

I had the wonderful opportunity to have the assistant manager Ina be my party organizer and she was amazing. The level of professionalism of the entire staff as absolutely shocking. I even came the day before to look at the place and ask lots of questions. Michael gave me the tour and pointed out everything I needed to know and more. He was really sweet and knowledgeable. They did an amazing job with making the party go as smoothly as possible. They assisted me though the entire day as promised and our daughter had the time of her life. I would definitely say that this place was well worth our time and money on every level. To the owner: your staff is wonderful!! :-)

We were in first thing Sunday morning and immediately noticed the nasty thrash outside so wasn't a pleasant appearance.  Also the restrooms hasn't been clean the log stated last time was Sat at 6pm!  Attempted to grab some water from the fountain and it didn't work. You can tell they don't wipe or spray everything when they're close. I'm assuming the employees don't make as much and simply don't care or take shortcuts. Alot of the toys were run down saw alot of duct tape used.  Guess for $7 and all day play this is what u get.After my niece finished, we all scrubbed our hands.

Wife had to check the door to confirm, It was open. The inside looked great though!!! Daughter got injured on the merry go round bicycle thing that has no pedals, they need to put padding on it to minimize injures.

Review: Ok place, nice options for my one year old. Concerned about the older children darting all around and possibly knocking her down. But the lower rating comes from the fact that the A/C is inadequate for a space of this size. It was as if they were conserving for their bill or needed to have the unit serviced. When it‚Äôs 90 in Georgia and people are paying their money to be somewhere, we deserve air conditioning. It‚Äôs dangerous for children to be running, playing and exerting that type of energy without proper ventilation. It‚Äôll only take one person to pass out for this place to have a lawsuit on their hands.

Review: Amazing! Not only is it a lot of fun for the kids, but it's so clean! The staff seems to be constantly cleaning. They have great sitting space for adults even areas with outlets. I could have totally brought my laptop to get some work done had I known. We came in on a Thursday late afternoon, there was a good size crowd, but not crowded. I imagine weekends might be a little insane.
The music volume is great too. Feels like a lot of these places keep the volume up so high and it becomes stressful with the children's volume mixed in.
Food - while I wasn't planning on buying food here, the toddler decided he was starving. Luckily we can when they were rubbing a promo for $1 personal pizza for kids so it worked out. And the pizza wasn't too shabby, nothing gourmet. But for a place like this, it was decent. They also have a wide selection of snacks, coffee, and other eats for a fair price.
Price - reasonable for the area. And adults are free (or included) so that's nice, it feels less price gaugey. But if you don't want to eat here, there's plenty of restaurants around to choose from.
They do birthday parties as well and with a summer baby, this sounds like a great option. Not having compared party rates, not sure how they measure up here.
The staff is VERY friendly. They clearly enjoy their job here.
Parking- it's in a shopping center, so plenty of parking.

Overall, highly recommend. Thanks to my neighbor for checking it out first and telling us we HAD to come check it out for ourselves!
We will definitely be returning regularly.

They offer both daily admission and membership options. If my grandkids weren‚Äôt in school, I‚Äôd definitely go for the membership‚Äîit‚Äôs a much better value.

Review: I attended a birthday party for my nephew this evening, and it was everyone‚Äôs first time. Firstly, the establishment was clean & well organized. Secondly, the staff was exceptionally accommodating. From the front desk, to the dining area. Monte, who worked over the counter in the dining area, was so courteous and hard working despite having a busy line. Adara, who assisted us with the party room, was so helpful and pleasant. Lastly, the manager, Lamar, was extremely helpful, kind, and warm. We are all so thankful for the staff for making the birthday party a great time. I recommend anyone to go, the kids had a ball!

Review: Catch Air Tucker is a fantastic spot for kids to burn off energy and enjoy imaginative play in a safe, vibrant environment. The facility is clean, colorful, and filled with interactive play areas that cater to a variety of age groups. From slides and climbing structures to ball pits and light-up floors, there‚Äôs never a dull moment.

The staff is friendly and attentive, and safety protocols are clearly in place, which gives parents peace of mind. It‚Äôs also a great venue for birthday parties or group outings, with organized spaces and plenty of seating for adults to relax while keeping an eye on the action.

Whether you‚Äôre visiting on a weekday or weekend, it‚Äôs an energetic, family-friendly experience that keeps kids engaged and active. Highly recommend for a fun, screen-free day of play!

The General Manager was wonderful‚Äîfrom the moment I booked the party and we had our first conversation, he was an absolute pleasure to work with. Meeting him in person on the day of the party made it even better.

I really appreciated how the staff consistently cleaned while the kids played. This is by far the best Catch Air location I‚Äôve been to. The entire staff was kind, friendly, and attentive. I will definitely be coming back again!

Review: My kiddo is 4 and we got the membership. Everyone is SO friendly and it is kept clean. There is only one thing that I would love it if they would change. They have a wonderful projection room and my kiddo loves to dance around in there to the many interactive themes like, butterflies, stars, lava, trees. Today we were dancing and all of a sudden it switched to a giant scary skeleton and screeching sounds and it was upsetting to her and honestly me too. I don‚Äôt understand why this would be a theme for a young kids play space. I could see it if it was skewed to older kids but its more for kids 10 and under. Its kind of sad because my kiddo was having the best time and expressing themselves and now they are afraid to go back in there.

Review: Best Catch Air experience yet! The woman working at the front desk who checked us in, I believe her name was Nicki or Vicki, gave us an incredibly warm welcome.  Her customer service was exceptional! What I loved the most about this location was the fact that there were multiple employees on the floor at ALL TIMES with hand held vacuums and mops (similar to a swiffer wet jet). The cleanliness of this location, while understanding it's still brand new, was pristine and it was definitely because of that.  This is the third Catch Air location we've been to in the greater ATL area, but this was the only location I've seen cleaning up in real time.

Outside of that, the place itself is AWESOME and is now my 3 year old's new favorite Catch Air location.  But caution on those slides, they are SLICK because of how new they are and my 37 pound kid (and myself) went FLYING out of them (equal parts hilarious, entertaining, but also nerve-wracking). The outer space theme was so much fun, our favorite part being when they turned off the overhead lights and just let the colored lights do their job. We spent 3 hours here and not once did my kid get bored.  Can't recommend this place enough, so much that we plan on booking my daughter's 4th birthday party here!

Review: Late post but I had never been to a kid's play attraction grand opening Before until last sunday....if you have little ones up to like 10-12yrs old, u must go and check out Catch Air Tucker (in same plaza as Goodwill and Jason deli and our fav spot to eat KPOT Korean BBQ & Hot Pot ) ...it was amazing, not over crowded, perfect size ...toddler area is right next to the Big kid area but if u got a little one u want to keep up with like we do then get ready for a workout bc You Will be going inside all the attractions with them, we Will definitely make this a monthly visit and can't wait until they have memberships available soon ...

Pros: great location and size, colorful attractions for all ages, prices are $13-$20 for 2& up, 1 yr old free with sibling, every family has an unique hand stamp that Will be checked to make sure parents are leaving with the right child Before they unlock gate for You to exit, friendly staff, always cleaning the whole Time, everyone has to wear socks and take off their shoes(Even parents) and make sure it's grip socks because have some slick √°reas..also you can leave and come back later in day just show ur stamp again and the Best part as an parent... 1 free parent entry per paid child and only $5.99 each for extra adults( I used to hate going to other places and they want parents to pay same price as kids just to watch their kids have fun..smh)

Cons: Even though the bathroom was Nice and clean, as having an Autistic son, we didnt like the fact that the hand dryer for your hands is builded into the faucet, should be separate or at least at some paper towels inside bathroom as other option to dry your hands

The large pizza for $12.99 is not a pizza place type of large it's more like a medium size but was good and worked for what we needed at Time(food for kids to eat while we ate at Kpot afterwards)

Don't assume a child age just by looking at them bc got overcharged bc they assumed my youngest was already 3 and he is not so had to get a refund or put it towards the snack bar √°rea cr√©dit.

Nevertheless, both kids had a bowl on our family Day outing after church and then hubby and I got to eat at Kpot.

Review: Birthday party planning was a breeze! I contacted the owner through Facebook messenger,  I was able to pay through an app. The atmosphere of the play room is great and there's a variety of activities for kids of all ages. The owner gave me 30 minutes before the party to setup in the party room, and we reserved the party room for 3 hours. The kids enjoyed playing in the playplace during the 3 hours we had scheduled. Would definitely recommend to friends!

Great for rainy days or something to get out of the house. *Just a side note for those with chemical sensitivity, it has a very strong smell from febreeze which if you've done your research can be an endocrine disruptor and mess with hormones* My 3 year old had fun though!

I had the pleasure of meeting friends there to learn how to play pickleball. I saw 6 courts, there might be more. Saw a walking track above us. Going to return this week and plan to see what else is offered in the rec center.

Review: We had the absolute BEST experience hosting our little one‚Äôs first birthday at Romp-a-Roo!

From start to finish, everything was seamless, thoughtful, and beautifully executed. Audrey went above and beyond with the d√©cor‚Äîevery single detail matched our Wonderland theme perfectly. From the balloons and backdrops to the table runners and themed play areas, it truly felt like stepping into a storybook. Even our guests (yes, including the dads!) were commenting on how detailed and magical everything was!

The space was clean, safe, and full of fun‚Äîfrom a ball pit and obstacle course to interactive play stations and an inflatable bounce area. It was a dream setup that let the kids play freely while the adults relaxed and enjoyed the party. All we had to do was show up and set out the food‚Äîeverything else was handled with care and creativity.

I cannot recommend Romp-a-Roo enough for your next party or celebration. It‚Äôs rare to find a venue that feels this personal, welcoming, and well-curated. Thank you, Audrey, for making Chloe‚Äôs ONEderland celebration so incredibly special‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to return!

I have a daughter who will be back there more often and my older is turning 2 next month though we‚Äôve been in that area multiple times when the bigger kids come in and kind of take it over. It‚Äôs a 50/50 problem though, parents please watch your children and make sure they are following it and employees make sure to remind parents if you see a big kid there otherwise 10/10

Review: This place exhibits a grossly negligent and apathetic approach to guest safety (and is unsanitary and not well maintained on top of all that). Despite recurring injuries in specific areas, they make no meaningful effort to implement preventive measures or improve safety protocols.

Instead of addressing the risks, they simply rely on a flimsy liability waiver as a legal shield‚Äîreopening hazardous zones without additional oversight, signage, or support. Their disregard for basic injury prevention reflects a disturbing prioritization of profits over people.

Quick cash grab for the owners.

Review: Most money hungry kids place I've been to. Took my 4yo to jump. They Tried to charge me for a baby under 1 to crawl on the floor in the toddler zone. They tried to charge me 3.09 for a cup of ice water. There is no free water or fountain. Management made up some joke story about not having insurance to cover a fountain and they pipe they're filtered water in.
The place is hot and dirty. I'm sweating on a rainy day, the floors are dirty and there was no soap in the ladies room.
The workers don't seem to care and wouldn't even help my 4yo carry her tube up the slide. They weren't even busy. There was a total of maybe 10 kids on the floor.
It seems like alot of the things are roped off and needing repair.
They are trying to nickle and dime people to death and offer as little as they can. Will not be returning.

Me and my son were harassed from the time we went enter and I left within 20 -30 mins ! An employee picked up my son to look at his socks after I stated his socks have the grips on the bottom! I do not appreciate someone touching my child without my permission. Another employee stated that children have to wear flip zone socks due to their policy so they would not be sued but if I wanted to continue to let him jump then that would be up to me. I stated ‚Äú yes he wants to continue to jump‚Äù . She left and then someone else told me that I would need to purchase the socks and I stated I would like a refund because I just came in within the past month and these are the same socks ! Every time we go we were jumpy socks and I have never had any issues. I was told different information each time and that is unacceptable.It‚Äôs very unfortunate that my son could not enjoy his time and we had to leave early and I was denied my refund !!

Review: Sorry in advance for the long review.
I went to this establishment with some friends yesterday for their sons birthday. While the kids were jumping my friend and myself went to get a snack. She purchased a frozen banana and I was in line to purchase mine when she opened hers and bit into it. My friend immediately had to spit out the piece of banana as it had gone bad and was partially melted. I asked if I could open mine up before purchasing and the girl reluctantly said yes. That one was also partially melted and you could tell it had melted and refroze before that as it looked like when a candy bar melts and you put it in the freezer. I obviously did not purchase the banana, but they offered nothing to my friend who had purchased hers. The staff then started going through the freezer and realized half of the freezer was defrosted and had to throw away all of those items on that side. Now food regulations are not my specialty, but I don't see that the other half of the freezers items could have possibly been at food grade temp. All of the items should have been disposed of in the freezer. After that we purchased cards for the kids to play the arcade/ VR games. When my son got on to one of the VR games he said he couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I thought maybe it hadn't taken the card and swiped it again. It had taken the money off the card, now 2 times. It was at this point a young lady came over (mind you this was like 4 or 5 minutes later) and I was saying that we had swiped it and the money came off twice and we couldn't figure out how to get the machine to work. She then proceeds to explain that is because she has to release it. Apparently she was supposed to be working that section and helping everyone with the VR games. She begins strapping my son in and when she straps his feet in he asks if the ride goes upside down. She replied yes and he said no he didn't want to do that, so she let's him off. No offer to put back on the money or anything. There were multiple people trying to get on the VR rides and no one knew that there was even an attendant for that area. The attendant did have time to constantly be on her phone though. Lastly the group of kids were waiting to go into the laser tag game. They were waiting for the group ahead of them to finish because there were small kids in that group and they were trying to be polite because we had older kids. The attendant told them they could wait for their turn to finish. Our group sat at the tables by the laser tag while the other group played. Another group came up and was standing at the door and once the first group finished the attendant proceeded to let that group in. When my friend approached him asking why he had done that and asked for the manager or owner they said he wasn't there. My friend said she had just seen the owner a few minutes prior. The attendant then said ""Oh you think just because he's Indian, he's the owner!?"" My friend then proceeded to tell him NO she had known he was the owner because earlier that's what he had told her. The staff here are rude and will be the downfall of this establishment.
1. There should be a sign that states there is an attendant that sets up all the VR games.
2. Signs should be posted on games that aren't working so that people aren't swiping cards and not getting to play said game. (I seem a few kids swipe their cards on a game in the VR section before the ""attendant"" let them know it wasn't working)
3. There should be a waiting list for the laser tag.
4. The staff should be taught about temperature regulations on the freezers and they should be checked daily.
5. Being rude to customers should not be tolerated when it is not called for.

Review: Dirty floors with half broken machines and rude staff. This is a hurry up and wait place. 30 min in line for and drinks and 25 min again in same line to sign up for Lazer tag. My lemon pepper wings were so salty I couldn't even eat them. The kids did enjoy the slushies and pizza. The wait to play Lazer tag was hell on earth at the end with sad kids who got skipped twice we ended up leaving without getting to play after waiting an extra 45 min . Save your money and peace of mind .

Review: The upkeep of this place is terrible. The floors are very dirty. The trampoline area needs to be swept and deodorized. The bathrooms are nasty and there‚Äôs never any soap or hand sanitizer. The workers are young and really don‚Äôt care about anything. This is a fun place but at this rate it will be falling apart soon.

Review: We recently visited Flipzone Trampoline & Fun Park and were thoroughly disappointed with the condition of the facility. We arrived at opening and noticed several spills in the main entryway and throughout the building, which appeared to be left over from the previous day. The overall cleanliness was very poor, making the environment feel unkempt and uninviting. Several of the game machines were out of order, further limiting the activities available.

After visually checking the space, we made the decision to cancel our party reservation due to the lack of upkeep. While the concept of the park is great, the lack of maintenance and attention to cleanliness made it impossible for us to proceed with our plans. We hope improvements are made in the future to better meet guest expectations.

Review: This place always disappoints us! My 4yo son loves the ticket/prize games the most at places like this, but they always only have half of those games actually working that he can play. The worst part is some will be plugged in with no sign that it's broken, and you won't find out until you tap your card and lose your credits. We added a bunch of credits several months ago but couldn't use any due to most not working, but we were told they couldn't refund us because it was run by a different company. We returned again to try to use our credits only to find that many machines still didn't work. Luckily, I was able to make the best out of it for my son so I don't have to come back. I will drive to Jacksonville for Dave & Buster's next time.

Review: Went there yesterday with a friend to play some laser tag thought we would do some VR before we went in the VR machine ate my money thought I only put $20 in there actually put $70 in there with zero credit and no gaming card. I reported the incident to the owner Which he walked over and said you‚Äôre not trying to scam me. Are you thinking I only put $20 in there. I told him I put 5 ones 1 five dollar and the 10 bills in there when actually I put 70 in there. Long story short He argued that I was trying to scam him, and I never put the money in there, which was the total lie. He‚Äôs not an upstanding man. I think I might go in today just to see if he counted the money and pulled the report to see that the money was over and will return me my money but as of now He‚Äôs not a upstanding man in my eyes. Which suck because there actually nothing to do in Brunswick.

There is so.much more than trampolines there. By far one of the best places to take kids. Arcade, virtual reality, laser tag, bumper cars, rock wall, velcro wall, zip line, and so much more.

Review: Kid has fun. Its a little pricey. There is more than just trampolines, which is kinda nice. But theres multiple locations in jax, too, that are just as diverse but not as picky. Just a simple water bottle will get you griped at. They are very wishy washy on what socks you wear. Some days any real jump socks are fine, some days it has to be a certain kind of socks. How do I know what socks to bring? The sock bit is a big con to get you to pay more. We have literally 15 different pairs of socks now between the 3 or 4 different parks because this particular one is too picky about them. No one we have been to in jax cares what color your socks are as long as they are real jump socks. I think I have griped about it enough now to have a permanent note on my phone and my hubs phone to not come back here and just stick to jax. Personally, theyre all about the same distance time wise, so there's no incentive to come here in particular.

Review: This place exhibits a grossly negligent and apathetic approach to guest safety (and is unsanitary and not well maintained on top of all that). Despite recurring injuries in specific areas, they make no meaningful effort to implement preventive measures or improve safety protocols.

Instead of addressing the risks, they simply rely on a flimsy liability waiver as a legal shield‚Äîreopening hazardous zones without additional oversight, signage, or support. Their disregard for basic injury prevention reflects a disturbing prioritization of profits over people.

Quick cash grab for the owners.

Review: Most money hungry kids place I've been to. Took my 4yo to jump. They Tried to charge me for a baby under 1 to crawl on the floor in the toddler zone. They tried to charge me 3.09 for a cup of ice water. There is no free water or fountain. Management made up some joke story about not having insurance to cover a fountain and they pipe they're filtered water in.
The place is hot and dirty. I'm sweating on a rainy day, the floors are dirty and there was no soap in the ladies room.
The workers don't seem to care and wouldn't even help my 4yo carry her tube up the slide. They weren't even busy. There was a total of maybe 10 kids on the floor.
It seems like alot of the things are roped off and needing repair.
They are trying to nickle and dime people to death and offer as little as they can. Will not be returning.

I do not appreciate someone touching my child without my permission. Another employee stated that children have to wear flip zone socks due to their policy so they would not be sued but if I wanted to continue to let him jump then that would be up to me. I stated ‚Äú yes he wants to continue to jump‚Äù . She left and then someone else told me that I would need to purchase the socks and I stated I would like a refund because I just came in within the past month and these are the same socks ! Every time we go we were jumpy socks and I have never had any issues. I was told different information each time and that is unacceptable.It‚Äôs very unfortunate that my son could not enjoy his time and we had to leave early and I was denied my refund !!

Review: Sorry in advance for the long review.
I went to this establishment with some friends yesterday for their sons birthday. While the kids were jumping my friend and myself went to get a snack. She purchased a frozen banana and I was in line to purchase mine when she opened hers and bit into it. My friend immediately had to spit out the piece of banana as it had gone bad and was partially melted. I asked if I could open mine up before purchasing and the girl reluctantly said yes. That one was also partially melted and you could tell it had melted and refroze before that as it looked like when a candy bar melts and you put it in the freezer. I obviously did not purchase the banana, but they offered nothing to my friend who had purchased hers. The staff then started going through the freezer and realized half of the freezer was defrosted and had to throw away all of those items on that side. Now food regulations are not my specialty, but I don't see that the other half of the freezers items could have possibly been at food grade temp. All of the items should have been disposed of in the freezer. After that we purchased cards for the kids to play the arcade/ VR games. When my son got on to one of the VR games he said he couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I thought maybe it hadn't taken the card and swiped it again. It had taken the money off the card, now 2 times. It was at this point a young lady came over (mind you this was like 4 or 5 minutes later) and I was saying that we had swiped it and the money came off twice and we couldn't figure out how to get the machine to work. She then proceeds to explain that is because she has to release it. Apparently she was supposed to be working that section and helping everyone with the VR games. She begins strapping my son in and when she straps his feet in he asks if the ride goes upside down. She replied yes and he said no he didn't want to do that, so she let's him off. No offer to put back on the money or anything. There were multiple people trying to get on the VR rides and no one knew that there was even an attendant for that area. The attendant did have time to constantly be on her phone though. Lastly the group of kids were waiting to go into the laser tag game. They were waiting for the group ahead of them to finish because there were small kids in that group and they were trying to be polite because we had older kids. The attendant told them they could wait for their turn to finish. Our group sat at the tables by the laser tag while the other group played. Another group came up and was standing at the door and once the first group finished the attendant proceeded to let that group in. When my friend approached him asking why he had done that and asked for the manager or owner they said he wasn't there. My friend said she had just seen the owner a few minutes prior. The attendant then said ""Oh you think just because he's Indian, he's the owner!?"" My friend then proceeded to tell him NO she had known he was the owner because earlier that's what he had told her. The staff here are rude and will be the downfall of this establishment.
1. There should be a sign that states there is an attendant that sets up all the VR games.
2. Signs should be posted on games that aren't working so that people aren't swiping cards and not getting to play said game. (I seem a few kids swipe their cards on a game in the VR section before the ""attendant"" let them know it wasn't working)
3. There should be a waiting list for the laser tag.
4. The staff should be taught about temperature regulations on the freezers and they should be checked daily.
5. Being rude to customers should not be tolerated when it is not called for.

Review: Dirty floors with half broken machines and rude staff. This is a hurry up and wait place. 30 min in line for and drinks and 25 min again in same line to sign up for Lazer tag. My lemon pepper wings were so salty I couldn't even eat them. The kids did enjoy the slushies and pizza. The wait to play Lazer tag was hell on earth at the end with sad kids who got skipped twice we ended up leaving without getting to play after waiting an extra 45 min . Save your money and peace of mind .

Review: The upkeep of this place is terrible. The floors are very dirty. The trampoline area needs to be swept and deodorized. The bathrooms are nasty and there‚Äôs never any soap or hand sanitizer. The workers are young and really don‚Äôt care about anything. This is a fun place but at this rate it will be falling apart soon.

Review: We recently visited Flipzone Trampoline & Fun Park and were thoroughly disappointed with the condition of the facility. We arrived at opening and noticed several spills in the main entryway and throughout the building, which appeared to be left over from the previous day. The overall cleanliness was very poor, making the environment feel unkempt and uninviting. Several of the game machines were out of order, further limiting the activities available.

After visually checking the space, we made the decision to cancel our party reservation due to the lack of upkeep. While the concept of the park is great, the lack of maintenance and attention to cleanliness made it impossible for us to proceed with our plans. We hope improvements are made in the future to better meet guest expectations.

Review: This place always disappoints us! My 4yo son loves the ticket/prize games the most at places like this, but they always only have half of those games actually working that he can play. The worst part is some will be plugged in with no sign that it's broken, and you won't find out until you tap your card and lose your credits. We added a bunch of credits several months ago but couldn't use any due to most not working, but we were told they couldn't refund us because it was run by a different company. We returned again to try to use our credits only to find that many machines still didn't work. Luckily, I was able to make the best out of it for my son so I don't have to come back. I will drive to Jacksonville for Dave & Buster's next time.

My family has been to many jump parks in Jacksonville and none of them are as great as this one. We will definitely be back.

Review: Went there yesterday with a friend to play some laser tag thought we would do some VR before we went in the VR machine ate my money thought I only put $20 in there actually put $70 in there with zero credit and no gaming card. I reported the incident to the owner Which he walked over and said you‚Äôre not trying to scam me. Are you thinking I only put $20 in there. I told him I put 5 ones 1 five dollar and the 10 bills in there when actually I put 70 in there. Long story short He argued that I was trying to scam him, and I never put the money in there, which was the total lie. He‚Äôs not an upstanding man. I think I might go in today just to see if he counted the money and pulled the report to see that the money was over and will return me my money but as of now He‚Äôs not a upstanding man in my eyes. Which suck because there actually nothing to do in Brunswick.

Review: Place is not kept up. Staff in toddler area are RUDE. Not one of the pits are even half full of balls OR foam. 1 main jump area got a hole in it leading to directly to the ground/they wrapped caution tap around 1 pole and didnt stop ANYONE who jumped in because they didn‚Äôt see ‚Äòclosed‚Äô. Dont waste $$ - just a ER visit and BILL gained. If they didn‚Äôt have a waiver signed they would be sued

There is so.much more than trampolines there. By far one of the best places to take kids. Arcade, virtual reality, laser tag, bumper cars, rock wall, velcro wall, zip line, and so much more.
This place is top notch. I'd gladly take the kids again.

Review: Kid has fun. Its a little pricey. There is more than just trampolines, which is kinda nice. But theres multiple locations in jax, too, that are just as diverse but not as picky. Just a simple water bottle will get you griped at. They are very wishy washy on what socks you wear. Some days any real jump socks are fine, some days it has to be a certain kind of socks. How do I know what socks to bring? The sock bit is a big con to get you to pay more. We have literally 15 different pairs of socks now between the 3 or 4 different parks because this particular one is too picky about them. No one we have been to in jax cares what color your socks are as long as they are real jump socks. I think I have griped about it enough now to have a permanent note on my phone and my hubs phone to not come back here and just stick to jax. Personally, theyre all about the same distance time wise, so there's no incentive to come here in particular.

Review: My family and I have been here countless times for birthday parties and we even hosted our daughter's party here which was seamless and incredibly easy to book/plan. The staff are always friendly and the young man who managed the party for us was attentive and checked in multiple times. Our last visit included a couple of VR games courtesy of the owner and it made my son's weekend. When he was upset the ride was over they kindly allowed him to try it out again. Thank you for the fun!

The pits had a good bit of trash and there was quite a few springs uncovered in the trampoline area. The toddler area was over run with kids well over 5 and it made me very nervous to really let my kids freely play. We made the best of it and will be back but hope for better order in the future! üôÇ

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

Review: This place exhibits a grossly negligent and apathetic approach to guest safety (and is unsanitary and not well maintained on top of all that). Despite recurring injuries in specific areas, they make no meaningful effort to implement preventive measures or improve safety protocols.

Instead of addressing the risks, they simply rely on a flimsy liability waiver as a legal shield‚Äîreopening hazardous zones without additional oversight, signage, or support. Their disregard for basic injury prevention reflects a disturbing prioritization of profits over people.

Quick cash grab for the owners.

Review: Most money hungry kids place I've been to. Took my 4yo to jump. They Tried to charge me for a baby under 1 to crawl on the floor in the toddler zone. They tried to charge me 3.09 for a cup of ice water. There is no free water or fountain. Management made up some joke story about not having insurance to cover a fountain and they pipe they're filtered water in.
The place is hot and dirty. I'm sweating on a rainy day, the floors are dirty and there was no soap in the ladies room.
The workers don't seem to care and wouldn't even help my 4yo carry her tube up the slide. They weren't even busy. There was a total of maybe 10 kids on the floor.
It seems like alot of the things are roped off and needing repair.
They are trying to nickle and dime people to death and offer as little as they can. Will not be returning.

Review: I have been here numerous times before and have even invited friends and family but after this experience today we will not be back. Me and my son were harassed from the time we went enter and I left within 20 -30 mins ! An employee picked up my son to look at his socks after I stated his socks have the grips on the bottom! I do not appreciate someone touching my child without my permission. Another employee stated that children have to wear flip zone socks due to their policy so they would not be sued but if I wanted to continue to let him jump then that would be up to me. I stated ‚Äú yes he wants to continue to jump‚Äù . She left and then someone else told me that I would need to purchase the socks and I stated I would like a refund because I just came in within the past month and these are the same socks ! Every time we go we were jumpy socks and I have never had any issues. I was told different information each time and that is unacceptable.It‚Äôs very unfortunate that my son could not enjoy his time and we had to leave early and I was denied my refund !!

Review: Don't get me wrong, it's a nice and fun place, but when entering into the VR section you're being followed by an associate that stands 5 feet behind you. Makes you feel unwelcome. Been watching the area for 30 mins and anyone that enters is followed the same and never plays. I'm sure other patrons feel the same.

Review: Sorry in advance for the long review.
I went to this establishment with some friends yesterday for their sons birthday. While the kids were jumping my friend and myself went to get a snack. She purchased a frozen banana and I was in line to purchase mine when she opened hers and bit into it. My friend immediately had to spit out the piece of banana as it had gone bad and was partially melted. I asked if I could open mine up before purchasing and the girl reluctantly said yes. That one was also partially melted and you could tell it had melted and refroze before that as it looked like when a candy bar melts and you put it in the freezer. I obviously did not purchase the banana, but they offered nothing to my friend who had purchased hers. The staff then started going through the freezer and realized half of the freezer was defrosted and had to throw away all of those items on that side. Now food regulations are not my specialty, but I don't see that the other half of the freezers items could have possibly been at food grade temp. All of the items should have been disposed of in the freezer. After that we purchased cards for the kids to play the arcade/ VR games. When my son got on to one of the VR games he said he couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I thought maybe it hadn't taken the card and swiped it again. It had taken the money off the card, now 2 times. It was at this point a young lady came over (mind you this was like 4 or 5 minutes later) and I was saying that we had swiped it and the money came off twice and we couldn't figure out how to get the machine to work. She then proceeds to explain that is because she has to release it. Apparently she was supposed to be working that section and helping everyone with the VR games. She begins strapping my son in and when she straps his feet in he asks if the ride goes upside down. She replied yes and he said no he didn't want to do that, so she let's him off. No offer to put back on the money or anything. There were multiple people trying to get on the VR rides and no one knew that there was even an attendant for that area. The attendant did have time to constantly be on her phone though. Lastly the group of kids were waiting to go into the laser tag game. They were waiting for the group ahead of them to finish because there were small kids in that group and they were trying to be polite because we had older kids. The attendant told them they could wait for their turn to finish. Our group sat at the tables by the laser tag while the other group played. Another group came up and was standing at the door and once the first group finished the attendant proceeded to let that group in. When my friend approached him asking why he had done that and asked for the manager or owner they said he wasn't there. My friend said she had just seen the owner a few minutes prior. The attendant then said ""Oh you think just because he's Indian, he's the owner!?"" My friend then proceeded to tell him NO she had known he was the owner because earlier that's what he had told her. The staff here are rude and will be the downfall of this establishment.
1. There should be a sign that states there is an attendant that sets up all the VR games.
2. Signs should be posted on games that aren't working so that people aren't swiping cards and not getting to play said game. (I seem a few kids swipe their cards on a game in the VR section before the ""attendant"" let them know it wasn't working)
3. There should be a waiting list for the laser tag.
4. The staff should be taught about temperature regulations on the freezers and they should be checked daily.
5. Being rude to customers should not be tolerated when it is not called for.

Review: We recently visited Flipzone Trampoline & Fun Park and were thoroughly disappointed with the condition of the facility. We arrived at opening and noticed several spills in the main entryway and throughout the building, which appeared to be left over from the previous day. The overall cleanliness was very poor, making the environment feel unkempt and uninviting. Several of the game machines were out of order, further limiting the activities available.

After visually checking the space, we made the decision to cancel our party reservation due to the lack of upkeep. While the concept of the park is great, the lack of maintenance and attention to cleanliness made it impossible for us to proceed with our plans. We hope improvements are made in the future to better meet guest expectations.

Review: This place always disappoints us! My 4yo son loves the ticket/prize games the most at places like this, but they always only have half of those games actually working that he can play. The worst part is some will be plugged in with no sign that it's broken, and you won't find out until you tap your card and lose your credits. We added a bunch of credits several months ago but couldn't use any due to most not working, but we were told they couldn't refund us because it was run by a different company. We returned again to try to use our credits only to find that many machines still didn't work. Luckily, I was able to make the best out of it for my son so I don't have to come back. I will drive to Jacksonville for Dave & Buster's next time.

Review: Went there yesterday with a friend to play some laser tag thought we would do some VR before we went in the VR machine ate my money thought I only put $20 in there actually put $70 in there with zero credit and no gaming card. I reported the incident to the owner Which he walked over and said you‚Äôre not trying to scam me. Are you thinking I only put $20 in there. I told him I put 5 ones 1 five dollar and the 10 bills in there when actually I put 70 in there. Long story short He argued that I was trying to scam him, and I never put the money in there, which was the total lie. He‚Äôs not an upstanding man. I think I might go in today just to see if he counted the money and pulled the report to see that the money was over and will return me my money but as of now He‚Äôs not a upstanding man in my eyes. Which suck because there actually nothing to do in Brunswick.

Review: Kid has fun. Its a little pricey. There is more than just trampolines, which is kinda nice. But theres multiple locations in jax, too, that are just as diverse but not as picky. Just a simple water bottle will get you griped at. They are very wishy washy on what socks you wear. Some days any real jump socks are fine, some days it has to be a certain kind of socks. How do I know what socks to bring? The sock bit is a big con to get you to pay more. We have literally 15 different pairs of socks now between the 3 or 4 different parks because this particular one is too picky about them. No one we have been to in jax cares what color your socks are as long as they are real jump socks. I think I have griped about it enough now to have a permanent note on my phone and my hubs phone to not come back here and just stick to jax. Personally, theyre all about the same distance time wise, so there's no incentive to come here in particular.

Review: My kids { 3 & 9 months } loved the place I just wish it was cleaner and there was more staff / enforcement of the rules. The pits had a good bit of trash and there was quite a few springs uncovered in the trampoline area. The toddler area was over run with kids well over 5 and it made me very nervous to really let my kids freely play. We made the best of it and will be back but hope for better order in the future! üôÇ

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly.

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

Review: This place is great for dropping off kids when you have to run some errands etc!!! It felt welcoming the moment I walked through the door. I had a sense my daughter would be safe and enjoy playing here while I took care of some things. As a single mother, I get nervous leaving my daughter but I felt extremely comfortable letting my daughter play here for a few hours. The prices were reasonable!!! The staff were helpful and nice!  They have a secure systems for drop off/pickup. I had access to cameras to see her incase I wanted to peek in on her. I definitely will utilize their services again. 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è

Review: I am so grateful that this service exists in Houston County! This is a need in this county and the owners fulfilled this need. This is a must for parents who could use a break from parenting responsibilities for a few hours. Thank you for taking such sweet care of my boy tonight while I was at a work related function. He had such a great time and he‚Äôs already ready to return. We are looking forward to using you again for all our future date nights and/or work events. I could not ask for a better service, especially when not even most daycares in the area provide live access to cameras. That alone shows the integrity that Drop n‚Äô Play provides to parents.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I wish you all the success in this niche of a business!

The price is affordable and if you get the membership it's totally worth it if you go more than once. Great for winter and rainy days.  Staff is friendly and the place is clean.

They‚Äôre only there to do their jobs which is fine for management but they‚Äôre not friendly or engaging at all with the kids other than telling them what they shouldn‚Äôt be doing in the play areas. I visited yesterday and today and the lady at the register seemed like she wasn‚Äôt having a good day. No customer service. Just gave me a pay the fee and go kind of attitude when I walked in. Didn‚Äôt greet me. Just asked ‚Äúhave you been here before? what‚Äôs your phone number?‚Äù Very dry personalities!

Review: My 2 year old had a good time, but we went when it wasn't busy. The older kids don't watch out for younger kids, so you have to be very mindful of that as a parent. When it's busy,  it's SUPER crowded and not much space for the kids as this is a small space. We have been here a few times, and the game room always has several things not working.
We enjoy that there is a little play area for toddlers, away from the big kids, but there aren't any bounce options just for little kids.

Review: I was harassed by the person who told me she was the owner after I left out and returned within a few minutes of leaving the first time. I believe I was racially profiled and saw no other reason for the harassment. The lady told me that it's unusual for a black man to walk in, by himself, since it's a place for kids. I'm a Behavioral aid and was supervising a family visit. Even after I told her that she continued asking erroneous questions trying to intimidate me. It's sad that in this day and age people still act like this.  To add insult to injury I saw several male Caucasians walk in without kids or women and she did not say one word to any of them. I don't plan on returning to this place ever again.

We picked the premium package which includes everything so I did not have to bring or do a thing! They provided food, drinks, cupcakes, ice cream, all the decorations, arcade tickets for each kid, goodie bags, and a party host. Plus we had all day access for the kids to jump and play. It was amazing. And the owners and hosts went out of their way to make sure we were happy. I highly recommend them for your child‚Äôs party!!

Review: This place is AMAZING! I‚Äôve never heard of it before, then I saw a post on Facebook about painting pumpkins and had to check it out.
First, I wanted to say how I LOVE the mothers area. I safe place to fed your baby, with cameras so you can watch your older kids (never seen that before).
The employees were so sweet, definitely the lady that was helping the kids paint the pumpkins, which was a complete blast.
My daughter loved the bounce houses, and the arcade area. Plus the food smelt amazing, sadly we didn‚Äôt have time to check it out. I‚Äôm so glad I found this place and we will definitely be back.

Review: We hosted my daughter's 7th birthday party at Boston Playground. Everything went smoothly. Both party and play room were clean. Kids had lots of fun playing, climbing, and jumping in the playground. The stuff was very kind and professional. Gave us a couple of polite time reminders: ""You have 30 minutes left... 5 minutes left for your party, "" which were very helpful to keep things moving and wrap things up. Overall, it was a great experience for everyone.

Review: I've gone twice within 30 days, first time for the escape room and the second time for archery. The escape room was fun and what you would expect, the archery however wasn't what I thought. It was more like dodge ball with arrows. Great fun and a bit of a work out, I recommend you stretch beforehand.

Review: I recently booked my son‚Äôs 4th birthday party at Boston Playground. I actually reserved the space before seeing it in person, and I‚Äôm glad I did‚Äîbecause if I had seen it beforehand, I might have had second thoughts. That said, I‚Äôm so glad we went through with it!

The play area is big, clean, and full of fun things to do. There‚Äôs plenty of space for the kids to run around without being on top of each other. One of the best parts is that parents can go in and play too, which made it a really fun experience for both kids and adults. Everyone had a great time!

The party room is definitely small‚Äîjust two picnic tables‚Äîso if you‚Äôre hoping for a full sit-down meal, it‚Äôll feel tight. That was our plan, and while it was a bit cramped, everything still worked out in the end.

Seriously, give yourself the extra time to set up, decorate, clean, and take things down. The time flies. Book at least 30 minutes before and after your party. Trust me, you‚Äôll need it.

The price is actually great‚Äî$500 for two hours. That‚Äôs already a better deal than a lot of similar places charging $700 for the same amount of time. So go ahead and add that extra hour or two and still come out ahead, with more time and a better overall experience.

Yes, the staff does give you a polite push to wrap things up when your time is up‚Äîbut it‚Äôs only fair since they need to get ready for the next group. They were all kind, helpful, and professional throughout.

Tip them in cash if you can‚Äîthey work hard and absolutely deserve it.

Highly recommend for a fun, energetic, and kid-friendly celebration.

Review: The location of this Place is a little tricky to find however, the male staff that looks Hispanic descent is very very awful. I recently attended a party and it was roughly 2:30 pm party over at three. He hollered as if it was a nightclub for us all to leave the space immediately should we not have left the space the party host would‚Äôve been charged an extra hour. He removed items from the playground and then made weird comments about him placing items here he didn‚Äôt touch anything.  Once it was 2:45 he then again started to holla to the crowd to get your kids and go and at this point we didn‚Äôt even finish eating cake we left as we passed through the regular crowd that looked at us so puzzled. As walking by a visitor said ‚Äúomg im sorry that you guys are being shouted at ‚Äú I would never attend this place and if you have a big group please don't attend you will be dissatisfied.

Review: I'm giving this place of three stars because its a nice concept and play area. Although when they tell you 2 hours, it's only 2 hours,to set up, play, eat, dessert (cutting cake)and clean up. G (worker) was ok, I know he was just doing his job but his delivery and actions were not very welcoming or positive. (Rushing us and my guests out the door telling us to head to the exit)  He did apologize and informed us it's just his job but my family and guests never want to come back. It's not a party place for an event it's more of an activity to get the kids out the house and burn some steam. I would not order pizza from the place that they suggest because when I mean the Box are small. A large box of pizza that costs $20 for 8 slices was not worth it. Even the pizza were small, domino's pizza is bigger and cheaper.

Review: We had a great party celebrating our daughter's 2nd birthday at Boston Playground! The booking process online was easy and simple. They were open on a Monday holiday. We had a group of 40+. For large groups, I would recommend adding the additional hour so guests can have more time on the playground.

Here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
-The venue was very clean
-The venue accommodated our large group
-Tables, chair/bench and fridge was provided
-They allowed the freedom to decorate freely
- All kids age group 3-10 enjoyed themselves
- It was private to just our group

Cons:
-The venue was very cold, although we asked many times to have the thermostat increased
- the party room was on the smaller side, kids were able to sit at the tables but adults stood and overflowed into the hallway
- There was no host so you have to manage your own time and keep track of your 2 hours
- The pizza shop recommended for catering was not a great experience. Guests mentioned the pizza did not taste good. I would suggest ordering from your preferred pizza shop (we wish we did).

Overall it was a good experience and we would recommend to others looking for an indoor playground for a kid's birthday party.

Review: I had the pleasure of going here for the first time this past Thursday. The pricing isn't too clear on the website. If you have a sibling one of them is free to play? But the sibling has to be a baby. Putting that aside I came on a weekday at the place was well kept. The bouncy is huge, big blocks that are toddler friendly, ping pong and a host of activities for toddlers and big kids. The wooden area where they held the soccer balls is a little dangerous for toddlers who are still trying to find their balance. My daughter bumped her lip on it. It's a little slipper too as you required to only enter with socks. All in all my daughter enjoyed herself and cannot wait to bring her back again.

Review: We had a birthday party today and it was an amazing day. All the children, even the little ones, had a lot of fun. I have only two bad situations to mention. We arrived 15 minutes before our time to organize the room, but it was not available for us. Our reservation was at 2 pm and the room was available at 2:10 pm. It was a little uncomfortable because we have some guests waiting. The second point, the bouncy house was flat when the kids went to the playroom. I was waiting a long time for a team (she was amazing and very helpful), she was helping another group, but she answered me well when I asked for help. Despite wasting some time, we really liked the place and our guests were very happy.

Review: VERY DISAPPOINTED AND NOT RECOMMEND.

Based on what I heard, this suppose to be one of the top indoor playground for families. We booked a private party for total of 18, and hoping to have a good two and half hour there.

However, the time was full of disappointment:

- The place is super hard to find from outside. No clear notice or board showing you how to get inside. You have to go into a dollar tree and find a secret path to the playground.

- Safety concerns all over the place. We have 5 toddlers in our group. But the place is lacking proper protections for all ages: the outlets are all exposed, the foosball table poles were broken...

- Staff run into the playground and start cleaning in the middle while kids are playing. This is very annoying because kids get upset when the their settings get reset.

The duration of this session was also very confusing, they allow you to add party package to get 30 mins more, which we expect to be two and half based on the website. Their staff cannot explain the rate at all so he has to call the ‚Äúboss man‚Äù to clarify it.

Anyhow, it was quite an unpleasant experience for us.

Review: I booked the private play session (1.5hrs) for a 2 and 4 yr old, and both had a blast. The space was the perfect size for them to run free, while still being manageable for the adult(s). There are multiple stations with varying activities that appeal to all ages. Who doesn‚Äôt love an oversized pool (soccer) table?? Everything was very clean, orderly and new. There‚Äôs a snack/break room that you can rent for addl $10. I definitely recommend adding it,  unless you have a unicorn child who doesn‚Äôt demand snacks every hour. There was one staff member who mostly stayed in their office, besides checking in a couple times. But the office is easily accessible should you need anything. It was perfect for the current state of public outings. We had everything we needed and were allowed to use the whole time for ourselves. At the time that we went, we were allowed to be mask-less once inside the kids‚Äô space. This was the real winner as it‚Äôs impossible to get a mask on a toddler...again, unless they‚Äôre a unicorn.

Review: I came to indoor playground the day after thanksgiving around 6:30 with my husband, 7 year old and 2 year old daughters. We came in and were greeted by a nice guy who told us his boss would be right with us. On the website it is clearly stated that 0-2 1st child free and 3-12 is $12. I told the manager that was ringing us up that my daughter was 2 and he proceeded to tell me 2 and up was regular price. I didn‚Äôt want to argue since I was already there with my family. I suggest either updating the website or being more knowledgeable about the prices you list on your website. Upon entering, it is pretty small. We had fun and there were a few things to do with just us since the room was empty and no other families or children were there. On a crowded day it may be an issue as the room is really small. Other than the pricing issue, it‚Äôs a great place to bring the kids to burn off some energy on a slow night where there isn‚Äôt too many people. It‚Äôs new so not too many people know of it for now. I would‚Äôve given 4 stars if it wasn‚Äôt about the pricing.

Review: This place exhibits a grossly negligent and apathetic approach to guest safety (and is unsanitary and not well maintained on top of all that). Despite recurring injuries in specific areas, they make no meaningful effort to implement preventive measures or improve safety protocols.

Instead of addressing the risks, they simply rely on a flimsy liability waiver as a legal shield‚Äîreopening hazardous zones without additional oversight, signage, or support. Their disregard for basic injury prevention reflects a disturbing prioritization of profits over people.

Quick cash grab for the owners.

Review: Most money hungry kids place I've been to. Took my 4yo to jump. They Tried to charge me for a baby under 1 to crawl on the floor in the toddler zone. They tried to charge me 3.09 for a cup of ice water. There is no free water or fountain. Management made up some joke story about not having insurance to cover a fountain and they pipe they're filtered water in.
The place is hot and dirty. I'm sweating on a rainy day, the floors are dirty and there was no soap in the ladies room.
The workers don't seem to care and wouldn't even help my 4yo carry her tube up the slide. They weren't even busy. There was a total of maybe 10 kids on the floor.
It seems like alot of the things are roped off and needing repair.
They are trying to nickle and dime people to death and offer as little as they can. Will not be returning.

Review: I have been here numerous times before and have even invited friends and family but after this experience today we will not be back. Me and my son were harassed from the time we went enter and I left within 20 -30 mins ! An employee picked up my son to look at his socks after I stated his socks have the grips on the bottom! I do not appreciate someone touching my child without my permission. Another employee stated that children have to wear flip zone socks due to their policy so they would not be sued but if I wanted to continue to let him jump then that would be up to me. I stated ‚Äú yes he wants to continue to jump‚Äù . She left and then someone else told me that I would need to purchase the socks and I stated I would like a refund because I just came in within the past month and these are the same socks ! Every time we go we were jumpy socks and I have never had any issues. I was told different information each time and that is unacceptable.It‚Äôs very unfortunate that my son could not enjoy his time and we had to leave early and I was denied my refund !!

Review: Don't get me wrong, it's a nice and fun place, but when entering into the VR section you're being followed by an associate that stands 5 feet behind you. Makes you feel unwelcome. Been watching the area for 30 mins and anyone that enters is followed the same and never plays. I'm sure other patrons feel the same.

Review: Sorry in advance for the long review.
I went to this establishment with some friends yesterday for their sons birthday. While the kids were jumping my friend and myself went to get a snack. She purchased a frozen banana and I was in line to purchase mine when she opened hers and bit into it. My friend immediately had to spit out the piece of banana as it had gone bad and was partially melted. I asked if I could open mine up before purchasing and the girl reluctantly said yes. That one was also partially melted and you could tell it had melted and refroze before that as it looked like when a candy bar melts and you put it in the freezer. I obviously did not purchase the banana, but they offered nothing to my friend who had purchased hers. The staff then started going through the freezer and realized half of the freezer was defrosted and had to throw away all of those items on that side. Now food regulations are not my specialty, but I don't see that the other half of the freezers items could have possibly been at food grade temp. All of the items should have been disposed of in the freezer. After that we purchased cards for the kids to play the arcade/ VR games. When my son got on to one of the VR games he said he couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I thought maybe it hadn't taken the card and swiped it again. It had taken the money off the card, now 2 times. It was at this point a young lady came over (mind you this was like 4 or 5 minutes later) and I was saying that we had swiped it and the money came off twice and we couldn't figure out how to get the machine to work. She then proceeds to explain that is because she has to release it. Apparently she was supposed to be working that section and helping everyone with the VR games. She begins strapping my son in and when she straps his feet in he asks if the ride goes upside down. She replied yes and he said no he didn't want to do that, so she let's him off. No offer to put back on the money or anything. There were multiple people trying to get on the VR rides and no one knew that there was even an attendant for that area. The attendant did have time to constantly be on her phone though. Lastly the group of kids were waiting to go into the laser tag game. They were waiting for the group ahead of them to finish because there were small kids in that group and they were trying to be polite because we had older kids. The attendant told them they could wait for their turn to finish. Our group sat at the tables by the laser tag while the other group played. Another group came up and was standing at the door and once the first group finished the attendant proceeded to let that group in. When my friend approached him asking why he had done that and asked for the manager or owner they said he wasn't there. My friend said she had just seen the owner a few minutes prior. The attendant then said ""Oh you think just because he's Indian, he's the owner!?"" My friend then proceeded to tell him NO she had known he was the owner because earlier that's what he had told her. The staff here are rude and will be the downfall of this establishment.
1. There should be a sign that states there is an attendant that sets up all the VR games.
2. Signs should be posted on games that aren't working so that people aren't swiping cards and not getting to play said game. (I seem a few kids swipe their cards on a game in the VR section before the ""attendant"" let them know it wasn't working)
3. There should be a waiting list for the laser tag.
4. The staff should be taught about temperature regulations on the freezers and they should be checked daily.
5. Being rude to customers should not be tolerated when it is not called for.

Review: We recently visited Flipzone Trampoline & Fun Park and were thoroughly disappointed with the condition of the facility. We arrived at opening and noticed several spills in the main entryway and throughout the building, which appeared to be left over from the previous day. The overall cleanliness was very poor, making the environment feel unkempt and uninviting. Several of the game machines were out of order, further limiting the activities available.

After visually checking the space, we made the decision to cancel our party reservation due to the lack of upkeep. While the concept of the park is great, the lack of maintenance and attention to cleanliness made it impossible for us to proceed with our plans. We hope improvements are made in the future to better meet guest expectations.

Review: This place always disappoints us! My 4yo son loves the ticket/prize games the most at places like this, but they always only have half of those games actually working that he can play. The worst part is some will be plugged in with no sign that it's broken, and you won't find out until you tap your card and lose your credits. We added a bunch of credits several months ago but couldn't use any due to most not working, but we were told they couldn't refund us because it was run by a different company. We returned again to try to use our credits only to find that many machines still didn't work. Luckily, I was able to make the best out of it for my son so I don't have to come back. I will drive to Jacksonville for Dave & Buster's next time.

Review: Went there yesterday with a friend to play some laser tag thought we would do some VR before we went in the VR machine ate my money thought I only put $20 in there actually put $70 in there with zero credit and no gaming card. I reported the incident to the owner Which he walked over and said you‚Äôre not trying to scam me. Are you thinking I only put $20 in there. I told him I put 5 ones 1 five dollar and the 10 bills in there when actually I put 70 in there. Long story short He argued that I was trying to scam him, and I never put the money in there, which was the total lie. He‚Äôs not an upstanding man. I think I might go in today just to see if he counted the money and pulled the report to see that the money was over and will return me my money but as of now He‚Äôs not a upstanding man in my eyes. Which suck because there actually nothing to do in Brunswick.

Review: Kid has fun. Its a little pricey. There is more than just trampolines, which is kinda nice. But theres multiple locations in jax, too, that are just as diverse but not as picky. Just a simple water bottle will get you griped at. They are very wishy washy on what socks you wear. Some days any real jump socks are fine, some days it has to be a certain kind of socks. How do I know what socks to bring? The sock bit is a big con to get you to pay more. We have literally 15 different pairs of socks now between the 3 or 4 different parks because this particular one is too picky about them. No one we have been to in jax cares what color your socks are as long as they are real jump socks. I think I have griped about it enough now to have a permanent note on my phone and my hubs phone to not come back here and just stick to jax. Personally, theyre all about the same distance time wise, so there's no incentive to come here in particular.

Review: Adventure Town comes highly recommended from my family and me! They have numerous stations for kids, they even have a gated area exclusively for babies 0-12m which for me is very thoughtful of them, and the staff ensures each one is clean and organized. Also, a big thank you to the staff who helped my husband locate his misplaced phone. It wasn't their responsibility to help, but they went above and beyond, searching every station. Fortunately, he found it, and the staff even called to ensure he had it back. Thank you, Adventure Town staff!

Review: Cute concept. Wanted to love it. My kid had fun and the staff was super nice. But oh my goodness the place is so dirty. Needs maintenance desperately.

Flooring coming up, toys broken and still in circulation, grim everywhere. Also, I read they clean the ball put every two months. They need to up that cleaning rotation...badly.

I want to try this place again. Like I said, I love the idea and my kid had a blast...but I cannot in good faith keep taking him back if I'm not 100% sure it's cleaned and maintained.

Will change this review in the future if we go back and I see improvements.

Review: It‚Äôs absolutely amazing! Well worth the $20 price for each child. You do have to wear socks only you can bring your own or you can purchase a pair for $3 each. It‚Äôs a little town for children and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing. I had so much fun playing with my niece.

Review: We took our Pre-K class from Windsor Academy to Giggle Town for our Last Day celebration. The children, the parents and the teachers had a fantastic time. The place was very clean and well organized. The children played for a solid 3 1/2 hours and never complained about being bored or ready to leave. They enjoyed the ball pit, each one of the play stations in busy town, the slide in the soft play area and the interactive game tables. The teachers enjoyed exploring and spending time with the children and the parents enjoyed getting to be kids again! I would recommend Giggle Town to anyone with children ages 2 to about 6. I would also recommend it to classrooms who are looking for a fantastic field trip opportunity. We are already looking at our calendar to book another visit for next school year.

They close at 8 on sundays , & we arrived at 7, so the owner gave us a one time discount that was very much appreciated ! Everything was beautiful and clean ( including the bathrooms !!) They have a ball pit with a slide, a little carousel for the babies, & multiple play stations for the kids ( grocery store, bakery, construction zone, etc )  We will definitely be returning .100/10 üíØüíØü´∂üèæ

Each area had many different toys to play with and enough to accommodate multiple kids at a time. I would definitely recommend getting there early with younger kids.

Review: Love this place! My kids enjoy it so much. We try to go in the mornings, before the 6+ crowd comes in. So many places to explore and really use their imagination!
That said, my kids have had strep throat after each time we go. We are talking six times in the last year. We tried not going for a couple of months and nothing. First day back in and now the house has strep throat. It‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs a great place to go and let them burn off some energy! Also think there should be an age cut off because some of the older kids are just rough.

Review: We have been coming here since opening and we have truly loved making this part of our one year old week. Today (sunday) we went by at 3 pm when it should be open to public but unfortunately was turned away due to an ongoing private party and was told that they do not know when they will be open to public today as current party keeps booking the additional hours. From their website, it shows private hours are from certain times. I understand private party was providing them the best financial outcome but it would also be great if you followed your own guidelines that the business set or just close for the whole day committed to private parties.

Review: I actually love this place for my one year old. I allowed an employee to talk me into the membership for a month for my older children because of course $50 for one visit is better than $25 each visit. They enjoyed their time there but was only able to visit twice. The following month (this month) I seen the charge again on my 5 year old card. I immediately canceled and asked for a refund and was asked a thousand questions. School is back in session and this place is more for babies than 5+. We would not be able to utilize the membership so it would be a waste of money is what I explained but they stopped responding. All of the money I‚Äôm sure they make, issuing a refund should not be an issue! It‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs the principle that I explained this is a five year old allowance and they did not care. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend a membership for any child over 3 or 4. I‚Äôll no longer support this business or any of their businesses.

Update : they responded shortly after I posted this stating that they released the refund but did not.

Review: This is genuinely one of the best kid centric places I‚Äôve ever been! My almost four year old and 1.5 year old had an absolute blast.

Everything is extremely well laid out and open plan so you can see your kids from almost anywhere in the building, which is great if you have multiple little ones running in different directions. The stations are all amazing and perfect for my kids ages. There is guaranteed to be something that will appeal to almost any kid under the age of 7 or 8. This place engages the imagination and fine and gross motor skills! I was honestly really impressed with how much they could fit in the space.

There was someone out on the floor cleaning almost constantly, and absolutely nothing in the building looked messy or dirty. Even the bathrooms were impeccably clean.

Can‚Äôt recommend this place highly enough! My kids are going to be begging to come back the next time we‚Äôre in town.

The venue was so cute, nicely and appropriately decorated and the play space was just enough for a one year old and friends to enjoy. Things were neat and clean as well.  The two owners I met were sweet,  knowledgeable and very helpful! We certainly plan to return!

Review: I reached out to the CVLRC about holding a DIY Valentine class, so that my kids could create more eco-friendly valentines for their classmates. Olivia loved the suggestion and put together a great class that taught me and my kids new skills and left us with these adorable valentines. The space is beautiful and promotes creative play, while being cozy for the adults. My kids never want to leave.

Review: I was in search of somewhere to go with my 2 toddlers (2 and 3) that was CLEAN and SAFE. Here‚Äôs why I give Little Lions Den 5 Stars!
*CLEAN: the owner also uses non-toxic cleaning supplies
*SAFE: everything is age appropriate and good for ages 0-5. This means that I don‚Äôt have to worry (too much) about big kids crushing mine. The owner makes sure all kids are being safe while playing too!
*GREAT SIZE: large enough for there to be lots of things for my kids to do and never get bored. It‚Äôs also small enough that I can see them everywhere no matter where I‚Äôm at.
*LOCAL/FAMILY OWNED: the owner is SO SWEET! She‚Äôs a former educator, so she is intentional about her space being fun AND educational. Her kids are fantastic and so sweet to my kids.
*AFFORDABLE: $10 per kid and monthly memberships available too!
*BIRTHDAY PARTIES: get the whole space, able to decorate, and bring your own food! Ridiculously affordable as well!
*EVENTS: they‚Äôve had several events like reading with Elsa and movement classes. We are excited about the Valentine‚Äôs Day brunch.
*COFFEE: I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs adding coffee YALL WE NEED IT!

Review: I have taken my daughter here with friends many times. It‚Äôs always a good time for the kids! It‚Äôs essentially a giant play room with every possible toy for pretend play, building legos, dress up, and indoor physical activity a kid could imagine. It‚Äôs an open room with very few hidden areas. So parents can relax while being able to keep an eye on their child(ren). There‚Äôs an arts and crafts room that has a different craft in it every visit we‚Äôve been. REMINDER: TO ENTER THE PLAY AREA YOU MUST TAKE OFF SHOES AND WEAR SOCKS. I forgot one time and while they do have socks to purchase, everyone likes to save a couple bucks.

Review: Hosted my daughter's 5th birthday at Sprouts and it was AMAZING! Exceeded my expectations! Previous birthday's were all hosted at home; therefore, I had many questions ü§£ The owner responded promptly
to all my questions and provided me realistic expectations. We arrived on time to decorate and the facility was clean, organized and ready to go! All guests, kiddos and adults, enjoyed their time together. Very thankful to Spouts for a successful 5th birthday for my Little One.

Review: Sprouts Play & Learn is hands down the best indoor playground! My son just celebrated 4th birthday there and we could not ask for better party. Marjorie went beyond and above to make sure everything was exactly like I wanted it. She responded to all my emails and calls promptly with so much kindness and professional. Every single detail that she did, from ballon garland to table set up, was incredible!
The facility itself was immaculately clean.
My son and all his friends had the best time playing &  celebrating. All our guests were so impressed with Marjorie and Sprouts Play & Learn.
Marjorie your kindness and dedication are so appreciated. We are beyond grateful!

Review: My son LOVED Sprouts! We spent our full 2 hour session laughing and playing and we plan to go back in the next week. My son is 2 and Sprouts is perfect for the younger kiddos who can‚Äôt always enjoy typical playground equipment because they are too young. My son‚Äôs favorites were the ball pit and the slide. As a teacher, I also loved seeing all of the learning opportunities in the little town they have at Sprouts. They was a grocery store for shopping, a farmhouse, and a vet!
Everything was safe, clean, and super cute. There is also a separate area for crawlers and little ones who aren‚Äôt quite big enough for the larger play area. My son was exhausted after our playtime and took a nice long nap!
I also found the Sprouts website to be user friendly and I like their reservation system. Each session is 2 hrs with an hour in between so the business can clean up and get ready for the next play group. The women who checked us in was very friendly and helpful and even remembered my son from a birthday party he attended there over a month ago!
I will be recommending Sprouts to all my friends with little ones!!

Review: A very neat concept and the facility looked well taken care of. However I‚Äôve spent years in customer service and I know when someone has made a mistake. We wanted to bring my son up for some play time on his first birthday and being a first time customer we called ahead to ask what we would need before we brought him up. We were told he just needed to have socks in order for him to play. We show up thirty minutes later and the lady at the front desk informed us that the session was about to end which we weren‚Äôt told about over the phone (I understand mistakes happen). When questioned The women we spoke with could not have been more condescending and unsympathetic toward my wife and made no effort to correct the error. My wife enjoys these type of places but unfortunately we will have to cross this place off the list.

Review: This place is well deserving of a lengthy, 5-star review. We are frequent goers to Sprouts, and we have had nothing but positive experiences. My 2 and 3 year old are BIG fans. They have slides, themed playhouses, a HUGE Leggo table, a safe crawling infant area, a craft room and so much more. You‚Äôre kids can play dress up, do puzzles, play with cars, or climb up and slide down. The space is always super clean, and the size is not overwhelmingly large. This makes it easy to keep an eye on your little ones without having to chase behind them the entire time. We love this place so much, we just hosted my son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there. Marjorie was a pleasure to work with and such a big help making the special day flow perfectly. We LOVE Sprouts!! üòç‚ù§Ô∏è

Review: Sprouts play and learn set the bar for the indoor playground scene! No detail was missed; from the handcrafted structures to the toys to the utilization of the space. Sprouts is inventive, creative, joyful, and of course, fun! It is evident that an experienced parent and teacher put her heart into developing Sprouts. Sprouts allowed space for our two year old daughter to be physically challenged and excited to explore safely and it provided multiple modes and opportunities for pretend play. The excitement on our daughters face upon arrival was comparable to her face at Disney World. We loved every minute of our time at Sprouts and look forward to getting more opportunities to play!

Review: My 1 year old had fun. The owner was very sweet and accommodating. The place was clean and it wasn't busy or overcrowded at all. I will say that the current location is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, as I think most of the photos from other reviews must be from a previous location. They aren't usually open for play on Saturdays unless they don't have a party scheduled so I was worried it would be packed but was glad to be wrong. Cute place for your tot to get out of the sun and play something new.

The owner was super helpful with our vendor before the start of the party. The kids had a great time, it‚Äôs the perfect place for a play date during the week with the little ones.

They blew bubbles and played music. The kids really enjoyed. They provide plates, napkins, and utensils. They have a lot of toys for toddlers to play with and play on. Overall it was perfect. I do wish the party hours were a tad longer only because 2 hours go by really fast. Although  older kids may be entertained, I think the perfect age for for this place is 1-3, maybe 4. Also, it is a little difficult to find. Just look for Jimmy Johns on the right when heading towards TJMaxx. Thanks Tiny Feet for a great experience and we will be back!

Not to worry though because no big kids were there anyway! It cleared out when the parties went back to the room though and we had the whole place to ourselves. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again!

Review: Unfortunately the staff member that was in charge ruined our experience by constantly getting on to the kids for being kids. We had a play date there and to 2yr olds and 4yr olds they were using the terms ‚Äútimeout‚Äù ‚Äúyour going to be in trouble‚Äù although I use these terms myself I am the parent and not a stranger and a stranger should never say that to a child that isn‚Äôt theirs. Us parents were talking care of the ‚Äúissues‚Äù each time. Also they need to have better barriers to keep kids from getting behind the inflatables. It was a very disappointing experience and truthfully never wants to go back again. My kids even said it wasn‚Äôt fun thanks to the staff member and they are 2 and 4 making this statement. That says something.

Heads up it‚Äôs only for littles, I think under 10 or 12.

Tons of outlets to charge devices along with a large bar to eat or drink. You can tell plenty of thought has gone into making everything as kid friendly as possible.

Nice change from the massive trampoline parks charging an arm and a leg for 90 minutes. Will make this a stop on future trips!

Under the age of two is free and older kids are only 10 dollars. No idea how they can only charge 10 dollar but it‚Äôs the best 10 bucks you can spend. Very friendly staff is hard to find these days but they are super friendly here. Looks like they have some super cool birthday party options where you can rent the whole place out. You just can‚Äôt wrong taking the the kiddos here.

(4&6) All the kids had a blast and surprisingly there are quite a few inflatables for the space, but the set up felt a little sketch, it would be nice to have a better way to see what the kids are doing in some areas if you don't want to (or can't) get up in and on the inflatable. Party room was very small. Just wish we had scoped the place out first.
Edit: management responded quickly and I remembered she was very helpful with my wife when she called and made reservations.

Review: My almost three year old enjoyed the experience playing indoors with the large variety toys and other materials. I did not enjoy paying an extra $20 to carry my 7 month old majority of the time and then let her sit on the floor and mouth one toy. Thankfully, I was with friends so someone could keep an eye on my baby who cannot crawl so I could chase my older child. I would not recommend for infants over 7 months. When I was booking the play session, there was nothing asking for children‚Äôs ages. It is stated somewhere else on their website where 7 months and older are required to pay if I had seen that I would have asked friends to meet somewhere else.

We booked a party here for our little one and then had a family emergency a few days before. When I contacted them to reschedule, they were extremely understanding and accommodating. Nilsa especially went completely ABOVE + BEYOND and set up the absolute most adorable party for us! She stated that if we dropped off the decorations, she would gladly set them up for us and not only did she do that but made the entire experience completely wonderful and oh so sweet. She assisted with additional set-up, the clean up and was there the whole time to make sure the party ran smoothly and perfectly. As a parent of two under two, this an absolute dream party experience: easy, adorable and fun!! The kids had a blast and we as the parents got to enjoy the day with our birthday girl because everything was taken care of!  I cannot recommend this place enough!!

She also informed also about an in house speech pathologist they have which I thought was very cool ! My daughter‚Äôs currently in speech therapy but since we‚Äôre away from home that‚Äôs currently on pause. The playroom was a nice open and clean space for children to play in ! I was very pleased with the selection of toys they had and the fact everything was very low stimulating. It was wildly crazy or blasting Christian family music or baby lullaby music which nothing is bad about either it‚Äôs just a bit redundant to hear either or every time you go to a place like this. They played nice soft classic Disney music which I loved and it just wasn‚Äôt overstimulating for me. My daughter enjoyed her time with the ball pit slide and the corner room that had a bin of little fidgets for her to play with the room was very neat, organized and cozy. The bathrooms were very clean as well. Additionally any other staff we passed by all looked pleasantly happy to be there and happy to assist if needed! It‚Äôs a bit of a drive for us to come since we‚Äôre in the middleburg area but the atmosphere made it worth wild so we‚Äôll be planning to come back soon!

Review: We are new members but each time we have played I am more impressed than the previous time. The most important thing for a play space for my piece of mind is cleanliness, & this place is spotless. My kids like having multiple rooms to be able to play in. There‚Äôs two play rooms, a little hallway area & then also the snack spots. When I initially walked into the main area I thought it was a little small & needs some natural light, but it‚Äôs honestly perfect. My almost 6 yo daughter, 3.5 yo son & 15 month old all find things to play with. They have really adorable & uplifting art all over. The slide & ball pit climbing area are great. Dress up, some Montessori style flowers, bugs, trains, push toys, blocks, kitchen with tables. It really has it all. This will definitely be our spot a few times a week this summer. Very pleased with the price being $100 a month for all 3 of my kids too. The family that owns it is so kind. Each one of them has been so sweet to my kids even if they are having a crazy moment. Highly, highly recommend! :)

Everything was clean, the toys were great quality and great developmentally for my little guy. I was surprised how much he loved it and we even saw a 3 and 6 year old there having just as much fun. Most definitely great for all ages. We look forward to coming back and possibly getting a membership and taking advantage of all the activities they have planned each day.

Review: The Playful Family has been a God send for our family! We are always greeted with a smile from the staff and owners when we walk in the door. It‚Äôs always clean and there‚Äôs lots of fun stuff for the littles to enjoy. From the play and sensory areas to arts and crafts, music, & special events ect. There‚Äôs always something fun going on. Ms. Loraine (sp?) is so friendly and creative and so good with the kids. We play there about 3 times a week and always have a great experience. I highly recommend the monthly membership that they offer!

I would also like to take an extra minute to share our latest experience with anyone that may need more convincing to join The Playful Family or anyone that may just enjoy a little inspirational story. One that has made us forever customers.

I have 3 sons. An 11 month old and 3 year old Twins, one of whom has Autism. He typically does great when we come play. We attended this Saturday and it was a bit busier than it typically is during the week. Even with his noise canceling headphones, he became a bit overwhelmed and had some pretty big meltdowns. Mainly due to things not being in their ‚Äúcorrect spot‚Äù while other kids were playing with them. I decided that we should probably head home and try again another day. That is when his largest meltdown of the day began. I became extremely overwhelmed trying to pack up 3 little ones that are never ready to leave The Playful family. While one twin was on the floor screaming, kicking and crying, my other twin was begging to do a craft before leaving. They were building and painting birdhouses for Fathers Day. My hands were so full between juggling the baby and trying to calm a worked up 3 year old. I apologized to my other 3 year old and explained that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to do the craft that day. That is when Ms. Franchescka (whom also happens to be the CEO, I believe) stepped in and offered to build and paint a birdhouse with Grayson. She was so kind and genuine. He was so happy and so proud of his completed birdhouse made with his new friend. It was time to leave and the meltdown was still going on. As I struggled my way towards the door with 3 kids. Ms. Franchescka and Ms. Nilsa both jumped up and offered to help us to the car with zero hesitation. One carrying the baby and one carrying a freshly painted birdhouse. Reassuring me over and over that I was doing a good job and that everything was ok. I was also reassured that there was no reason to apologize. While I apologized for the chaos more times than I can probably count.
I will never forget the kindness that was extended to myself and my children. It‚Äôs so refreshing to know that there are still kind and caring people in the world. Willing and ready to lend encouraging words and a helping hand in any way they can. We are blessed to have found that and more at The Playful Family! :)

We are sad they eliminated the play passes as they were amazing for our family, to bring one kid or the other or both, they are better for our family and we had no commitment of a monthly fee. We haven‚Äôt visited again since then. :( Wished they reconsider bringing those back.

Of course, being younger there was a limited amount of activities he wasn‚Äôt scared of doing/could do, but he had a wonderful time nonetheless! It was also the perfect day to be able to go to an indoor playground since the weather was being funky.

Also want to add, there seemed to be an issue with one family there, but the two ladies who took care of the situation did so with grace and a lot of patience rather than the alternative. I‚Äôm not sure of the situation, but I know being in any kind of issue with a customer can be very stressful.

Review: I don‚Äôt like leaving bad reviews but I feel like it‚Äôs necessary. As they are asking for reviews and get a tube of chapstick.
It‚Äôs an extremely bad area, drug deals going on outside, the play equipment is broken, doesn‚Äôt work, or missing parts, not to mention the horrible bathrooms. There are signs hanging up saying excuse the smell they‚Äôre working on it but you can tell they‚Äôve been up awhile. This is a sad representation for the business as it‚Äôs not kept up or cleaned even with the franchise owner there.

Edit to respond to owner:
The place speaks for itself and we visited there over a month ago so I hope the ‚Äúpipe issues‚Äù has been resolved by now because the build up of methane in closed areas is dangerous along with the broken down equipment that‚Äôs to much to list.

Review: We had my baby's first birthday party at Playpalz.  This was the first time I have ever spent money on a ""venue"" for a party.  Will I do it again?  maybe, all places for kids parties are about the same in price. Value for the price is so so.  I spent close to 500 for Party Room B.  The room was a nice size to fit all my guests and super clean and ready for me to decorate.  The party came with 15 drinks for kids and 2 pizzas.  Great if you are just planning on feeding kids.  If you are wanting to feed the grownups too then you will need to purchase more pizza and drink packages... I understand the reasoning for no outside food or drinks but I also find it silly that I have to spend 40 dollars for 40 waters that I could easily buy at walmart for maybe way less.  It was a Saturday so that place was insanely crazy as you can imagine but all the kids had a great time.  You are only allotted 90 minutes for party set up/ take down and party time.  I feel like it was a little rushed, decorations were taken down I feel like almost right after putting them up.  I think people should get a full 2 hours.  I brought my own decor but made sure it was all put together at home so that when I brought it in all we had to do was tape to the wall.  Brings me to my next point.  We were not allowed to thumb tac anything and could only use tape they provided (which was NOT good tape).  My decorations kept falling, which was very frustrating.  I was given a party host Chelsea.  Chelsea was phenomenal!  She helped we bring decor to the room, helped me put decor up, helped decorate the highchair, kept the party moving smoothly, handed out pizza, helped with cake, helped clean up after my baby after his smash cake.  She was my right hand man and I couldn't have done the party without her.  Thank you Chelsea, well deserved included gratuity.   I love playpalz and will always return for a fun play day but as for a party place I feel like there are cheaper options out there that allow you to bring your own outside food and drink for a longer party time.

Then after party deposit and party itself paid for another surprise fee of gratuity and end of booking fee we went charged. WOULDN'T recommend to nobody it was a rip off.

Review: To start, My child loved getting to play on the equipment they have and with their friends. They didn't want to leave at all, which is why I'm leaving 2 stars. I took off 3 stars because I did not see the value for the amount of money spent and I will explain why.
First reason: they only include 20 slices of pizza and 15 drinks [what the girl on the phone to confirm my party add ons said, even though their website states 20 drinks are included] for up to 25 guests and those 25 guests, include adults. You may not bring any outside food or drink, which is fine, but the amount charged for the food they provide is high. I added on a fruit tray [that was $60] because I wanted the fruit available for the kids and from my child's party last year, that was about what I spent on fruit for my own fruit trays and I wouldn't have to wash and cut it... the fruit tray that was brought into the party room was in a store bought container and was less fruit than what I spent $60 on last year, plus the very large strawberries were whole. For a place that has all ages of children, I find it incredibly odd that they did not at least half, if not quarter the strawberries. The high food add ons, that you're pretty much forced into, also contribute into my ire on my third reason.
Second reason: I paid for a theme add on and for that $30, I got a themed happy birthday sign, a stack of themed plates, a stack of themed napkins, & about 5 themed tablecloths. I did not get to keep any of those supplies and you could clearly see labelled boxes under the tables for other themes. It was also clearly outlined, that plates, napkins, tablecloths, & utensils were already included in the base party price.... I'm super confused on why the add on stated ""come in to your party already decorated,"" when it was a sign and tablecloths and why the add on is $30.
Third reason: we had a party host included in the base price that was for ""party set up, clean up, & to coordinate,"" that gets an automatic 5% gratuity added on to your final bill. I'm totally fine with the concept, but the execution was lacking. The host did the set up and clean up, but the only thing she did for ""coordinating,"" was ask when she should have the pizza in the room. For a tipped position with coordinating the party as part of the position, I expected the host to actually have a timeline and help us stick to the timeline within the 90min we had the room for. She was nowhere to be seen part of the time and the other part of the time she was just in a corner of the room watching people. Actually making sure your parties are happening on schedule is important... We were supposed to have 10min before the party in our party room. We arrived exactly 10min before, to find the party room was not actually ready and it was past our party start time before we got to go back to it. I highly suggest coaching your host staff on giving parties a heads up when there's 30min & 10min left and leaving more time in between parties to accomodate for any running a little over, clean up, and so incoming parties actually get their 10min before their guests start arriving to get settled in.
Fourth reason: Overall customer service... I ran out of room to fully elaborate, but there were multiple times I was asked about adding their add ons and multiple times I had questions that were not answered. There was no guidance on where to finish paying for the party and despite asking for a receipt as I checked out, I still had to go back for it. The woman that did complete my transaction, did ask how the party was and did ask for feedback on what could be better; I was just too overwhelmed and tired in the moment to answer her then.
Fifth reason: the bathrooms are in the no shoes area and my partner immediately left the mens room and went somewhere else to use the bathroom.
Sixth reason: Included in the base price is a t-shirt and FREE return pass for the birthday child... We did not receive a t-shirt or any kind of voucher nor did we receive information on how we can redeem the return pass.
Please train your staff better.

Review: Whole place smells like sewer gas. I‚Äôm assuming sewer gas because it was strongest near the bathroom. But it permeated the whole place. My clothes, including my jacket that was kept very far away from bathroom, actually still smelled like it even after I left. Bathrooms had filthy floors and trash can was overflowing. The nursing room is dingy and super depressing. The bins for shoes were beyond dirty and gross. The play space was decent but could use a good deep cleaning. Pros were it was an ok price for an indoor playground and the snacks were cheap. But I couldn‚Äôt get over the smell.

Review: My kids enjoyed their time there so much. We went for 2 1/2 hours and my son couldn‚Äôt even eat his dinner he was so exhausted. This location looked clean and looks taken care of. We will be back or maybe try the Cleveland location next time to see how it is.

I did only give 4 stars because when we were checking in a woman was helping us and she was nice but her mother was also at the front desk and she was very rude to her in the way she spoke . I just didn‚Äôt feel like in front of customers was appropriate. Mom didn‚Äôt really react to it like she was surprised (because when she said it she looked up and So oh that‚Äôs just my mom)  And that may just be their relationship. But it made me feel some type of way standing on the other side of the counter.

Review: There is nothing to keep children from running out of the automatic front doors into the parking lot, including the front desk staff who just watched it happen.  Needs a locked gate.
The price was higher than the price posted.  They bribe with free chapstick for good reviews so you can‚Äôt trust the rating.
It was a Wednesday which is supposed to be sensory/autistic friendly but this is not a safe place for autistic children who elope.
Lastly, a water fountain would be an appropriate addition.
Stars removed for staff attitude when I suggested a lock on the swinging gate.

Review: Overall a great facility however they recently added a few new elements portraying scenes that are too mature for all children. Namely a police and fire fighter scene where people with terrified expressions are being burned out of their homes. The police station has a holding cell for someone serving a life sentence, presumably a rapist or murderer. A cop pointing a gun at a menacing perp handcuffed in a police car‚Ä¶ I wish more thought was given into the decision to add these to the assortment of great play activities. I would love to see these removed.

Edit: it'd be nice to use the massage chairs once in a while but a bunch of ghetto trash just sits in the chairs without paying to use them and just keeps them occupied the entire time

Get there and find the out. That was fine till i found out they turned away my disabled mother. Which should have been okay. My fruit tray i paid for had mold in the black berries.. to end up paying 530 for the rest of the party. I only seen my party host when she took us to the room. Never again seen her. She stay up front with her co worker or was carrying around a small baby. As far as the party. Its was a nice place for kids to play, they had a good time. I would not  have another party here. Way too over priced for what i got.

Review: We recently had our daughter‚Äôs birthday party here. The facility is a fun, colorful and exciting place for kids to play. Our daughter and her friends had a great time! Prior to booking we were told that we would have a party host. Our host was very inattentive. She was in the room when we came in. She left out while we were in the process of handling our signs and putting treat bags out. She spent the remainder of our party time in the front desk area socializing with co workers.  My adult guess, my husband and I all had to ‚Äúwork.‚Äù I had to leave the party room to multiples to ask for things such as our drinks. We never mind to pay for and tip good service. I hope that you all will make improvements. I currently feel that we received false advertisement. Stop telling potential customers that parents can come in and relax as a selling pitch if that is not going to be a reality. Lastly, the mandatory tip that is added to the bill should be optional especially in situations like this. This is a great facility for kids unfortunately the customer service does need to be made a priority.

We usually love this place but this last trip is showing a decrease in quality.
Broken swing, expired food being sold, the ball shooting things being powered off. Stale cookies just sitting in cups they are selling.
It‚Äôs still not bad for the price but it needs maintenance and upkeep.

It used to be 5 stars- and they have promotions for if you give 5 stars you get chapstick, so that skews the rating.
Now it‚Äôs 3 because it‚Äôs still mostly safe and reasonably priced.

Review: I heard about this place a few months ago and finally took my kids here for the first time. The play area was very clean and it appeared very safe. The staff are very attentive to the children and I felt very assured that my kids were going to be well supervised while I was away to run errands. My kids had a blast and we'll definitely come back again!

Review: We absolutely LOVE Drop ‚ÄòN Play! I have a 1 year old son and I was looking for a fun, clean, indoor place I could play with him and it has been the best find! We usually go in the mornings and have it to ourselves or in the afternoon and he can play with other kiddos. Sumayia, the owner is so nice and amazing with kids, we love all of the staff! He has really improved in his climbing and walking skills and gets so excited every time we come!

I dropped them off for a couple hours while I went in for a workout in the saunas at HOTWORX next door. Both children, ages 5 and 7, found things they enjoyed. While one focused on dress up, the other climbed around and played in the ball pit. The youngest raved about Ms. Sierra who oversaw their experience. Thank you!

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

They are so kind and excited to see everyone who comes in. The setup is great for littles AND parents because it‚Äôs easier to spot your little one so I was able to sit back and watch with my newborn while my toddlers ran around. They also have coffee and allow you to bring in your own drinks and snacks. We decided to do the monthly membership because their prices are super affordable and the kiddos had so much fun‚Ä¶ also it‚Äôs a great way to stay out of the summer heat and let your littles get some energy out!

They have a cafe area with complimentary coffee and it's very open so parents can hang out while their kids play. They also provide seating in almost every play area. We were very surprised that it wasn't crazy busy on a Saturday, but I'm assuming not enough people know about it yet. Every single staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and ask if we needed anything/had any questions. This place exceeding our expectations and we will definitely be going back!!

Review: Pretty cute play place! The worker was super energetic and professional. They have a coffee and tea bar for adults, but you have to go up front and ask for the bag inserts. It‚Äôs not so big to where you lose your child in a hoard of other kids. I like the fact that it‚Äôs all day play. You can pay once, play,  and leave if you need to grab lunch or something, then you can come back and play more. The only negative is that I wish I could‚Äôve purchased water instead of having my child drink from the fountain.

I love that this is a local family owned business and that we are supporting them and also supporting a fellow veteran family. They are nothing but friendly, all smiles, welcoming, and hard working. They stayed active the whole time we were there, cleaning, asking if we needed anything, offering to make coffee, etc. I feel they are priced fairly and have a variety of activities to keep the kiddos entertained and also plenty of places for parents to sit. They  have planned it out so thoughtfully having things like tables and chairs, highchairs, changing rooms (with extra diapers and wipes), nursing areas, multiple bathrooms, AND it's all very well kept and clean which is a big deal to me! Hixson has needed something like this for a long time and I am praying and rooting for their business to be so successful!!!

Review: I truly can‚Äôt recommend this place enough! üíØ‚ú® Jumpin' Jellybeans Chattanooga
Not only did the kids absolutely love it, but I have to give a huge shoutout to the amazing staff. They were so friendly and genuinely engaging with the kids‚Äîeven jumping into a few games with them, which made it even more fun! ü•∞
They checked in on us several times and were constantly cleaning‚Äîvacuuming, mopping, wiping things down. The entire place was spotless, which made it feel extra welcoming and safe. üßºüëè
There are several fun areas for kids to explore. My 7-year-old especially loved the air hockey and foosball tables, while my 5-year-old was all about the playhouse with the kitchen and toys üç≥üè†
And for us parents? Tons of comfy seating and a cozy little coffee/tea bar‚Äîsuch a thoughtful touch. ‚òïüíï
But what really stood out was the outstanding service. It‚Äôs rare to find a place where the owner personally offers to make you coffee and checks in to make sure you're comfortable. That kind of personal touch goes a long way ‚ù§Ô∏è
My kids have asked to go back every single day since our visit‚Ä¶ so yes, it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôve found a new favorite spot üòÑ
If you get the chance, seriously‚Äîgo check them out!

Review: Jumpin‚Äô Jellybeans is hands-down the best indoor play gym we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment you walk in, you can feel how much love and care has gone into creating this space. It‚Äôs run by the kindest family, and you truly feel welcomed every time.

We absolutely love that the open play hours includes being able to come and go during the rest of the day. And the fact that we can bring our own food in? Total game changer for families with little ones! Also, they have free coffee and tea for adults.

I‚Äôve been to just about every play gym around, and this is by far the cleanest one. I‚Äôve been four times now, and each visit leaves me even more impressed. My kids (ages 3 and 20 months) have the time of their lives every single time ‚Äî it‚Äôs the kind of place they never want to leave.

If you‚Äôre looking for a safe, clean, joy-filled space for your kids to play their hearts out, Jumpin‚Äô Jellybeans is it. I truly cannot recommend it enough!

Review: I cannot say enough good things about Jumpin' Jellybeans! From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted like old friends by Mr. Bean. His enthusiasm is contagious. He is very kind and attentive to any needs. My kids can play there for hours and still not want to leave. They keep the place meticulously clean. There's a great snack area (a necessity for my snacky kids) that allows outside food and drink. There's also free coffee/ tea for the moms and dads! And while I did not have to use the nursing rooms available, it is so nice to see them there. The environment in these rooms is calm and serene, complete with encouraging quotes and artwork. There's also several toys near these rooms to keep the older ones occupied while you nurse.
We will come back time and time again

Review: We were so impressed by this indoor play place! My 3 year old and I spent all day here with just a quick break for lunch and the entire time we were gone she was talking about wanting to go back. We loved that once you pay your admission you can come and go all day- your kid can even leave and come back later in the day with a different adult if they have a babysitter, parent, or grandparent bring them back. And their hours are so much better than other local play places- they are open late into the evening!  The staff was so friendly and interactive with both the adults and kids. The place was so clean and well run. They were constantly cleaning floors, bathrooms, play structures, toys, everything so you actually know it is clean! The variety of toys and activities is great for all ages. It's great for both cautious and adventurous kids. I also loved as a parent that they were super diligent about making sure kids went home with the correct adult they came with. Most play places don't even watch the door but this place had a gate and safety measures in place. We will definitely be going back and getting a membership in the future!

You literally feel like you‚Äôve known them your whole life everytime you come in. The place is EXTREMELY clean & well kept! Even while you are there you see them  going around cleaning! He is always rounding on everyone making sure everyone is okay and doesn‚Äôt need anything. It is just such an amazing place to take your kids. You also get access all day & jelly beans when you leave which makes getting my toddler out the door so much easier because he never wants to leave. Oh & they have a safe place behind the counter for a bin with all your personal belongings and a number they write on you and yours kids, you all get checked before you leave! They also provide non slip socks!!!. I HIGHLY recommend stopping by, you won‚Äôt regret it!

I was impressed how the owner and staff were constantly cleaning and disinfecting the play areas. They even have a machine that cleans and disinfects the balls in the ball pit. Socks are also free to borrow, and they even have crocs to ensure their cleanliness when using bathroom facilities.
I also appreciated the bins they offered for bags, and I felt comfortable leaving my purse there and not having to carry it around.
We were able to come in the morning, go home for lunch and a nap, then come back on our same play pass.

Review: I reserved Cypress Sam's Treehouse for my son's birthday. However, I ended up having to cancel the party due to the number of children and adults who were sick. I did not cancel the reservation for Cypress Sam's, though. My son's dad just left this past week and he was already a little sad, but having to cancel his party made things a bit worse. So, we decided to go to the Treehouse despite being the only ones there.

The staff were amazing. They understood why I had to cancel the party, but they jumped in and played with my two boys! They even convinced my oldest to go down the slide, which he had been afraid to do. One of the staff members made an AMAZING birthday card for my son from the Corkan staff. I greatly appreciate all of the staff involved, and I thank you all so much for making my son's day special!

Review: Awesome ü§© place to bring the little ones to get that much needed social interaction with other kids. The first level of three is where the adults can play with their kids. Levels 2 and above are for the children only. Unless help is needed. There are cool air machines inside the main area. It‚Äôs built like a fortress. Great for a game of Command and Conquer! There is no food allowed, which in my opinion will keep the place as clean as possible. Like it is now. Very clean and fresh! Wonderful staff also.

My complaint and why I gave it 2 stars is because the place is really dirty. It definitely NEEDS a deep clean or something, especially when they want us to not wear shoes in there, it definitely makes me feel icky. Although it seems like a fun place, but please maintain it better in regards to having it be cleaned.

Review: I came here with my kids and my sister and her kids. I loved it, and so did the kids. If I can point out one thing. Y'all have to advertise that this indoor kids play house is on a military base and you have to get to the visitors center on the other side to get passes for however long you will be there. And they require the everyone over the age of 17 or 18 has to have a day pass as well. For the people that don't know the area well, this is what you must do. My sister looked this place up and nowhere did it say they were located on a military base. Great little place though to let our kids blow off some energy!! üëç

My suggestion to management is to have people sign in at the time they arrived and give them 2 hours of play. So the same people aren't there for 3/4 plus hours keeping it at full capacity and others can't come in and leave with screaming disappointed children.

Review: The place overall was nice but they should do a better job at cleaning the facility. The yellow mesh inside of the treehouse is filled with lint and dust. Once the basket tips over from the top it dumps the lint and dust a little bit at a time. I‚Äôve said something to the staff before and they said that it‚Äôll be cleaned that weekend. That was definitely not the case because the particles were still there three weeks later. The next time your in there just go inside of the clear vinyl door strips of the treehouse and look up. It‚Äôll only be a matter of time before someone is effected but their lack of cleaning

Review: I had the opportunity to take my 1-year-old here last week and he absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a fun, engaging space for little ones to explore and play. However, I do think it would be beneficial to have a designated area that separates babies from the older kids. I noticed a few smaller babies getting accidentally bumped by bigger kids, and that could become a safety concern over time.

The food menu is limited, which is understandable, but adding kid-friendly options like pizza or PB&J sandwiches would be a great addition for the age groups they serve. Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place with a lot of potential, and we‚Äôll likely be back!

Review: I love bringing my two and three-year-old to this cafe. It's a place I frequently visit with my husband or other mommies. The atmosphere is very clean, and I always look forward to their delicious vanilla lattes and waffles! The staff behind the counter consistently greet everyone with smiles and work their tails off to serve us. The location is also low sensory which I appreciate as a former special education advocate.

While the location is a bit cramped, I believe this is partly due to families placing their belongings on the tables, which can limit space, especially for those who are dining. It would be wonderful if patrons could utilize the cubbies provided to help create a more enjoyable dining experience for everyone. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial if parents could take a more active role in supervising their children and encouraging them to return items to their proper places. My daughter loves playing in the kitchen area, but it often seems empty. Parents joining their kids on the slide should bear in mind that they move all the balls when they slide down. My son hit his head on the back of the slide because the balls had been removed from a parent sliding down.

I truly believe that creating a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility within our community. If you‚Äôre visiting, it would be wonderful if you could encourage your little one to practice responsibility. I also wish there were opportunities to explore memberships! Otherwise, great location!

Review: We loved this place. It is so much bigger than you would think from outside the building. Once you get in and in the play area it's got so many levels with slides, swings, etc. I love how the second level has slides. My kids loved everything about it, the ball pit, slides, swings, etc. At first I thought the 2 hour play time was going to be a waste of money but I was wrong. We definitely got our money's worth within the first hour there. Everything was so clean. We will definitely be going back.

We came here because of their sick policy and the reports of it being so clean. I really appreciate those two things. We'll for sure be back, because even though we were there for 1.5 hours, my toddler didn't even get to everything they had to offer.

Review: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Absolutely Amazing!

Playland is hands down the best indoor playground and caf√© we‚Äôve ever visited! From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed space. The play area is a paradise for kids ‚Äì colorful, engaging, and packed with fun activities like slides, ball pits, and climbing structures that kept my little ones entertained for hours.

What really sets Playland apart is the attention to detail. The caf√© is a lifesaver for parents, offering delicious coffee (the caramel Blondie and there waffles is a must-try!), snacks, and a cozy place to relax while keeping an eye on the kids. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and always making sure everyone is having a great time.

The environment feels safe and welcoming, with plenty of seating and space for families to enjoy together. Whether you‚Äôre planning a playdate, hosting a birthday party, or just need a fun outing for the kids, Playland is the perfect spot.

Highly recommend to anyone in the Mooresville area or even beyond ‚Äì it‚Äôs worth the trip! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon.

Review: A decent place to take your kids to play they have a variety of things there however it could be bigger myself and my husband expected it to be so it's a little small however it makes the kids happy so it was good family fun. They have a cafe, with plenty of drinks and snacks, very pricey tho but you're not allowed to bring food or drinks from outside in. They have slides, obstacle courses, ball pits, little cars and play mat areas and different things to do with your child or let them explore on there own. U do have to sign a waiver in case of injury and are required to have socks on, no shoes in play area or bare feet. It's for 2 hour intervals unless you buy a package for a party or something then you can stay longer I believe. Would recommend, and we'll be going back, however I'll just keep drinks and snacks in car!

My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù was a child had a potty accident in the play area and a female worker made an announcement about checking your kid‚Äôs diaper or taking them potty. I felt that was a little petty and definitely embarrassed the mom as I was in the bathroom while she was changing the child and you could tell she was upset.

Review: I enjoy bringing my 16 month old baby here during the week when it tends to be slow, however we brought her recently when there were more older kids running around. The kids were super rowdy, chasing one another around and pelting each other with balls both inside and outside of the ball pit (I got hit hard in the side of the head). They kept climbing up the slides and the parents were way more interested in socializing amongst each other than actually parenting their kids. An announcement was made regarding the kids' behavior, but unfortunately none of us could understand what was being said over the loudspeaker and nothing was done by employees OR parents when the behavior continued. We didn't feel it was safe for our baby to keep playing so we left after about an hour, which felt like a waste of money, as we usually stay for the full two hours. We love Playland, but it would be so much better if there were designated areas by age group, or at least if the rules of safe play were actually enforced. Also, after a few times of coming, we've never once seen employees disinfecting the play area, and as another reviewer mentioned, the baby changing table in the women's restroom isn't bolted to the counter, so it slides around if you have a squirmy baby. We'll still keep coming here, but I was disappointed by our most recent visit.

Review: I like the place, great atmosphere for my toddler who‚Äôs new to everything. We go at least twice a week and last week went a total of 3 times. My only issue is when I mentioned to the staff twice in the first 30 minutes of being there, that there was a child visibly sick, coughing all over kids and my daughter, wiping snot all over the place, they said they were going to handle it and never did. The next morning my daughter woke up with an extremely high fever and ill. Took her to the doctor that hour and she had gotten hand foot and mouth. My boyfriend called and told them this as a precaution to clean extra that way no other kid got it- and they basically said they don‚Äôt single kids out and hope my kid gets better- odd response. I get it- kids get sick, I knew that going into these types of facilities almost impossible to clean every  germ away; but don‚Äôt put on your website you will be asked to leave if sick, and then do the exact opposite. It‚Äôs not singling kids out to ask a family to not bring snotty, coughing kids in. Otherwise great place

She had a fever for six days in a row and we‚Äôre now on week two of being sick. I cannot stress enough as a parent please please do not take your children to these types of places if they‚Äôre sick.

Review: Much calmer version of the Monroe favorite. This is probably a good entry point for kids who have not yet experienced the mega masterpiece of sensory intensity of its sister store or younger ones 3 and under. All light and bright, more open, less kids, freshly opened location, easier total vantage points. Kids seem generally caper, a little more sheltered, happy, but overall the experience is not as energy draining bright or intense as the southern Playland. It is a different day, it is a calm independent play be a kid without the gladiator dome or extreme challenges such as rope climbing, air ball shooters, 4 stories of the sister store.

They have 4 rooms for parties that seem to be a good size and a large area at the front with a lot of tables for both kids and adults to use. Tons of climbing areas, a ball pit, trampolines etc for kids to choose from. My daughter loves the carousel swing while my son's favorite is the trampoline area. There are a couple spots with big screen tvs that play kid-safe/friendly shows too. It's a great place for them to burn energy and have fun for a couple hours.

Review: Very clean playgym with a ton of fun equipment. However, it has issues. First of all the food/kitchen menu is basically fake. In theory, they serve both coffee and hot food, but in reality, there's never actually staff to prepare it. I've been here 10+ times. Just don't expect any food except packaged snacks.

Secondly, why is there a huge movie screen playing cartoons??? Who thought this was a good idea at a playgym? If I wanted my toddler to sit and watch Disney movies, we do that at home for free.

Too bad for these poor management decisions. High Five could be great! But right now there is zero reason to visit when you can drive 10m down Independence & go to Playland instead.

Review: Hosted a party here for my son and the kids had a blast. They do, however, need to work on logistics. We arrived 30 minutes before start time and they said we needed to wait until 15-20 minutes prior‚Äîno problem. The email stated we‚Äôd have a room attendant which we did not have. No grip socks included for my party guests. The food came and no one announced or told us it was there so by the time the kids got to it‚Äîit was cooling off. The same happened with their sweet treats at the end. No announcement, no notifying the parents‚Äîjust dropped it off to melt and walked off. The only time someone came and communicated directly with me was at the end when they wanted me to check out and pay them. For the prices they charge they should be way more accommodating to families hosting parties. If you‚Äôre going just for kids to play 6 and under it‚Äôs a good option with accessibility for the smaller kids. I‚Äôve hosted multiple kids parties and this was the least impressive experience on that front.

Review: Great spot for kids! We went recently for a 2 yr olds birthday party and everyone has a good time. There's something to do for kids of pretty much all ages... my 18 month old enjoyed herself just as much of my 9 year old. It can be a little chaotic as kids can run around independently while parents can choose to watch from the sidelines. So you just have to be extra watchful of the smaller kids to make sure the bigger ones dont run them over. The location would have been hard to find of the party host didnt specifically tell everyone it was behind the At Home store, because if you simply type the address in the GPS you would end up at the front door of the At Home store. Overall it was a great time, I would visit again!

Review: It‚Äôs a very spacious clean and fun playground with beautiful displays. However when you book a party (which is very expensive)they expect you and all your guests to be out of the entire facility in the two hour window. They also failed to put the correct amount of chairs knowing the number of guests that had signed in about an hour prior to seat for pizza and cake. The number of chairs was not updated in time. One of my guests felt left out because they took a long time to bring the chair and the little one stepped out crying. It was not a fun experience for my guest and I‚Äôm very unhappy about that.

Review: Not worth the money üëéüèª biased because I‚Äôve been to other indoor playgrounds, and this was most definitely at the bottom of my list. Parents aren‚Äôt allowed to go down the beautiful big slide they have and that really threw me for a loop since my child wanted to go down together. There was also paper signs multiple places saying that adults couldn‚Äôt go on or use areas as well as other paper signs to not lean on furniture etc. This just tells me you bought cheap furniture but charge an expensive price to get through the door. Not to mention, the cafe was not stocked with any food or snacks in the cases and when asked for a cup of coffee well over an hour before their closing time, we had been told the machine was already shut down for the day. They only offer 2 hour passes and within 30 minutes of not being able to join my toddler on things, we were ready to go but stayed since we had already paid for it. I‚Äôm sure people enjoy it here but in my opinion, spend your money elsewhere. The place was also clean, which was nice. The gate at the front had been left open a couple times and had to keep redirecting my toddler to not run away.

Everything is soft sided so you can feel good about kids trying new things without getting hurt. Didn‚Äôt try any food or anything, but was impressed with how much my kid enjoyed it.

Review: We really enjoyed this place. My children are 1 year and 4 years old. Both kids had a great time. The playground was built in such a way that I could always visually make sure that everything was fine with my eldest and that she was having a great time, while I stayed close to my youngest daughter the whole time. Clean, beautiful, lots of fun for children. For two children it turned out to be about $35 for 2 hours, which is above average, but the day was cloudy, and most importantly the daughters had a great time.

You can book your time online, but it is not necessary. The first time I booked, the subsequent ones came simply when they wanted to play. But in the second case, it is worth considering that if the site is overcrowded, you may be refused, which has never happened to us.

There is an area for smaller toddlers to play as well. Every surface is soft so no problem if anyone falls down. They have 4 private birthday rooms. Grownups are allowed to play too. They just can't go on the trampolines or slides.I recommend.

Review: Came to High five for an afternoon play date. We had a blast! We went around 4PM on a Friday. Everything was clean. Even made me more excited to see people actively cleaning as we were playing. The only reason I took off one star is because the price is a bit steep for a 2 hour playtime. I only brought one of my two kids but I can‚Äôt imagine a family paying for more than 2 kids. This place is definitely geared to kids 10 and under. They have little baby sections for little ones to play on. Socks are required which is great! Hand sanitizer stations posted everywhere and lots of spaces for parents to sit out and chill. Even a place for parents who need to charge their phones, use their computers, or even moms to plug up to pump. They also have a cafe that serves food. We were going out to eat afterwards so we didn‚Äôt get to use those services. It overall we enjoyed and though the price is higher than others, we will be back!

Review: The establishment is clean, and maintained well, it was not very busy today which was nice,   Removed stars for not having any saftey measures for kids leaving with correct adults and the gate to the exit was not consistently shut either and the front door wouldn‚Äôt completely shut either   ‚Ä¶ when we got here it was so hot inside everyone was sweating even people sitting down- I personally bumped the ac to a comfortable level bc no employees were‚Ä¶ overpriced, (15 min down the road I can pay half of what I pay for 1 here )-  the food options are not healthy at all,   And there are tvs in multiple spots ‚Ä¶.  Which for some would be a  non issue but for people bringing kids who are screen free the kids just stare at the tv and video game tv  in the ball pit and barely play with the eqpt we overpaid for.  ‚Ä¶. Not allowed to go down the slide with the toddler. Means  we now have to keep redirecting away from the slide and this one loves slides. The ‚Äúlittle‚Äù slides are great for 6-9 month olds, but not 2 year olds.  the spinning car thing has broken pedals  it was not a horrible time, but it def could be better

Review: We usually go to Playland but came here with our friends a few weeks ago instead since it's closer to our home. With a 4 year old, for a few dollars more than Playland, she had a fantastic time. Absolutely loved all the play equipment. It felt pretty clean, was very spacious, had more things that parents could sit on closer to the kids if they needed help, and truly it was worth the extra dollar or two above Playland to not have to drive all the way down there.
However, the one negative thing I would say is that there's absolutely no security measures for the children or parents. There's no name tags to double check and make sure you're bringing your child out with you or someone else's kid. I felt very concerned the entire time that I had to keep a lookout near the door and make sure no creeps had come in.
Would really appreciate it if you guys have a name system and check on the tags before the parents and children leave. Playland does that.

Review: I‚Äôve visited High-five Playhouse twice now and my son and I really enjoy it. My son recently had a birthday party there last weekend and we had overall a good experience but I do wish our party host told us to leave in a kinder manner. Our party was over at 12 and we were out of the play area by 12:15. The party room was completely empty by 12 pm. We were on the side where the chairs were by 12:15 gathering last minute things but by 12:20 our party host came to me and told us we had to leave now and was very rude about it. I understand that we were still in the building 20 mins after party time but we were not in the party room or play area whatsoever.. just on the side gathering things and putting kids shoes on. I would understand more if the facility was busier or if we were in anyone‚Äôs way but like I mentioned, our party room was empty and the next party hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. At 12:20 the building alone wasn‚Äôt even as busy as it was 30 mins prior. I‚Äôm really big on customer service and I wish our birthday party experience didn't end that way. I also wish they wouldn‚Äôt tell us to start packing up 15 mins before our party time ends which cuts us short of our 2hours that we have booked. I wish they had longer slots in between parties to avoid people from feeling rushed to leave.

The staff is always so helpful and I feel they go above and beyond as far as cleanliness and making you feel right at home! Anna Bay was a true gem. She took care of all the details for me! I could enjoy my three-year-old daughter's party without having to worry about a thing! Would highly recommend!

Everything you need for all age children, the bathroom is fully equipped for all ages as well. There‚Äôs even a cute little nursing area! The perfect place to enjoy your lunch while the kids run free! My daughter loved the ball pit the most! We will for sure be stopping back in to stretch our legs on future roadtrips!

The staff was super friendly and made us feel welcome right away. Everything felt really safe and well-organized, which gave me peace of mind while the kids played freely.

It‚Äôs the perfect place for open play, rainy days, or just letting the little ones burn off some energy. My nieces didn‚Äôt want to leave! We‚Äôll definitely be coming back.

Review: I came here with my daughter. I see that this place needs to upgrade and repair many things. The most worrying thing is that the slide is not good when sliding in a supine position to the end of the path or the baby bumps his head on the floor. The staff should pay attention to review this part. I went to Giggle Town where they gave away free socks for parents and children, more games and an entry price of only $10 for unlimited hours. This place has limited hours and the ticket price includes tax of $16 and 1 candy here is sold for $4. You can see ‚ÄúGiggle Town‚Äù they make a lot of games. My comment here is that I want the business to develop and provide better quality service. Although you guys are doing very well, you also need to change to be better and better for customers. I give you 5*, support you, great friends and hope you do better for the little angels and for the community. Thank you

Review: We went for the first time yesterday and I loved it my daughter had an amazing time. I will say it‚Äôs pricey. $17 to play for two hours is expensive and I don‚Äôt think it should be that much in comparison to other places locally / within the state. I will say better attention needs to be added into the 24M and younger area. Yesterday there was a ridiculous amount of older kids in the play area meant for small kids and no parent in sight correcting them until it was to late. The service for drinks is pretty slow they need more staff

Review: I expected more. Empanadas were very dry and hard, ordered 3 orders between my sister and my friend. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Ended up throwing most away. My oldest daughter (who is 5) was helping me with my one year old in the under 2 area, and while my oldest was only sitting on the floor not saying a word, asked her to get out of the area since it‚Äôs for 2 and under only. I get the rules but it‚Äôs not like she was being rowdy or obnoxious she was literally sitting beside her sister.
Also, my friend and I came in about 10 mins apart, and my time was up (barely) and we‚Äôre already being asked (my friends time wasn‚Äôt up yet) if we were leaving or paying another hour. There isn‚Äôt a clock in sight. I won‚Äôt be back. As much as I wanted to support Latinx owned businesses. üíî

Review: Super nice place for babies and small children. Everything is super well thought out for your safety and fun. They also have food and coffee for sale so parents can have a pleasant time.
You can pay for an hour or more on the spot or online. The first time they ask you to do it online, from their website, but it is very easy.
The requirement for children is that they wear grippy socks with rubber bands.
Even I wanted to be a girl again to enjoy the games ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Review: Sock store disguised as a play area.

After signing the standard waiver before entering, stating that if my child is injured - it's on me - my 2 year old lost one of his socks (grippy socks tlarw required at all times for play - I bought my own from home).

He lost the sock in their foam pit (because the grippy part stuck to the foam), I was told he could no longer play without both socks - but they would conveniently 'sell' me a pair of socks.

Adults are not allowed in the foam pit ...so I couldn't go in to look for the sock and no member of staff offered to help find it either.

Review: Cute little place to take kids! My son is 2.5 and loves it! You will need grip socks for the kids, they have them for $4 but I suggest you buy your own since it‚Äôs more economical. Posting a pic of the socks so you buy something comparable. Certain grip socks aren‚Äôt allowed I don‚Äôt believe going by the other reviews. The place is very clean, I went around lunch time on a Friday. Not overcrowded, calm music playing, they have a ball pit and a sandbox which is a plus. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is one of the workers. The light skin mixed looking woman. She reminded me of a prison guard. She is one of the girls making sure we don‚Äôt go over our time, she was not friendly at all, no smile, not welcoming. Not sure if she was having a bad day which we all have our days so I get it but you should have a friendly personality if you‚Äôre working somewhere involving children. The rest of the staff was very nice! Let me also add if this is your first time going you will need to book online. I suggest doing that before you get there

Review: It‚Äôs a nice place, albeit a little small. I have a 2 1/2 year old and thought the place would be better suited for younger kids. There‚Äôs only one slide, and as expected, some parents are not keeping an eye on their kids, leading to kids climbing up the slide while 3 others are going down. The lack of supervision is not the fault of Unwind, but I do think they should have someone monitoring, instead of having 4 employees hanging out behind the coffee bar. There weren‚Äôt enough balls in the ball-pit/slide area.

Also, you HAVE to buy their socks. We went the Monday after their grand opening and nowhere was it listed that you had to buy their socks. On the way out, they do have a box where you can choose to donate your $4 socks so they can wash and resell. I kept mine. Check-in took forever, but it was only their second day of being open, so I hope they find a better and more efficient way of getting people in quickly.

FYI - they don‚Äôt have iced coffee.

UPDATE - so I wanted to give this place another chance. I went to their online site to book a ticket and was absolutely shocked on their new prices. $24.99 for TWO HOURS OF PLAY? I went six months ago and paid $16 for TWO HOURS. That is a $9 increase in six months. That‚Äôs a 56% increase in price. I was completely floored and astounded on how crazy expensive it got. Did they add new activities? Are they giving away stuff for free at the door? In 6 months, I don‚Äôt know what justifies that. They have outpriced themselves out of the indoor playground market.

Review: $12.99 for one hour of play is very expensive, especially if you are bringing multiple children. My baby had his own grip socks (that were brand new and clean) and the guy at the front desk made me buy THEIR grip socks. For an extra $6. Cost me close to $20 for an hour of play, and that was for one almost 2 year old. My 8 year old daughter was at school and found out that we went and has been begging to go. Unfortunately not with those astronomical prices!

The only downside is that it was extremely packed. I feel like many of the kids were able to enjoy the areas as much as they could. For one hour time slots, I feel like they should have more of a limit on the number of kids per hour and not have the times overlapping so much.
It would give the staff more opportunity to keep areas cleaned and the children better enjoyment of the areas.

Review: This place has slipped a bit since they first opened. Unwind is advertised as a sensory play area for all kids, but especially sensitive toward kids with autism.  At the beginning we loved it for exactly that reason. But recently it seems that they do not have any control over the capacity. I went while unbeknownst to me, there was a birthday party going on and that room was packed with people....not to mention the tons of regular customers. There were children well over 7 years old (their limit) running around like crazy people, uncontrolled by their parents and the handful of employees that were there were barely able to keep the balls in the pit because of how out of control these kids were. Aside frome that, small children were getting pushed around as the older ones carelssly ran by them (nothing happened to my 4 year old, thankfully). I feel as if a family should have to rent the whole space out for whatever amount of hours they will be there and not mix other customers in.

I thought since the price was so high there would be fewer people. Nope, I could barely walk due to the amount of adults and children. No way could I enjoy a coffee or even sit down at this place. Maybe the weekdays are better?  Also their sock requirement didn‚Äôt really make any sense to me. I likely won‚Äôt return.

Review: My kids have been ill for the past 14 days after a little girl sneezed and coughed directly in my babies face. My toddler almost had to go to the hospital for dehydration from being so ill.
There were so many actively and obviously sick children in the play area. The employees are absolutely overrun by the numbers of families there. Seems like the owners would rather have a higher profit than care about screening illness out.
The rules are very clear, do not bring sick children. But it is ultimately up to the employees to deny entry to inconsiderate parents who try to bring their sick children.

Posting IG videos of your employees cleaning the equipment isn‚Äôt going to do anything when the place is overrun by actively sick children.

During Covid, people screened temps and looked for signs of sickness before admitting people into places. I would be perfectly fine with these policies in place.

Just 1 hour and the staff literally walk around and tap you and say that your time is up would you like to pay for another hour. I have never had that happen at any other place I‚Äôve ever taken my child so if you have more than 1 child you would be paying almost $60 for 2 hours of play that‚Äôs pretty pricey. I think that if an 2 hour minimum was added it would have been better

Review: I know this place is near and my son enjoyed it but the price for the time doesn't seem to match. Then they require you to only wear their socks so please don't forget to bring them if returning. My son enjoyed the sand pit but looking around there were some people around with times that should have been up but 5 mins before my time is up staff reminded me if I stayed over 10 mins I would have to buy another hour. There is no discount for buying multiple hours at one time or anything and I couldn't imagine paying the price double. Decent amount of seating but also lots of people which means a lot of standing. The set up seems cheaply made from the fence that's wobbly to the mining wall by the sand pit, and the floor with socks on is hard on your feet.

Review: Edited: Such a salty response from the business owner. I am not a fake account, only a customer and a mom who is looking for a nice experience for my children, as well as support a woman-owned business. But the owner's reply leaves much to be desired. I am a loyal customer with Playland because they run their business well, are kind and welcoming to all customers, and make sure their equipment and play areas are clean and safe. By the way, I was not solicited or asked by Playland to mention their name or wrote a review. They are an honest business and wouldn‚Äôt engage in this weird and combative behavior.

So sorry that the owner cannot be a professional and apologize for the poor treatment I experienced‚Ä¶
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
While my kids enjoyed their play experience, I think charging $12.99 per child for one hour is very expensive, and there were no discounts for siblings.  Also, I felt their equipment was not as sturdy, especially in the baby/24 month area where the climbing thing was loose.

I ordered some items from their cafe, and they forgot to charge me for the water. While I was feeding my 2 year old, I was not aware that my hot chocolate was ready. An employee came to me and brought a credit card reader and said ‚Äúwe forgot to charge you for the water, please pay.‚Äù I was shocked because I was frazzled as I was feeding my toddler while trying to watch my other kids. They said I had to go to the counter to pay. I told them I had to feed my kid, and they offered to watch her so I can pay. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable so I had to drag my child all the way to the register - this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. It felt like they wanted to nickel and dime me when it‚Äôs THEIR fault. Not coming back again, I am sticking to Playland in Monroe.

Review: We visited this place for the first time the other day. My 3 year old had a blast with her friend! So many different themed ‚Äúrooms‚Äù and very clean. Ashley was working this day and she was fabulous!! She learned their names, and was especially kind when we were trying to get the girls to leave. She went out of her way to help stop the crying snd make sure they left happy. Definitely recommend!

Review: This place is awesome! I'm surprised that this isn't being advertised everywhere around town! Stumbled upon it today as I went to help my daughter search for job in the mall and ended up taking my 2 toddler boys here and boy did they have a blast! The owner was very friendly and I'm grateful to have found this gym for the boys! Definitely want to take them at least once a week!

Review: Adventure Town comes highly recommended from my family and me! They have numerous stations for kids, they even have a gated area exclusively for babies 0-12m which for me is very thoughtful of them, and the staff ensures each one is clean and organized. Also, a big thank you to the staff who helped my husband locate his misplaced phone. It wasn't their responsibility to help, but they went above and beyond, searching every station. Fortunately, he found it, and the staff even called to ensure he had it back. Thank you, Adventure Town staff!

Ashley was working this day and she was fabulous!! She learned their names, and was especially kind when we were trying to get the girls to leave. She went out of her way to help stop the crying snd make sure they left happy. Definitely recommend!

Review: Adventure Town comes highly recommended from my family and me! They have numerous stations for kids, they even have a gated area exclusively for babies 0-12m which for me is very thoughtful of them, and the staff ensures each one is clean and organized. Also, a big thank you to the staff who helped my husband locate his misplaced phone. It wasn't their responsibility to help, but they went above and beyond, searching every station. Fortunately, he found it, and the staff even called to ensure he had it back. Thank you, Adventure Town staff!

Review: Neuro Nook is a game-changer for neurodivergent kids, offering a thoughtfully designed indoor playground that caters to their unique sensory needs. The staff's enthusiasm and understanding of neurodiversity create a welcoming environment that's both fun and calming. I'm thrilled to see our community becoming more progressive and accepting, and I highly recommend Neuro Nook to any family looking for an inclusive and supportive space.

I appreciate that there is an area just for toddlers if she needs a slower paced area too. That being said, my FAVORITE thing about bringing my toddler here is that it is so clean! There are constantly employees wiping the structure down, using a Swiffer to clean the floor, and rearranging the toddler space to keep it organized and accessible. I'm not even super concerned about germs, it's just THAT clean! It is $20 for 90 minutes of play. It isn't a cheap excursion, but it is so so worth it! We love this place!

Only downside was that I had to go wait in my care because the smell of the air fresheners is VERY strong and it made me super nauseous. Small space for so many air fresheners. It would be nice for them to open the door for some fresh air or get a natural air freshener like essential oils. We probably won't be returning due to the overuse of chemicals we have to breathe.

Review: The hive is very neat! This small town needed this after Polk county remolded the outdoor playgrounds. This is going to be a popular place on hot, rainy and cold days! This is a great indoor playground and has many sensory play area for little ones, plus a under 3 baby/toddler zone. They even have a semi private area that can be rented for parties. My 11 month old and 6 year each had there only spaces and had fun for hours. I also appreciate nit having to worry about big kids/teenagers running around and nocking into my child which is sometimes you find at parks and some of the larger indoor playground, jumping gyms.

There is different lanes for sensory and imagination play. Each of the 4 lanes are themed, under the sea, construction zone, outdoor/picnic, and house/doll. The only call out is we noticed the bottom baseboard in the lanes had a rough texture, so if not careful, could get a splinter. All the other boards in the place were smooth and laquered.

Something to note, we hadn't been before they moved the baby zone but talking to some parents, they voiced they didn't like how small it is now. The baby zone used to be where the party area is now. Parents were saying there was more room for them to run around and spread out. On the other hand I could understand the need for larger party area to accommodate larger parties. I didn't mind the baby area and we there on Sunday afternoon after the church crowd. The only thing I didn't like was the net gate used to act as a baby safety gate. Toddlers were climbing over it, under it and around it where it's only attached and hooked at the bottom. Looks broke. Would like to see a solid 3' wall with a swinging gate like at the entrance of the place.

There are a few adult games scattered about, table games like checkers, Jenga and chess. There are large yard games like corn hole, connect 4, tick tac toe.

There is plenty of tables with metal bar stool seats. I personally would have liked to see lower seating with back support that is more children friendly and more comfortable for parents to lounge while the kids play. However they do have two leather futon couches and 4 cushioned arm chairs towards the stage, set up in two living room style sets. There are also plenty of high chairs for babies and they looked clean!

The hive offers WiFi and a variety of refreshments and snacks. I had one of there nitro coffees (never had before) but was very good and creamy. The flavoring range is surprisingly amazing if you are willing to be adventurous and try new things. The also offer craft sodas, teas, and traditional coffee drinks you get at a coffee shop. There is ice cream, we got the waffle bubble and it was so yummy. So much ice cream for the $7. So worth it. There are snacks starting at $1, chips, gummies, dunkaroos, etc.

My daughter keeps asking me when we are going to go back again. Great hangout place, for. Both parents and kids. A little bit of everything for everyone.

Review: 17 hour drive to get to our vacation spot. We decided to stop here to let our 23 month old burn off her energy. It was super fun, so much to do for so many different age groups! The only reasoning for a 4 star is that it could be a tad bit cleaner. I work with kiddos for a living, it‚Äôs cleaning constantly to keep up with them lol. But again, maybe get in those hard to reach places that kiddos could potentially reach.
Otherwise it was so fun, decently priced, lots to do. I also loved how it was right there on the main road we were driving on!

Review: **Theft- Odd Occurence**
This was a very unique experience if I must say so,odd behavior. First, I'll speak on the part room,it was not clean there were still pizza crust and crumbs or what not left behind from the previous party. The attendant oddly was not very attentive,not very engaged at all,however I will say towards the end they perked up,you could see a personality, I guess maybe it was just a long day. Overall the play areas were super congested,almost somewhat a challenge to move around,anyhow my kid enjoyed the playtime. Moving on one of my dear guest lost their wallet while over by the slides where the neated areas are. So he goes to report it and or to see if someone turned it in,luckily one of the young ladies at the front said her co-worker had just mentioned something about a wallet being found but she was not sure of what she did with it. Young lady at the front scans the floor and attempted to reach the girl via walkie talkie,no luck. Anyhow the girl who found the wallet appears and said yes she found one but gave it to someone,then she said well it was some lady and then proceeded to look for her(my guest is walking with her). The lady is found and states to the girl(worker) that the wallet you gave me was purple,see (proceeds to show the wallet). Ok so at this point I'm confused and clearly someone is lying because now the worker doesn't recall the color of the wallet
(brown mens wallet) nor anything else. Spoke with the lead(caucasian lady) up front with the short pixie cut. Security got involved,police were called and the tape was viewed,however oddly there was footage of every area surrounding to the left and right of the slide except for front view of the slide itself where the incident occurred,it was completely distorted,not visible.  Alright after all that,the wallet appears,one of the customers brings it to the front,the only thing left that was left in it was the ID. Ok so at this point there was nothing else we could do about it,note: the police officer did agree that the footage appeared to be altered.This just really ruined the time for myself and my parents at this point AND keep in mind it's only a 2hr party so they/ we practically spent most of the time with the staff/officers in reference to this issue,more money wasted!! Here is the kicker, today March 31,2025 someone from Newtopia called and said ""hey we have a ziploc bag that you left behind with your business cards and etc""!  I am in complete disbelief. So you mean to tell me we went from,no wallet,to found empty wallet,to oh we found a bag you left behind with your cards in it,you can come get it! So he goes to get the bag from Newtopia AND they say well no,we can't give it to you,you will have to wait until the other lady is in tomorrow. A manager is requested and  he refused to come out to speak about the matter or release the remaining items.  This seems to possibly be some type of inside mess going on,maybe one of the workers had his things the entire time. I don't know however what I do know is there is definitely foul play here. I guess the thief felt bad and brought back everything but the money and credit cards,wow!! Needless to say I want be patronizing this establishment anymore. Ruined my time with my girl and guest with this foolery.

Review: I attended the Halloween event on 10/25/ 2024 and it was not worth the price. I think the event should have been the regular price and here's why I say that. The event was from 5-7, which is okay. The cotton candy machine ended up breaking, there were 3 cars for the trunk and treat and the kids had to get 1 piece of candy a piece. There were only two girls' face painting and time went by so fast that the kids weren‚Äôt able to get their faces painted. The kids enjoyed playing, but they weren‚Äôt able to get the other incentives that were offered at the event.

Review: Overall the concept is everything. Big open and lots to do to keep the littles busy. I gave it a mid rating though because in times like these cleanliness is truly next to godliness. The place is horrid filthy. It is utterly disgusting and crawling with germs. I know that germs are to be expected in most public kiddie play places but this place is performing very poorly. There is visible dirt, sticky spots, likely snot spots on lots of the toys. We stayed almost all day and had not seen a single employee clean or disinfect a single area. The little toy houses are so gross they need to just toss them out. The blocks were broken chewed through foam. I would think the owners would be checking in to ensure it‚Äôs being up kept since the idea is ideal for families especially me a stay at home mom who would‚Äôve been likely to visit regularly throughout the week to tire my littles. They need to close for a good week or two replace some things, do a deep cleanse, even get rid of some of the phone cuties that work there but aren‚Äôt working only playing in their phones not paying attention to anything. There were also visible dangers I noted with some of the moving equipment so I made sure to warn other parents and keep my babies away. Oh and not to mention there needs to be blockers put on the shooting ball games so kids who weren‚Äôt raised to not harm others are able to shoot the balls at other littles smh. Overall this could be a really good spot to visit but it needs a bunch of tlc immediately. The care seems to have left the building. We didn‚Äôt really partake in the party rooms or food bar area. The area wasn‚Äôt very clean either. And the same girls playing on phones not sanitizing or anything are back and forth from front register to that area. I didn‚Äôt see any employee hand washing going on. I wanna love this place because my babies did but lord knows I washed the heck out of them ‚Äúcheered‚Äù when we got home. Lol. Wishing this business more success attached to its care level.

Review: I recently visited Newtopia in Montgomery with my kids, and while the staff was wonderful and the play areas were fun, I was really disappointed with the ball area to the right when you walk in. There‚Äôs a video game in that section that, once chosen, can‚Äôt be exited out of. The game involves hitting people with guns to win, which is incredibly shocking to find in a children‚Äôs play area. While there‚Äôs a note advising not to pick that game, there was no warning when something was already running before entering the room. I don‚Äôt think this type of content is appropriate for any age group, despite what the label says. It‚Äôs something that really needs to be addressed for the safety and well-being of all kids who play here. I have included a photo of screen with the inappropriate game.

If the Managers would learn & teach the staff this is a Children‚Äôs playground not a Club I think we would like it more.

A must for hot or rainy days when the kids just need a good outlet to pour their energy into. Parents can play on the soft indoor jungle gym or find a quiet-ish seat in the Cafe area.

Review: Today was the first time I visited this establishment with my two-year-old grandson. The facility is nice and I love how it is set up. But my problem is when elementary and preteen age children are taking over the area where  small children , toddlers and/or special needs children should be able to play and enjoy themselves. The older children had no regard for the little ones . Some of the older children running around bumping into the smaller children . It was really ridiculous . Any parent would be upset. I had to say something to staff . There was no regular monitoring going on in this area. Please encourage your staff take more effort  to ensure that the area where toddlers special needs and/or smaller children is monitored properly, safe and on a regular basis. The facility was not crowded this morning so there‚Äôs no excuse. Please do better thank you.

I was bouncing on a trampoline when all of a sudden I fell through the damn thing and was stuck underneath the trampoline for 3 HOURS. I mean cmon can we get a grip over there. I had to have the fire department get me out because I was so deeply stuck. When I got out I went to the bathroom when I saw twins making out (brother and sister). It made me a little bit uncomfy but whatever you guys do you. I then did my business in there and went in the foam pit. That was the stickiest foam pit I have ever been in. We need to get the cleaning crew in there. It is starting to get a little ridiculous. Anyways Bill out #shermp

Review: Decent place to bring younger kids. Hours are kind of weird as most people don‚Äôt even get off of work and home til 6 so seeing later hours throughout the week would be great. Only issue is staff does their closing stuff while customers are still in the building and they shut off the games and machines 20+ minutes before closing. You definitely feel rushed to get out although you paid a decent price per kid for the hours they have posted. If your hours state you are open until 7 allot an extra 30+ minutes to have your staff clean after customers have left the building instead of while they are trying to enjoy the last 30 minutes with their kids. While staff is occupied getting their end of shift list done it leaves the counters unattended. I get it‚Äôs a kids place you should be cleaning things all day but cutting the machines off plus running loud machines just makes it feel like ‚Äú get out‚Äù also with punch card some staff will punch one per kid while others punch one per visit. And when asked about their monthly membership most answers from staff ‚Äú I‚Äôm not sure you would have to wait and ask our boss one day when she‚Äôs here‚Äù..

Review: I wish more people knew about this place: My 6 year old daughter and I always have a good time. We tend to stay for hours at a time and she makes new friends every time and dreads leaving.

Seems like most all indoor play places have closed down these days, and the nearest ones are just expensive arcades or indoor trampoline parks‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll need to drive 45 minutes one way. üëéüèª

The staff here are friendly, polite, always working, cleaning, sanitizing, always attentive. They seem to only employ good people to work here. They also have good snacks and small simple meals on-hand (chicken tenders, hot dogs, etc), affordable toy vending machines, and high quality coffee!

It‚Äôs a good, secure place to go to relax, get out of the rain, or the heat, or the cold, and let the kids run free. Safely.

It‚Äôs like $15 for all-day admission. You can‚Äôt beat it. You can also host children‚Äôs Birthday Parties here! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Review: Kids Play and Cafe is hands-down the best place to bring my two-year-old! It‚Äôs the perfect spot for him to run off all that toddler energy in a safe and fun environment. The play area is clean, well-organized, and full of activities that keep him engaged for hours. What I love most is how it helps him build his social skills‚Äîhe‚Äôs constantly interacting with other little ones, learning to share, take turns, and make new friends. The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the cafe is a great bonus for parents to relax while still keeping an eye on the kiddos. We‚Äôre always excited to come back. Highly recommend for anyone with young children!

Review: Very kid friendly place, its all about kids big or little. I would definitely say its not recommended for kids 13+ in my opinion as its mostly little kids and just a park big enough to keep kids under 13 occupied for a good bit. They also have a smaller playground for kids 3 and under which is really nice for anyone bring kids that are really small and big. There are 2 separate ball pits, a little car go round and a few role-playing houses for kids to play with each other. They have a caf√© dedicated to small kids but still good enough for adults to put something small in their stomachs. There is a breastfeeding area in case women want privacy and 2 separate areas for parents to relax while kids play. There are a few machines to win prizes and some from what I can tell are guaranteed wins. There are 2 separate rooms for parties and they seem to have a lot of events going on to keep the fun going and different (like a ms Rachel meet and egg hunt). I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Yea its a little messy from kids playing throughout the day but that's to be expected... they're kids. It gets cleaned up nonetheless.

One of our favorite things about it is how autism-friendly it is‚Äîthey even provide headphones for kids who need sound support, which was such a thoughtful touch.

The owner was absolutely amazing, communicating with us every step of the way. Even on the day of the party, she was there to ensure everything ran smoothly and that we had everything we needed. Her dedication and hard work were truly impressive!

The space was perfect for a fun, stress-free celebration, and we highly recommend it to any family looking for a welcoming and accommodating place for their child‚Äôs special day. We will definitely be back!

When it‚Äôs time to go, take off the Kid Caf√© socks, and send the kids home with their own clean socks. Wash the cute Caf√© socks for next time!

Review: This place is great for the kids to run and play however I do think their small caf√© is a bit pricey considering the items and what I could get elsewhere. Also i do think somone at the desk should watch the gates because a few small kids almost went out due to the gate being left open until a parent or another bystanding parent stopped them.  But with that being said my kids had a great time and we will be back just probably not for the Caf√©.

Review: Nestled in the heart of the charming city of Easley, there's a hidden gem that has quickly become a second home for my family, the original Kids Play and Caf√©.
As a stay-at-home mom new to Easley, I was on the lookout for a place where my two toddlers could play and socialize. After some searching, I stumbled upon this family-owned treasure, and it has been a game-changer for us.

Kids Play and Caf√© isn't just a play area; it's a warm, welcoming community. The staff are incredibly friendly and always go the extra mile to make you feel at home. And those Lotus energy drinks? They're simply unbeatable. The caf√© itself offers an exceptional experience every time, with a menu full of delicious options, including vegan and non-dairy choices.

The events they host each month are another highlight, adding even more excitement to our visits. If my toddlers had their way, they‚Äôd move in!

Review: This morning, my husband and I found ourselves staring at our two kids, feeling completely stumped on what to do with them. We live in Five Forks and have already checked off the Children's Museum and the Zoo. With the heat making the park a no-go and the age gap between our kids (6 and 2) complicating things, we needed a solution. In a moment of desperation, I googled ‚ÄúThings to do with kids in Greenville, SC‚Äù and stumbled upon Kids Play & Cafe in Easley, about 45 minutes away. The photos looked promising, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would hold their interest for more than five minutes. Still, I decided to give it a try.

Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs fantastic!

From the moment we walked in, I was impressed. We signed the waiver, paid the $30, and my kids eagerly ran off to explore. The space has plenty of spots to stash shoes and comfortable seating for parents to keep an eye on their little ones. The climbing jungle gym was a huge hit‚Äîit was designed perfectly for both my 2-year-old and 6-year-old, with various levels of difficulty. I was relieved to see that there were enough ways for kids to climb up and down without needing any help from the staff. Plus, there are several other areas specifically for toddlers to play safely.

I made sure the kids had a good lunch before we arrived, but the on-site cafe had a great selection of snacks, including organic Annie‚Äôs, candy, muffins, cupcakes, and drinks like bottled water, organic juices, and coffee. We enjoyed a cupcake, some Annie‚Äôs cheddar crackers, and a coffee while we were there.

The staff were exceptional‚Äîfriendly, attentive, and proactive. When my 2-year-old removed his socks, they quickly informed me he needed to get them back on or he'd have to miss out on climbing. Honestly, I appreciated the attention they were paying. Additionally, I noticed staff members constantly cleaning and tidying up, which gave me peace of mind about the cleanliness of the facility. After visiting other indoor play centers, I can confidently say this place surpasses them all.

An added bonus was the warm atmosphere created by other parents. Everyone seemed genuinely nice, and the kids quickly made friends. One child even helped my 2-year-old into the ball pit. It‚Äôs clear that this place fosters a great community.

If I had one suggestion, it would be to make the arcade games and cotton candy machine card-friendly. I would have easily bled $30-40 into those machines, but I rarely carry cash and didn‚Äôt notice an ATM on-site. A token system or card payments could be a great addition, but I understand the challenges with credit card fees for small businesses.

As for keeping an eye on your kids, you‚Äôll see a range of options. Some parents worked on laptops in centrally located tables, others relaxed on phones in cozy egg-shaped chairs or enjoyed massage chairs, while some simply found comfy spots to sit along the perimeter. I was more active since my youngest is a bit of a daredevil, but overall, it was a relaxing experience that properly exhausted my kids and provided a nice, quiet drive home.

I hope this review helps other parents considering the drive to Easley for a fun and engaging spot for their kids.

Review: This place is a safety hazard‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è In the 1-3 toddler section, there are metal poles sticking up from the ground that they wrapped in pool noodles(with the top exposed for a child to put their hand in). The foam mats are bulging (my child tripped over the bulge twice), and have gaps in between each other. The kitchen lights were off you couldn‚Äôt even tell it was open. When you walk in, you take your shoes off and head to the person at the desk. You write your child‚Äôs name down in their log book. There isn‚Äôt a sign displayed or an injury liability waiver you sign saying ‚Äúthe owners or operators of the playground are not legally liable for any injuries that occur while using the equipment‚Äù. Paying $9 for a potential trip to the hospital isn‚Äôt worth it to me. They play Caribbean music and nothing else. This is a kids place they should play kid friendly music.

Pro: Unlimited playtime for $9. The play areas were clean.

Review: This place is very unsafe. The mats around the trampolines are not tied down so small children can fall through. One of the trampolines even has a hole in it so a small child's foot can go through. When climbing up the hills to the big slides, the padding does not go from wall to wall. My friends 16 month son almost fell through the cracks which untimely ended our play time early there. Also a lot of the features on the attractions were broken or blocked off, my 12 year old was pretty upset about that. I will say for the most part they keep the place pretty clean, there is a person that walks round and makes sure toys are put back and organized and cleans up after each person sits at a table to eat. My 12 month daughter loves it of course so we'll be going back but under very close supervision because as I said, the place is very unsafe. 0 safety stars.

Review: This place is great as far as taking your kids to have fun. There‚Äôs a lot of space to run around and it‚Äôs nice not having to sit out in the heat. There are tables off to the side for people to sit & eat. The kids always enjoy running around here, & it‚Äôs only $11 per child, for unlimited time, so that‚Äôs an amazing price.

The only reason this place gets 3 out of 5 stars today is because my mom ordered food. She ordered a wings combo & 2 large fries on the side. The wings combo was made very quickly, but they forgot the 2 sides of fries. When I asked about them, they said they‚Äôd be ready soon. Maybe ten minutes later, I was told it‚Äôd be another 10 minutes‚Ä¶ It took them 40 minutes to begin making the fries & the lady‚Äôs reason was that she didn‚Äôt see it because the boy who took the order wrote it too small‚Ä¶. Absolutely ridiculous.

Then to top it off, I asked the boy at the front for more napkins at some point and he literally handed me ONE.

So, great place for the kids to play, but food service is definitely not their expertise.

Review: My husband and I booked this venue for our son‚Äôs first birthday party. However, 2 weeks before the event, we visited the venue just to orient ourselves with the area and facility. Upon arrival, we were mortified by the poor maintenance of the store front (view image). We booked the venue based on the images on the website (lesson learned). We had not seen the venue in person until this day. We continued to enter the building, but with hesitation. We were pleasantly surprised by the manager‚Äôs warm welcome and she gave us facility tour. The inside looks much better than the outside, but the party rooms are dated and needs work.
After the tour, we decided to go with another venue that is better maintained in Sandy Springs. The manager provided a refund of our deposit without hesitation.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this spot to anyone who prefers an aesthetically pleasing and modern feel, but I‚Äôd recommend for a random drop-in hour of play.

Review: I wish I could give 0 stars. Don't waste your time or money. The guy at the front desk tried to sell me dirty socks, the one area where my toddler can climb the safety net had holes and the plastic zipper was poking out. Some foam mats were not placed correctly and mats were lifted up which can cause anyone to trip
My main issue was I couldn't assist my 1yo on any equipment. All she could do was climb up the little bridge because she needed help to go down the slide. They have a sign that says 13yr or older cannot use equipment
So the little slides that are near the toddler area you have the audacity to have big kids there when the big kids already have at least 4 slides to choose from. The big kids are running all in the toddler area knocking down the blocks and being wild. The toddler area should be seperated better than this, it should be gated appropriately to protect the toddlers. The music was inappropriate and filthy. I do not recommend this place. Protect your kids and go to a safer place so they can truly enjoy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE.

Review: I used to love this place. Went yesterday & the customer service was terrible. Very much nonchalant personalities from the staff. I believe they are under new management or something because most of the staff seemed like the were related. They were also dressed in regular clothes so you couldn‚Äôt tell who actually worked there. The staff needs to do better with customer service because I did not feel welcomed as a customer at all. Overall, this is a decent place to to take your kids. The place could be a tad cleaner & organized but my main concern was the terrible customer service.

Review: I MUST rate them a 5! The staff is friendly and my grandson didn't want to leave after two hours. That's saying a LOT because it is monumentally difficult to hold his attention. The biggest draw for me is... THERE ARE NO VIDEO GAMES. The fact that he is now so interested in indoor play and making friends is a happy development. Children 4 to12 should love it here. The babies under three or four years need very close supervision  because the baby section is cordoned off in the middle of the floor, and the older children routinely jump over the dividers and run through.}","Georgia","kidslandga.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","30236"

Review: This place deserves the 5 stars but I can‚Äôt do it based on one person. There‚Äôs a girl that works there and she has to be some kind of manager or something because she wears purple instead of pink or the yellow I see everyone else wear. This girl is extremely rude to not only the kids but to the adults too. I watched her walking around yelling at the kids and then give the adults dirty looks like if she was waiting for them to say something. Walking away cursing under her breath. You can tell she doesn‚Äôt do well with kids so this job really isn‚Äôt for her.

All the good things are:
The rest of the staff is wonderful and seem to enjoy the kids. The girl who checked us in was super sweet and was interacting with my kids which I thought was really nice and personable. Not to mention she‚Äôs a heck of a saleswoman she convinced us to purchase a punchcard which would save us money. I like the time she took to explain everything to us. I like that they offer all day play so you get to leave to eat and come back with the receipt. My favorite part was that I got to go in and play with the kids. Most kid gyms don‚Äôt let the adults play so I really felt like a kid and had a blast with my kids. This place is super clean as well and you‚Äôll see the staff constantly cleaning which makes you feel at ease. Let‚Äôs you know your kids won‚Äôt get sick by just playing. I think the pricing is better than most parks or gyms. They don‚Äôt allow outside food but that‚Äôs okay because they sell snacks at a reasonable price. The same girl told us about snackpacks that give you a full kids meal and a free ride on the motorcycles they have for a good price. This place really is an awesome gym and we will be coming back all summer long.
Save yourself some money buying a punchcard !!
Thank you kids empire for making this summer one to look forward too

Before you go I HIGHLY recommend calling to see if there are any camps coming in. We were there today with multiple camps and it was absolutely horrible. There were not enough staff to ensure safety of all the kids. We will go again but not on a day when there are camp children.

Review: We visited Kids Empire yesterday and‚Ä¶ WOW. It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve been looking for since becoming a parent. Truly a kid‚Äôs dream and a parent‚Äôs dream! My daughter played for five straight hours‚Äîno exaggeration‚Äîand probably would‚Äôve kept going if we let her. There‚Äôs absolutely no shortage of things to do. It‚Äôs like old-school Chuck-E-Cheese on steroids but cleaner, safer, and way more exciting.

The setup is perfect for active kids to explore, climb, slide, and just be joyfully chaotic. As a parent, it was amazing to watch her run wild in a space built for her. I seriously wish they had a full membership option instead of just a punch card‚Äîbecause I‚Äôd be first in line without a second thought. Already planning our next visit!

Review: This center is the perfect place to let my little one unwind and burn off extra energy. I like that it‚Äôs sensory centered with less technology based activities.  I had a prior terrible experience, staff was terrible, but I decided to try it again. There must have been a change in management because this particular staff member was very attentive, I think his name is Anthony. He was so welcoming. It was surprisingly clean in spite of it being a children‚Äôs play gym. This will definitely be a place I return to often not that there seems to be shift in the atmosphere.

Review: My honest review
Not worth the money. ($22 per child end everyone has to have socks even adults who don‚Äôt plan to play $3 for socks..I paid $31 for one child and two pair of socks)

Online it seems like a lot of attractions but once there they only have a jungle gym and a small area to play with a ball (soccer). They have cars to drive around but it‚Äôs for small kids. My child is 9‚Ä¶.doesn‚Äôt care for that. I feel like it may be fun for children 6 and younger.

I didn‚Äôt like that we had to put our shoes in bins and had to carry the bins everywhere we went or put by our table if no more cubbies were available.

The seating is too close together. It‚Äôs no space at all.

The food is a bunch of snacks you can but from the corner store or bring in yourself but they don‚Äôt allow you to. They have fruit snacks, chips, pudding, Oreo cookies etc and juice and soda. In their $7 snack pack you get a pb&j sandwich with a choice of two other snacks and a drink. Not worth it.

I honestly will not bring my child back until they have specials. It should be $15 socks included.

I only have 3 stars because it‚Äôs clean and staff was friendly to me but I did see them rolling their eyes at a few people

My family and I set up my daughters entire party which that part was fine we didn‚Äôt mind doing that but we did basically host our own party other than going to get the things we did not have access to. I spoke with the regional manager a few days prior to my daughter‚Äôs party he assured me that they would have everything correct. I purchased additional play cards for each child in attendance and was not told until the party they had to put all of the flames on one card so i basically would have had to follow behind the children throughout the party to swipe the one card to be shared between 19 children. When i expressed that needed to be fixed i was told my party had to be paid in full. I paid with no issues which i told them was not a good idea in case they had to charge me extra for something or not charge me for a child not showing up or anything. But i paid as requested. They could not fix the issue with the play cards and my daughters party was coming to an end. I asked for a refund for the play cards and was told I had to wait 7-10 days to receive my money back when they could have just waited to fix the issue and adjusted my balance accordingly as I have had done at other places. There weren‚Äôt enough tables to accommodate my party size and we had to wait for another party to finish before we could get the extra table. When i tried to reach back out to express the concerns I had at my daughters party no one will respond to me now because they already got paid so I guess the urgency to call me back is non existent. On a positive note the staff was very friendly they really did try to help with the issues it‚Äôs just that the issue was not fixable by them so it was out of their hands. Jemya Kam Trey (i believe that‚Äôs his name) and Regina were all super nice and they really tried their best. There was also a female manager there that was also very nice and tried her best to accommodate. I will never have a party here again. It‚Äôs a great place for a play date but parties especially Saturday no way will never happen again.

Review: Today, we had the pleasure of bringing a group of students to Kids Empire to celebrate our Class of 2025 Kindergarten and VPK graduation. From the moment we arrived, the exceptional hospitality provided by Mya, Rayuan, and Lakay stood out, making our experience truly special.

The children had an amazing time exploring, playing, and celebrating together. The facility was spotless, and the entire staff was welcoming and attentive, ensuring our group felt valued and cared for.

Our students at RTSA are already looking forward to their next visit, and we can‚Äôt wait to return soon!

Sincerely,
Mrs. Mitchell, Center Director

Review: Update: Still clean, still amazing, the staff are still incredible. This time we were there for a birthday party. Pizza and cake were good, but due to their policies they can not provide any utensils except a spoon.

Super fun for literally everyone. My 2 year old loved everything. The employees are fantastic! We didn't try the claw machines or the ""go cart"". We probably will next time because my son was interested. The price is more than fair for entry. Everything is clean and organized.
The bathroom was clean too. The drinks and snacks available are adult and kid favorites. Credit card only, no AMEX. Parking lot still needs some TLC. We are thrilled with Kids Empire. This is what Jacksonville needs!

Review: Great concept of a place, but having a birthday party here was not worth the price. Customer service was terrible from the confirmation call, all the way through the actual party.

There was no direction when it came to the check in process. No special line for birthday parties or any signs or anything. The staff were rude until I mentioned I was hosting a birthday party there, then all of a sudden her tone changed.

Party pricing makes no sense. It would have been cheaper to just pay admission for all the kids at $22 each, adults are free with their kids, and then buy them each a lunch set at $7, which also includes a game card. Instead, if you book a party you have to pay for ALL the adults AND infants (which are also normally free). And THEN you pay an upcharge for them to bring you Pizza Hut pizza, which was way late for us, everyone was starving and cranky by the time it showed up. We had 15 kids, which would have been $435 with normal admittance and food costs. Instead they wanted to charge us over $700 for the same people, only difference is there was pizza, drinks, and cake. You‚Äôre not allowed to bring outside food in, but their food is from outside sources. They don‚Äôt even have private party rooms, your tables are in the middle of everyone else so people are walking through your ‚Äúparty‚Äù the entire time you‚Äôre there. The party host doesn‚Äôt really do anything, we served our own food and drinks, cut the cake, lit the candles, etc. She came around every so often to pick up trash but that was really it. Chuck E. Cheese does a better birthday party than this place!

On top of all of that, this place was so crowded, and there were NO staff in the play area to supervise or anything. We noticed so many safety hazards. The kids all had fun but none of the parents were impressed by this place. Very disappointing.

Review: The facilities are great for kids, but their waiver policy for adults is nonsensical, inappropriate, and invasive. I say this as an attorney with 16+ years of experience.

Kids Empire Jacksonville forces every adult, to include 82 year old grandparents, to submit personal emails (assuming they have one), phone numbers, and addresses, and sign a waiver (e.g. contract of adhesion) in order to SIT at a table and watch their grandchildren play.  These requirements for clearly non-participants is legally unnecessary, an invasion of privacy, and likely a stealthy money grab for personally identifying information which will no doubt be sold to a data broker as soon as granny exits the facility.

The point of a legitimate waiver is to guard against liability and potential personal injury suits. The policy of Kids Empire Jacksonville goes far beyond this rational purpose and seems to suit more nefarious purposes. I strongly recommend you reconsider visiting this facility and visit the Bravos Entertainment Center--a trampoline park near Bartam Park--who had a far more reasonable, legally permissible policy.

Review: Worst first experience. We decided to take my 1 year old for the first time. The check in process took forever and they didn‚Äôt explain anything to us as a first time guest. They were very short staffed and people kept interrupting our check in process. Since it was a Saturday evening I knew it was going to be crowded but the toddler area wasn‚Äôt too bad. However there were a lot of big kids in that section. I believe it is only meant for kids in diapers. So I worried about my one year old getting trampled on. There was a lot of no supervision from parents and because the workers were so short staffed they were not enforcing the rules. My toddler loved the ball pit and had a wonderful time. But there was an unsupervised child that kept coming up to him and wanting to hug and smother him in kisses. Now I already know this place is covered in germs. It‚Äôs expected but I don‚Äôt want an unknown child smothering my baby with kisses. I had to literally pull him off. We left right after that. It was horrendous and scary.

Review: I really enjoyed taking my daughter there for her 1st birthday but I want to add that sick kids should not be allowed in the park. I noticed a sick kid in the toddler area (clear signs of green discharge and sneezing) but it was already late to take my daughter to come closer to her. My daughter has been sick since then and we all got sick as well! I would also point the importance of cleaning the toddler areas as I noticed which appeared to be vomit in some areas. Again - please, don‚Äôt let sick kids in or make parents sign something confirming the kid is not ill. We have been struggling with our daughter sickness for days and she hasn‚Äôt recovered! Other than that, great place but I would avoid bringing the youngest kids. Parents IF your kid is SICK PLEASE be home for the safety of other kids!

From start to finish, everything was seamless, thoughtful, and beautifully executed. Audrey went above and beyond with the d√©cor‚Äîevery single detail matched our Wonderland theme perfectly. From the balloons and backdrops to the table runners and themed play areas, it truly felt like stepping into a storybook. Even our guests (yes, including the dads!) were commenting on how detailed and magical everything was!

The space was clean, safe, and full of fun‚Äîfrom a ball pit and obstacle course to interactive play stations and an inflatable bounce area. It was a dream setup that let the kids play freely while the adults relaxed and enjoyed the party. All we had to do was show up and set out the food‚Äîeverything else was handled with care and creativity.

I cannot recommend Romp-a-Roo enough for your next party or celebration. It‚Äôs rare to find a venue that feels this personal, welcoming, and well-curated. Thank you, Audrey, for making Chloe‚Äôs ONEderland celebration so incredibly special‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to return!

I viewed items and areas being cleaned throughout our time there and I love that there are 3-4 bathrooms (that I‚Äôve counted) on sight. Although the virtual experience with the sandbox was not available, my son still enjoyed himself playing in the sand. There was even a painting opportunity for the kids. Overall this is the place to go for a quality experience for your kids.

Review: In response to Curt Digla & Nordrissa Lewis:
I completely disagree with this review, as my experiences at this venue have always and consistently been the complete opposite. It‚Äôs clear that the reviewer had a frustrating visit, but many of their complaints seem exaggerated or based on misunderstandings.
First, calling this place a ""glorified daycare"" is unfair. It‚Äôs an indoor entertainment space designed for kids to have fun in a safe and engaging environment. The bounce houses, attractions, and activities are exactly what one would expect from a family-friendly venue.
It makes perfect business sense for certain attractions to be available only on specific days to encourage visits during slower periods (i.e. Wednesday)‚Äîthis is a common business strategy, not an attempt to deceive customers.
Regarding pricing, hosting a party at any entertainment venue comes with costs, and $416 for a birthday party that includes a dedicated space, play areas, and food is actually quite reasonable compared to similar venues. Pizza and Capri Suns are standard party offerings, and expecting gourmet options at this price point is unrealistic.
As for the cake, I don‚Äôt know of a single venue that includes cakes as part of the package‚Äîoutside cakes are clearly allowed, so all it takes is asking. However, last-minute issues can happen anywhere, and instead of escalating frustration, a simple check with staff could have clarified the situation.
The owners and their family members are PHENOMENAL, and their staff is professional. If a child was asked to remove a wristband, I have no doubt it was handled appropriately. The accusation of racial favoritism is not only unfair but also unfounded‚ÄîTHIS BUSINESS DOES NOT OPERATE ON RACIAL BIAS.
Additionally, the claim that the venue fabricates positive reviews is simply false.
Comparing this experience to renting a bounce house at home completely ignores the fact that not everyone has the space, time, or desire to host a party themselves. Many parents appreciate the convenience of an all-in-one venue where they don‚Äôt have to worry about setup, cleanup, or keeping kids entertained.
This review is overly negative and fails to recognize the value this venue provides. My personal experience, as well as that of many others, has been overwhelmingly positive.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VENUE TO PARENTS‚ÄîIT IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST, FRIENDLIEST INDOOR PLAY AREAS WE HAVE EVER TAKEN OUR LITTLE ONE TO. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Review: I was here yesterday at my cousins 2nd birthday party and I had a bad experience I completely agree with Niva and Curt, when having a child micromanaging other kids and snatching their wristband off is very unprofessional not only that the male owner comes to a party to try and check someone about a bad review is unprofessional and unreal. The prices are too high for it to be a daycare center with 2 bouncy houses. 30$ to do nothing is insane. Then for you to use the same paint brushes for each child face like Covid and other things not going around is crazy. I rate this place a 0/10 I will never send my worst enemy there.

The building accommodates the amount of bounce houses that it can according to its size, no false advertising at all. If someone is looking for more they could have simply driven an hour away to find one. No need to tear down an awesome business. It‚Äôs clean on the inside and many staff around to keep it that way and to offer any help.

From the planning for the event, to the actual party, the staff were on point. The atmosphere was great, the place was clean, and there was more than enough activities to keep about twenty 6-7 year olds entertained. The kids and adults had a wonderful time thanks to the staff‚Äôs amazing dedication. I highly recommend this place.

Review: We came here as part of a birthday party and had a nice time! We were greeted warmly, and the facility was immaculately clean which started things off perfectly. They have a couple different bounce houses, an infant/small toddler area, an obstacle course, and two different sensory rooms. This would be an excellent rainy day spot to take a family, especially if you have infants and school-aged kiddos.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a five star review is because the venue itself isn‚Äôt great at noise dampening and with the motors from the inflatables, it‚Äôs very loud even before there are kids running and playing. Overall, if we lived closer we‚Äôd absolutely be frequenting here!

Review: I can‚Äôt rave about Eve‚Äôs Garden enough!!! I took my daughter to this establishment for the very first time, and she had an absolute blast!!! I was extremely impressed and pleased when I called in and spoke with the owner. Her name is Scherika (I‚Äôll come back and confirm if I spelled her name correctly). She was so nice, pleasant, down to earth and professional all at once. When we arrived, my child was the only guest there, but the owner assured me that she would have someone to play with in no time, as her children were just finishing their studies. We received a first visit discount, but even without the discount, it‚Äôs still very reasonably priced. She and her children were so sweet and attentive to my daughter. She also has massage chairs for the parents (better than the nail salon pedicure chairs). She noticed that my daughter was tugging on my hand, but I had just sat down and began the massage, so she came and got my baby, took her by the hand, and led her to yet another one of the many activities that they have to offer, so that I could finish my massage‚Ä¶ THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for that!!! I‚Äôm also happy that no shoes are allowed, so that keeps dirty shoes germs at bay. All in all, a wonderful experience!!! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back in a couple of days!!!

Review: I was searching for an indoor playroom in my area to take my nearly 20-month-old granddaughter and found Eve's Garden at the last minute when I had almost given up. I wasn't in the mood for the chaos of a trampoline park, but with the extreme heat, I knew we wanted to be indoors. From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by the safe, clean and fun environment. My granddaughter had an absolute blast, and to my surprise, my 11-year-old son enjoyed himself as well. They had air hockey, basketball, jumbo connect 4, an inflatable obstacle course, an interactive sand room and an interactive ball game room with a projector for him.

The variety of activities available kept both children entertained and busy. It took my granddaughter a little while to acclimate, but in no time, she was running around, laughing and playing! For this outing, I was specifically looking for a toddler-friendly space, ensuring she could have fun without the risk of being trampled by bigger kids. Eve's Garden perfectly fit the bill, and it was an added bonus that my son also had a great time. The music was amazing, and although we didn't partake because we had just eaten, I saw that they had a variety of snacks and drinks for purchase.

I've already recommended Eve's Garden to a dozen friends and family and can't wait to visit again when my granddaughter is back in town. The experience, staff, cleanliness and overall atmosphere were all top-notch. 10 out of 10!

She actually tried an inflatable before we left and liked it.  My son loved EVERYTHING, from the inflatables to the ball wall, to the sand table, to the air hockey to basketball...like I said EVERYTHING!

My six year old had a meltdown, unlike one I had ever seen when it was time to leave. The owner helped me, made me not feel judged, and even whispered a quick prayer for my patience. I don't think she really understands how much I needed and value that! This place is really a gem!!!!

Review: We had our daughter‚Äôs second birthday party here the other weekend and it went so amazing. Everyone was so helpful, kind and eager to assist or make things easier for us. I really couldn‚Äôt say enough great things about the establishment and the family who runs it.
The thing that drew me in to this facility is how it is someplace safer and more aimed to the younger kids. Taking my toddler to a big name jump place is absolutely out of the question. They‚Äôd get trampled before getting completely through the door. At Eve‚Äôs garden, I know she‚Äôs able to run and jump and play- just living her best life and I don‚Äôt have to be in constant fear she‚Äôs going to get ran over by a big kid.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they have things aimed for the older kids, it‚Äôs not just for toddlers. My 8 year old daughter and 9 year old niece had a blast there as well! There‚Äôs a really cool obstacle course kinda thing that they had a great time with. There‚Äôs an interactive sand table that‚Äôs one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen for kids in a long time. Ok maybe not just for kids cause I did play with it too lol and there‚Äôs an air hockey table that took me back to my childhood daycare days.
Overall, this place is great. The staff is great. The environment is great. We will definitely be back to Eve‚Äôs garden indoor playground!!!
Thank you all again so much for helping us with our party. Top tier. 10/10 very much recommend!!!

Review: My husband and I heard about this place on Facebook and had to check it out for our 8 month old baby girl. Coffee and food was amazing. We loved the different sections of play/learn areas. Our little girl had fun and we saw improvement on just our first visit! For example the tall play cubes in the corner she actually used to pull herself up to play with, and she had never done that before! They have high chairs around which came in handy when it was time to feed her lunch. Overall good experience! We‚Äôve been meaning to get back in but the baby has been sick. Will be stopping in again soon!

I can honestly say that the current owners are so genuine and love this place. It‚Äôs always so clean, and taken care of. This is truly one of the best things for the community and surrounding communities as well, as it provides a clean, and safe, environment for most literally all ages!

Review: The Play Factory Caf√© is a total gem for families in Jacksonville. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and comfortable. It‚Äôs clean, well-organized, and thoughtfully designed for both kids and parents to enjoy.

The play area is safe, fun, and full of activities that keep little ones busy for hours. My kids had an amazing time exploring all the different play zones while I got to relax with a delicious coffee and some peace of mind knowing they were safe and entertained.

The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the caf√© offers great snacks and drinks‚Äînot just for kids but for adults too (a huge bonus). It‚Äôs clear they care about creating a great experience for families.

Highly recommend The Play Factory Caf√© to any parent looking for a fun, clean, and cozy indoor play spot!

Review: I've got 2 kids under 4 and let me tell you this place is an absolute gem!!!
There is plenty for the kids to do without being overwhelming. It's adorable! The snack menu is perfect! And very reasonably priced. My daughter played on her own here for three hours today completely enthralled.

But momma's, the bathroom is where the true thoughtfulness shines through.
There's a REAL CHANGING TABLE in there! SUPERB!  And for those of you mid potty training, there's a potty seat adapter on the wall, and the kind that's attached, and flips down. And a little stool so the kids can wash their hands. And anyone with a sensory issue, it's a quiet bathroom.

All of the toys are sturdy, clean, with a ton of open ended play opportunities. Anyone who is on the fence about a Loverly toy subscription, they have a bunch of those toys too! Start to finish, this place was incredibly well thought out and we are excited to go again soon!
Fun for the kids, easy on the parents!

Remember your Socks! And have a great time!

Review: From the moment we walked in, my boys (3 year old and 1 year old) were fully immersed in a play world thoughtfully tailored for young, developing minds. My youngest was fully engrossed in the Montessori-style toys in a section on one end of the play area, while my oldest was often happily shopping or exploring in the market; they converged in the playground and enjoyed climbing and sliding. The entire place was clean and safely designed with children in mind, from the sanitation bins in the play area to the toddler-sized toilet seats. I highly recommend Play Factory and Caf√©! The owner also greeted us warmly and was fully devoted to maintaining a fun, safe, and sanitary environment.

Review: This is a fantastic spot! The setup is perfect for moms/dads who want to get a coffee and chat, read, or work on various things while their children can play in a safe, engaging, and fun space out of the heat! I love the visibility factor. I can sit at any of the tables around the play space and still see most, if not all of the area to keep an eye on my older toddlers. The infant area is set apart, but still within the main play space so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about baby being trampled, but can still see and engage with an older sibling while you play with the youngest.

I also appreciate the kid friendly lunch options (like a grilled cheese!) when I‚Äôve neglected to pack lunch.

We‚Äôve done a 2yr old birthday party here and it was such a fun experience for everyone involved and the owners are super nice and helpful.

They‚Äôve been adding a lot of small events and we were finally able to come to an Easter one and my children had SO much fun! The owners were engaging and have fantastic personalities for running a children‚Äôs play space like this. The number of children at the sold out event was just right and I look forward to attending more in the future.

From books, puzzles and bikes to a playground, train set or supermarket - they enjoyed it all. Everything was super clean and it was nonstop fun for my kids.

The party room was perfectly sized, everything we needed and could have wanted was there, and then some. I truly cannot say enough good things about this place.

It is so nice to have a place to relax while you watch your kids, catch up on emails, return calls and just get caught up on things in the AC. It is one of the few places my toddler and young child will use the bathroom at. Very clean. Very friendly staff. Socks are required.

The concept is great and I was so excited to try an indoor play space during a hot summer day but it was honestly a letdown. There were very few toys to play with (except in the ‚Äúinfant‚Äù area), there‚Äôs one large climbing apparatus with 2 slides (one of which catapults the children onto the floor), and the group of kids that were there seemed to be friends of the owner and were kind of running the space. $16 was very steep for what is offered and there are free options around town that are way more entertaining. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be back, unfortunately.

Review: It's unethical knowing that these new owners  have continued to sit back and inherit these amazing google reviews KNOWING that they are from the previous owners.
We have come here for YEARS, and now the place has been tainted with helicopter moms. None of the kids were ""bad"" at all, but if a child picks up a foam block more than 6 inches they will warn you and the kid. Even if it's a 1 year old.
The anxiety that these people give you makes the whole point of coming null and void.
We have 4 other sets of friends who too have stopped going because of the new owners.
It's a very small place and everyone polices their own kids, there is no need to go out of your way and talk to the children over absolutely minor issues.
I pity the owners kids!

Review: I love taking my son here. It's a great, small indoor play space for children 5 and under that also has a game room for older kids. The owners and staff are extremely friendly and always make us feel welcome and treat us like family. The ever expanding menu is a great touch as well as having themed events randomly. We spend hours here every time we go. My son has a blast with all of the open-ended toys. His creativity skyrockets.

This establishment revolutionizes parties for our beloved little ones, while also remembering to include parents/family members in the fun. The space is wide open for exploration, and includes all of the latest and greatest gadgets and gizmos for kids to play with, and just when you thought only the tots were going to enjoy themselves, comes a digital oasis, also known as the Game Room. We had an absolute blast, and will most likely be hosting her 2nd, and many subsequent birthdays here. Glad to have found such an incredible gem to host this momentous occasion at an awesome price given all the accommodations the wonderful host provided.

They have a wonderful variety of drinks, coffees, snacks, etc. Tons of arcade games, and lots to keep kids occupied and burn energy. My daughter loves the playground, ninja course, foam pit, ball pits, and the trampolines. I even enjoy my time in this place. I love how they lock the doors at the front. Kids can't get outside without a parent. Melissa is the manager and my daughter loves her! She makes sure you feel safe at all times. This place is clean and fun! Best kid indoor park around.

Review: I like to start all reviews with a positive. Our 11 y/o daughter did have a good time since this was her birthday weekend surprise. My youngest daughter is 3 and she enjoyed the kids area and running around. They do have a nice kids area that‚Äôs intended for younger kids to allow them a safe place apart from older kids. For the negative, when we arrived my wife asked if we could purchase a pizza(s) and she was told they only had one left so she asked if we could order a pizza to bring in since they were out.. she was told no.. I went up to speak with the manager and while I waited in line I listened to the young girl at the register talking trash about my wife asking if we could bring a pizza in since they were out‚Ä¶. I walked away‚Ä¶ about 10 minutes later they all of a sudden had 12 pizzas- so we purchased 6 for our group of 6 ppl along with 7 drinks total (over 75$ spent)- No problem.. then my wife‚Äôs mom stopped by to wish our daughter a happy bday and brought in some cupcakes, which we were quickly told were not allowed to eat inside. But they were nice enough and stored it in the back fridge so it wouldn‚Äôt melt. All this to say, if you don‚Äôt pay the 200$ for a party, don‚Äôt take any food or drinks‚Ä¶and if they are out of food,  whatever you do, don‚Äôt ask if you can bring anything in‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably get talked about like your a criminal‚Ä¶ total of 150$ spent here.

First time having a party here, the party host said she was our party host but never was there. Didn‚Äôt help any and then disappeared . The party room itself was just a few table clothes plates napkins and cups and silver ware . Ants all over the counter top couldn‚Äôt put any of our stuff there as ants would cover it all.

Then wanted to get a coffee but lady at the register was eating chips and then she didn‚Äôt wash hands and was going to fix coffee I said nope no way. I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm super clean I can‚Äôt let someone fix a coffee for me without cleaning their fingers from eating!

Then I feel like it under new ownership because they took out the new shops stores and only left the ones on the wall to give it a more open look, took away basketball hoops in jumping area trampolines and also they added more fun to ninja course, which makes me think new ownership took over . They put new stuff in baby section and opened the floor up more and spreaded out seating!

Would I do another party there ? No . It was ok just my son said he hated it and wasn‚Äôt happy

That broke my heart and I paid over 287 dollars spent

Never celebrate your child's birthday because he won't have fun, he's super boring and the worst to choose from.

If you have an issue, she will handle it. Kids run through energy and it is always nice and cool inside. They have ball pits, trampolines, food, coffee, playing stations for kids to play in, slides, jungle gym, acrade and games to play, massage chairs, clean bathrooms, a foam pit where you can climb a wall, massage chairs, plenty of seating, and much more. I love that they have a door system that locks so the kids can't run out of the establishment. It makes you feel safe. One of our favorite places in Salisbury!

Review: I don't normally write reviews but I'm going to this time because of Karen's running the place down. I have took my 14 month old twice and this past weekend went with my nieces, nephews, stepdaughter, and my daughter. Ages (2) 17, 14, 13, 10, and 14 months. Got into a debate on facebook about the cleanliness of this place. All of the kids have had a blast both times I went. I see nothing wrong with the cleanliness of this place. People on Facebook were downing this place and saying the one in mooresville was cleaner, I can't comment on the one in mooresville as I've never been there. But from what I have gathered the fun factory cleans just as much as that one does. My thoughts are that the fun factory is in a older building and it's not in mooresville where a bunch of rich Karen's live. Therefore Karen's want to put this place down. We have not gotten sick either time from going here and see nothing wrong with it. My only complaint would be the older kids going into the toddler section. I would like to see this place stay for years to come where I have somewhere to take my 14 month old to play, but if everyone keeps it up they may go under for no reason other than it's not new and fancy enough for the local white SUV Starbucks drinking Karen's.

The foam cubes in the trampoline area and the ninja course are torn up pretty bad and look a bit dirty. The lighting in 2 of the play rooms are very dim, along with the playground area, a few corners are dark and my daughter was too scared to go in there.
They had fun but I would love to see some updating in the mentioned areas.

Review: I think this place is probably really great for older kids. The ‚Äútoddler area‚Äù gets easily overrun with older kids who just want to play in the ball pit and pay no attention to the younger kids that are in there. I think 1-5 is probably a bit broad to be called a toddler area. I had to stay on top of my son to make sure he didn‚Äôt get trampled by the older kids who would basically push him out of the way to get in front of him. I think capacity limits would be good on weekends as well, especially with birthday parties. Like I said I think older kids would love it, but if you‚Äôre going to market a toddler area for the younger kids make it an actual area where only toddlers are.

Review: This place used to be so good! We loved coming here often, but it's been about 6 months since our last visit. Came today to find most of the foam blocks destroyed and ripped, no toys in the play areas (puppet theater-no puppets; vet center- 2 over sized animals that kids can't even pick up and no doctor equipment; ice cream stand with no ice cream, no scoopers, nothing; they're also extremely dark with no overhead lighting for that area). Anything that's meant to be touched like the games, balls, etc are sticky and filthy with grime. Such a shame, I feel like the upkeep of this place is slipping. Even the mats that should be easy to clean around the slides are absolutely filthy. This spot doesn't seem as sanitary as it once was, leaving a lot of room for concern about taking young children here.

Sad !! My 2 year old niece grab the railing and it popped off exposing super long staples she almost got cut we told staff all they did was put it back on and put two nails in it. Honestly sad how they don‚Äôt fix anything properly it looks horrible! They don‚Äôt even have anything to play with in the market area but a doll house and ripped up clothes that are dirty I didn‚Äôt let my kid touch any of the clothes when I seen the state of it. Then I‚Äôm another room they have a vet station with tow stuffed animals that are sooo dirty. Reminds me of 5 goodwills toys. Honestly save yourself the money because they are also always crowded due to birth day parties and every review is spot on they don‚Äôt tell the older kids to follow rules my kids are 5 and 7 an got pushed around and treated like crap by mean older kids. Take you‚Äôre business elsewhere maybe one day they will take the money from the crowded birth days and fix their business up

Review: We visited The Fun Factory today with our son who just recently turned FOUR and the space is perfect for that age group. It wasn't busy and he was able to run around and explore. He loves ducks and they had a duck game, I spent $5 and was unable to win him one and of course he didn't like that. I asked the young lady working if I could just purchase a duck and she responded she would ask the owner. A few minutes later a young man who worked there said he had an owners card that would allow him to play the game and try to win my son a duck. After about 5 or so tries he finally won him one and my son was so excited. I realize they didn't have to do that, but I greatly appreciate that they did. It is those small acts of kindness that can make a kids day. We will be back üòä

But order you an iced latte bc this  vanilla iced latte touched my soul how good it was. The coffee game is strong with this place. I might come by an just order a coffee. We will be back.

Review: It wasn‚Äôt horrible but it wasn‚Äôt great either. This was the second time I‚Äôve been here and I was holding off on a review just in case we had a different experience the next time. The tiny house section is a cute idea but not maintained at all. The toys are mostly broken or missing or dirty. It‚Äôs not really that safe for younger kids because the rules are not enforced. There are unsupervised older kids running and pushing and climbing up slides jumping on trampolines that have toddlers on them and no parents to be seen. The kids had fun but I was stressed the whole time.

Review: I‚Äôm adding three stars because a nice gentleman did apologize for our experience and gave them free passes for another visit BUT‚Ä¶.this smart mouthed little lady at the front checking us in‚Ä¶.all I can say is keep her in the BACK of the house. She had the nerve to question my son and his cousins age. As if they were lying about how old they are. She said it very nasty too. Then she decided she would half way help me sign the waiver and half way speak or assist me. Didn‚Äôt even tell me I needed to scan the QR code. But began helping a woman behind me fill out the waiver and explained it to her step by step. I said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to her twice within a few minutes. She didn‚Äôt respond to either. I‚Äôve brought my son here a couple times because he loves it here. But I promise miss thing in the front with the enough attitude for everyone in Rowan County‚Ä¶.move her elsewhere!

Review: Really wanted to like this place - it's decorated really cute and has lots of fun things for kids to do. However, they do not supervise the toddler area so if you have a baby trying to play, good luck! Bigger kids were jumping around and throwing things in the toddler area and when we asked the staff to help out, they didn't do anything. There also should be a limit for how many people can enter. It was so crowded when we got in that the kids couldn't even enjoy themselves. Save yourself 50$ and just go to the park across the street.

Review: Anyone who says that this is a very clean place has not actually went through the play areas. The area under the slide has so much dust and dirt that there are literal piles of dirt under the slides. With that being said, the area under the slide is not accessible to the children, just poses a health risk (dust is a breeding ground for mold).  Giving 4 stars anyways because my 13 month old still had a blast and i didn‚Äôt expect an indoor playground to be too clean lol
This was the most inexpensive place in the area and the staff were very friendly.

Review: This was my first and last time visiting the fun factory! I do not EVER recommend anyone purchasing tickets any ‚Äúspecial‚Äù event‚Ä¶ this place is pure chaos. I purchased tickets for the Elsa Ball to take my 4 year old. Upon arriving, the manager put a green wristband on my daughter‚Äôs wrist and explained there were not enough seats for parents and the seats were for the children attending the event which was perfectly fine! As soon as we get in there are parents sitting in every seat. This event was on a time schedule and when it came time for them to ‚Äúsit down and have a special snack‚Äù that was a complete joke. I asked the gentleman SEVERAL TIMES if my daughter could have a plate with a snack and she never received it, she had nowhere to sit because management couldn‚Äôt tell parents to get out of the chairs designated for the children. I saw the gentleman hand multiple kids snacks that weren‚Äôt even there for the event. Disappointed is an understatement. The majority of parents were complaining because it was so unprofessional, unorganized, rude, & flat out a waste of time and money. 0/10 recommend this place of business.

Review: If I could leave 0 I would. We came for Elsa that we paid for and it was terrible. Absolutely no organization whatsoever. It was so crowded my daughter kept getting knocked over. Had 3 birthday parties going on as well. No supervision over anyone just letting kids run all over everyone. It was our first time and will be our last. We drove 30 minutes for a complete disappointment. The entire building got to come up push other kids who were there for Elsa. I don‚Äôt know who your manager is but she was absolutely no help at all. She looked like a deer in headlights, no professionalism didn‚Äôt take accountability for anything. We paid to be there for a cracker and a piece of warm cheese. Spent more time waiting for a teenager to paint my kids face w some glitter then anything else. If I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for my kid to even get a cupcake she wouldn‚Äôt have. Never will I be back again. I want a refund and everyone else who came deserves a refund as well.

Review: Elsa's winter ball was an absolute disaster. Why would you schedule a special event along with a full house of birthday parties too. It was super crowded, the ""reserved"" seats for the children that paid for Elsa were taken by the parents, so when the 2 crackers and 2 pieces of cheese were passed around, only a handful of kids got that special treat. Face painting started at 6 by 1 painter, yes 1 for that huge crowd, but so did Olaf's special appearance. So which line do you choose?? We stayed in the face painting line and then Elsa appears.  We missed that too because every kid in the buidling jumped in front even if they were not there for the Elsa ball. There was no organization and nobody making sure that the kids signed up for the ball were getting to participate. We asked the ""manager"" many times to help us understand this chaos but she was clueless. The only thing that we got from this event was a picture with Elsa as she was ready to leave and the kids were starting to clear our. Y'all need to refund that money or get a new event planner because there were some pissed off moms in there.

Review: I regularly come here during the week with my almost 2 year old. Today was the first time I came on a Saturday. It. Was. Awful. They take reservations on Saturday and Sunday to keep the crowd at a minimum (or so they say), but this place was a madhouse from the second I stepped in. Because all age groups of children are welcome here, there were teenagers and rambunctious pre-teens everywhere. Some of them were lifting up the panels at the top of the stairs in the playground creating a fall hazard. Others were underneath making barriers where other children couldn't pass. It was also impossible to let my daughter play on the trampoline part because of so many unattended children being wild. It was also difficult to keep up with my daughter because there were so many people standing around. I had told my sister about this place and she was there too with her 7 month old and two older children. I was honestly embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I left quickly because it wasn't worth putting my small child in danger due to overcrowding and unsupervised children. I will continue to come here on weekdays, but if you have any kid under 7 or 8 years of age, do yourself a favor and skip it on the weekends.

Review: To many unnecessary negatives in reviews‚Ä¶What you see is what you get in their pictures‚Ä¶Staff is great and this place is the cleanest indoor playground I‚Äôve ever been in, they are ALWAYS cleaning‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs one place where you can take your child and NOT worry about those commercial places with ignorant kids and parents

Place is priced perfect‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the biggest but it‚Äôs not for older kids‚Ä¶The place is geared for ages 2-8 in my opinion, anyone older than that can get overwhelming. It‚Äôs injury proof for the most part to where my 3 year old roams around without a worry‚Ä¶

The food area is basic, they have basic snacks and drinks  and I haven‚Äôt seen them stop anyone for bringing in their own lunchbox for their child‚Ä¶

It feels like they add to it every single time go in and I go in atleast 2-3 times a month if not more‚Ä¶they theme decorate all the time which makes it fun and they have private party rooms

Review: Front desk was nice. Maybe it‚Äôs because we are from out of town and use to cleaner facilities.  The mega air park which is half of the facility, has massive 10-18‚Äù holes all throughout it. My son counted 5. The air pressure was so low he couldn‚Äôt bounce, he just sank into the platforms like a deflating air mattress. One child fell off a slide when she leaned on a side wall, another child who I think was around 4 jumped and her foot fell into one of the holes and landed on the ground.  My son also tried to run across the inflatable bridge but when he fell off all the ‚Äúbolsters‚Äù meant to catch him were to low and he hurt his arm when he landed. After this we left. Several party rooms are crammed full of building and cleaning supplies but the doors are wedged opened. I saw 1 toddler eyeing a mop bucket she spotted in there before her dad whisked her away.  The deflating air mattress was not only zero fun, but with massive holes and exposed chords it was a safety issue too. Luckily it was so bad no kids spent more than 2-3 minutes on it before they realized no area was fun.  I did bring it to the attention of the attendant who told the manager, he or she never addressed it and allegedly said they were ‚Äúout of tape‚Äù (duct tape is also covering many other wholes that aren‚Äôt ripped opened on the Max Air area.  The back of house employee were on their phones one was even sitting up high in his chair almost asleep. Not worth the $35 for a parent and kid to jump for an hour for sure.

***update
My previous post is from a year ago and today we come in and for what we would pay for two hours now cost $23 for one hour but there‚Äôs only half the park to play in because they have been remodeling it for about a month now. We brought our own socks and the cashier said we were charged for socks and then she said no we were not charged for socks but for an hour of park time so pretty much she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about because I just wondered why prices were so much higher when there‚Äôs only half a park available. I think the girl only cared about avoiding my question so therefore she could not answer it which makes me miss the old staff. also there should be a dress code because if I have to see one more little girls butt cheeks in my face hanging out of her shorts I‚Äôm telling you what.
We used to love this place and were once members but memberships are also not available currently so it‚Äôs just not what it used to be.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be back to the shop park since there‚Äôs another one on Commons Road.

If you go don‚Äôt buy or let your kids play the games. Even if they win tickets the prizes are pathetic Let them jump, but don‚Äôt waste your money. There are also no refreshments.

While there are a lot so safety pads and things everywhere; there are some areas of concern.  Some spots where the mats are separated and a kid could cut right through to the floor below.  Just watch your kids well, these spots were tucked back into corners that were hard to see.  Other then that my child had a great time.  He played on everything there and had a blast.

I literally got on it to help them and I sunk down to the floor bc the air was escaping through all the holes.

Review: Took my son and a couple of his little friends here for his birthday, they had a blast. We practically had the place to ourselves. The staff was very sweet and the place is clean. Their weekday pricing is a lot cheaper than most other jump parks. We will definitely be trying to go back here in the future.

Review: I would hate to be the owner of this place listening to all these ungrateful people wine about the most ridiculous petty things like they could ever be satisfied! Crying about the price.. if you don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt pay it! If u got a boo boo on ur elbow then ur crying about it needs to be safer.. u knew what it was when u walked thru the doors. Nobody cares what u wished the price was! Pathetic! Bottom line if you don‚Äôt like something about it then go somewhere else! Don‚Äôt sign right up for all the things you want to get online and cry about when you leave! Nobody is even trying to persuade you to come in! So get tough or get out snowflake it‚Äôs that simple‚Ä¶ and sorry there aren‚Äôt any tampons in the men‚Äôs room for the ones I‚Äôm referring to

Review: We came here on Labor Day and they had a great deal for the day of $20 per person for three hours.  Normally it‚Äôs $20 for one hour. Or there is a yearly or fall membership ( no monthly anymore because of scammers I was told) It‚Äôs still a quite pricey to pay $100 for half a days worth of activities, plus another  $20 for the arcade and maybe $10 for chips and drinks at the vending machines , but we had a ton of fun.

Maybe halve of the place is trampolines and the other halve is bouncy castle stuff. I would like to see sofas for adults to sit in as most people have to resort to sitting in the massage chairs or the picnic tables.

When we visited unfortunately the zip line was not functioning and the ball pit is also gone. The x treem bounce trampoline room is really fun to try. Some of the arcade games were broke so you could not play more than one race car game at a time, but I like the overall selection of the arcade games, classic good fun. ( the air hockey is awesome! )

Review: Beware for your children. This place is the absolute worst run jump park. The people (kids) they have working there, have no care in the world. Do not supervise at all. The back super jump area had a bunch of older teenagers hangout out not jumping sitting on the mats, like this is a hangout. Which did not allow my child to jump in the area. The kid worker had to know them because he did nothing at all, just leaning against the wall with his headphones on, asleep. Then the other area is the zipline. Has the dumbest rule of only 3 rides. I get it, if is was busy, but the place is empty, when we were there. No one on the ride. Again the kid workers just hanging out. Say to bad, that's it. The dodge ball area. The balls were popped, just laying in the area. The floor in front of the area is soft about to fall through the floor. The inflatable area is dirty and some of the spots are soft, due to leaks and hard to climb up on. If there is a manager there or owner, when was the last time you walked or inspected the place for basic safety or what your employees are doing? Not in a while. There are too many other jump parks in the area to come here again. The reason we came here was for the one jump area and zip line, could barley use it. On top of the place, being dirty, unkept and not safe. I understand times are different and employees are hard to get. Let's try a little.

Review: We loved it for our family and grand daughters 8th birthday outing. Wide variety of things to do.   2 hours for the 3 grands was plenty to wipe them out for the rest of the day.   The only issues I saw were that the attendants working there were more interested in their phones than doing their jobs, and the massage chairs not being fully functionable.  Neither were enough to take away the 5 stars I gave them.

Review: The zip line coaster has a limit of three times through the ride. There is no line and I‚Äôve watched multiple kids get turned away just so two employees who are both playing around on their phones can do nothing except point out the sign and not have to get off their butts.  This happened last time we were here as well. It‚Äôs my kids favorite thing to do and we may not be back. The employee  a guy who is wearing shorter than average men‚Äôs shorts may also do everyone a favor by not putting his leg up while he‚Äôs sitting doing nothing, thhhhanks.

There should be no limit if it is not causing another patron to wait.Your employees are not overworked or busy, especially the guys running the zip line.

Review: Why is this place still open and allowed to operate.  I'm reading several reviews where someone has gotten hurt do to negligence and bunch of irresponsible little kids that have no training let alone experience.  The owners should be shut down and made to pay for their stupidity.  My 2 year old nephew was seriously injured 2 days ago literally in the same place all the others have been injured.  How can you people sleep at night. With every fight in me And The Good Lord's Help this place won't continue to play stupid to another child injury and then have the nerve to blame the parents.  You are responsible for every one that comes into your park just like any park should be and take SAFETY MEASURES  AT ALL TIMES PRACTICE  AND STOP PAYING ON YA PHONES LIVES ARE AT STAKE!

Review: It was fun until I broke my back!
I had fun at this park until I fractured two vertebrae of my spine! Long story short, there was an (unguarded, uncovered) foam pit which I jumped into in the dark, naturally, thinking it was safe. As I was in the air I realized there was NO foam in the pit and the ground was concrete. Between the height of my jump and my fall, I probably fell a total of 12-15 feet (the pit was seven feet deep‚Ä¶ I measured later on.) I am only alive by the grace of God alone. I could have died.
After the injury, an employee stuck her head over the edge of the pit and asked if I was ok. I could barely speak. I couldn‚Äôt move. She offered me her hand and attempted (unsuccessfully) to pull me out. (Back injury 101‚Ä¶ NEVER move the person.)
When I finally got out, the employee kind of just walked away and nobody at the park followed up, gave me ice packs,or called 911. My friends took me to the hospital.
The result of my injury was two fractured vertibre, eight weeks in a back brace, three rounds of physical therapy, and almost complete immobility for the first few weeks of the injury. It was the worst experimence of my life.
I came to the park with friends a week or two after the incident to see the scene of the crime, measure the pit (why not) and see if it was filled. It was still empty!! There was a girl guarding it who told me just that day, a little boy got back there and she had to rush to get him out of the area before he fell!
I recognize that this story is comedic. I mean who falls into a pit? But I just wanted to warn everyone about this place. It‚Äôs unsafe, the staff is not trained in injury prevention or recovery, and when I contacted the owners later on, they gaslit me and said it was MY fault. They said the had a video of a staff member telling me not to jump and me doing it anyway (funny, I don‚Äôt remember that happening. Why would I PURPOSELY jump into a pit). Don‚Äôt worry! They said no I could NOT see the video, hmmm. They also refused to help me with medical bills.
It should NEVER be possible for someone to fall in a seven foot deep pit with a concrete bottom.
If you or your kids go here, please be VERY careful.

Review: Go if you like spinal compression fractures:

Went here on Jan. 28, 2022 with a group of friends. I had a blast until one of them literally broke her back. Near the end of the night one of the members of my party accidentally bounced into an area of the park that was undergoing maintenance. It was a 7 foot concrete pit! Mind you she was jumping on a trampoline, so she didn‚Äôt fall from ground level, she fell from several feet ABOVE ground level. To be fair, there was a small plastic chain over the entrance, but my friend easily cleared this when she was double bounced in that direction. We‚Äôre estimating that she fell a distance of at least 12 vertical feet in total.

As a result, she suffered a spinal compression fracture that left her in a back brace for 8 weeks. When the injury occurred none of the teenage staff knew what to do, so thank goodness she had friends there who could take her to the emergency room. Not before a well-meaning employee offered my friend her hand and attempted to help her up, however. Word to the wise, if you‚Äôve suffered a spinal compression fracture DO NOT MOVE, it‚Äôll make things worse. In hindsight we should have called 911 and waited for the professionals to put her on a stretcher, but neither we nor the staff knew that at the time.

I wish I was making this up, but my friend is now half an inch shorter and very familiar with her local physical therapy center.

In the interest of fairness, nobody wanted my friend to fall into a 7 foot concrete pit. It even had a little chain and sign. I would argue however, that at a trampoline park, it shouldn‚Äôt be possible to do so. Laws of entropy kind of dictate that masses of bouncing people will eventually land in untended places. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spell out the need for safety nets or protective barriers to the owners of a trampoline park‚Ä¶

Aren‚Äôt there building codes for this kind of thing? Thankfully the victim this time was a 21 year old with fully developed bones. I shudder to think of the consequences if a child had fallen that distance.

Edit: the first picture shows my friend standing in front of the pit a week after the incident. The 7 foot drop had been covered with a red tarp. Notice how dark the area is? The second photo is a clearer view of the pit, and my friend‚Äôs back brace!

We'll be back. It's still a fun safe environment. Especially with security walking around.

Review: I reserved Cypress Sam's Treehouse for my son's birthday. However, I ended up having to cancel the party due to the number of children and adults who were sick. I did not cancel the reservation for Cypress Sam's, though. My son's dad just left this past week and he was already a little sad, but having to cancel his party made things a bit worse. So, we decided to go to the Treehouse despite being the only ones there.

The staff were amazing. They understood why I had to cancel the party, but they jumped in and played with my two boys! They even convinced my oldest to go down the slide, which he had been afraid to do. One of the staff members made an AMAZING birthday card for my son from the Corkan staff. I greatly appreciate all of the staff involved, and I thank you all so much for making my son's day special!

Y'all have to advertise that this indoor kids play house is on a military base and you have to get to the visitors center on the other side to get passes for however long you will be there. And they require the everyone over the age of 17 or 18 has to have a day pass as well. For the people that don't know the area well, this is what you must do. My sister looked this place up and nowhere did it say they were located on a military base. Great little place though to let our kids blow off some energy!! üëç

Review: I have mixed feelings about this place I like but I dont. The staff is not very friendly and two they get upset if you clime in the jungle gym to help your kid. I understand it says no adults above the first level but what do they expect you to do if your toddler gets stuck? They should have made this a little more toddler friendly.

Review: The place overall was nice but they should do a better job at cleaning the facility. The yellow mesh inside of the treehouse is filled with lint and dust. Once the basket tips over from the top it dumps the lint and dust a little bit at a time. I‚Äôve said something to the staff before and they said that it‚Äôll be cleaned that weekend. That was definitely not the case because the particles were still there three weeks later. The next time your in there just go inside of the clear vinyl door strips of the treehouse and look up. It‚Äôll only be a matter of time before someone is effected but their lack of cleaning

Review: Love this place during the summer. Its pretty cheap which is nice and I love that they have toddler time. I think the only downside is that you can't eat food inside but you also can't go get lunch and come back. And the air conditioner is out a lot lately but honestly I'm still gonna keep on taking my kid there.

Review: My experience at Sensory Town was very distasteful. The owner (Kim) treated my guess and I terribly, it was embarrassing. She yelled at us as if she was talking to children, at one point told me to ‚Äúput a pin in it and shut it‚Äù, she stood on the floor the entire time to ‚Äúmonitor us‚Äù as if we were not to be trusted. I have never received such terrible customer service, especially when spending as much money as I did for my son‚Äôs 1st birthday party. After setting up she even threatened to cancel our party multiple times, I personally would not recommend this place to anyone due to the terrible service provider by the owner. Would have been nice but the money spent was not worth being treated like trash. I wish she would have been the one to give me the initial tour of the place because I would have saved my money. Now looking at other google reviews I see the ways she talks to people is an issue for her. Would not recommend

Review: I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. It‚Äôs a sensory-integrated, inclusive play space and it truly shows in every detail.

My boys had an absolute blast! They loved making stained glass during art class, building in the giant block room, swinging on a variety of swings, and sliding down the wooden roller slide (a favorite!). The foam pit, gross motor toys and chairs, and even a bubble dance party kept them entertained the entire time.

Everything is thoughtfully designed to support different sensory needs while keeping it super fun and engaging. It‚Äôs clean, well-organized, and full of exciting activities.

The owner, Kimberly, is incredibly kind and passionate about creating a space where all children feel welcome and included. Her warmth and care really set this place apart.

We will definitely be back. Highly recommend Sensory Town for any parent looking for a fun, safe, and inclusive play experience!

Review: Very disappointed‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt pay until you are inside of the place. You can‚Äôt get a refund even if it isn‚Äôt any fault of your own‚Ä¶ I purchased my ticket online because it said they were open and they weren‚Äôt. They aren‚Äôt willing to give a refund because it costs them but if that is the case then you shouldn‚Äôt allow people to spend money on days that you are closed. I will never in my life come back here, she wants to give a store credit but they are only open during most people‚Äôs work hours and several weekends they are closed for birthday parties. I hope she did credit my ‚Äúaccount‚Äù so someone else I know can take my child since she won‚Äôt refund me for fault of there‚Äôs. For everyone that lives in Jacksonville this was around 2-4 the following day of hurricane Milton, which didn‚Äôt do any damage to Jacksonville‚Ä¶ their website was open for booking this day, google stated they were open and so did their website, but again because she would lose money refunding me the owner is only willing to give store credit.

Review: One Tuesday I went to sensorytown for the first time with my 2-year-old grandson who tends to be a little shy. He was having so much fun playing with the interactive toys that he easily joined with the other children and thoroughly enjoyed his time there. We enjoyed the variety of stimulating toys and experiences that were available.  On the following Friday I returned with my 3-year-old granddaughter. She is a sensory seeker who loves to play with other children and can be kind of rough. It was so much fun to see the different choices that the two very different grandchildren made concerning where they wanted to play and how they wanted to play with the toys and with the other children. But the best part of it is that there was plenty of things for both of The very different children to enjoy.

As far as the magnet area goes, I was very interested in the magnets with the different colored buckets on it and wanted to be able to sort different color magnets into the buckets but was unable to complete such a task since some colored buckets didn‚Äôt have magnets that my daughter could put into them. Not sure if the magnets that were supposed to match up were just missing or if they just weren‚Äôt available.

Review: Owner and/or representative of Sensory Towne, Kimberly provided a unsatisfactory customer service. On Sunday 07/14, I took my daughter to this place to explore it and see if it was a good fit for her. During the registration, a calendar listing all the activities the month of July was provided.
2 days later Tuesday 07/16 at 10: 30am, Per Sensory Towne schedule, my nanny took my daughter to her very first class. After 30 minutes driving to Sensory Towne, they have informed my nanny that the class was not going to happen until noon becuase they have another event scheduled. This demonstrates a lack of professionalism and communication on Sensory towne's representatives. I told them I was not satisfy with the service they were providing on the very first day of service and I did not wish to proceed with them, and Kimberly said that I had a membership of 3 months that I could not cancel. However, they never deliver what they promise in their mission statement, neither they deliver the services they said they offered in their ""membership"".  ""Our mission is to help provide sensory resources for families of all children that will help refine their ability to respond to sensory experiences; nurture, and improve upon their overall childhood development and social skills.  We believe that all children should play together and learn from one another.

Review: We decided to take a mini vacation to JAX from ATL.  We found Sensory Towne in a Google search for things to do in JAX.  My autistic 2yr old grandson thoroughly enjoyed himself. Watching him safely explore the center allowed him to have fun in engaging play areas.  Sensory Towne‚Äôs focus to target the interests of the AU population also kept my 1yr old nephew captivated.  The other parents walked & observed their children interact with others and gave reminders of good choices and redirected if a ‚Äúchill time‚Äù was needed.  The hostess Serayva was welcoming and pleasant.  To the owner of Sensory Towne- Thank you for providing this great place where my grandson and others can feel safe and free to BE. üôèüèΩMaybe one day, you will have an opportunity to enlarge your territory to ATLANTA‚Ä¶. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôÇ Thanks again!

Every child, regardless of ability, can fully participate and have a blast. And don't get me started on the quality of toys - top-notch and engaging, sparking endless creativity. Safety is paramount here, giving parents peace of mind while their little explorers roam freely. Sensory Towne truly sets the standard for a fun, safe, and inclusive play experience.

Review: My husband has brought our son here, but I wanted to check it out for myself yesterday - it was great! I found the check in process easy. There are toys and things for sale within arms reach of small children when you first walk in so be mindful of that, but my son was very easily diverted to the play area. I already intended on buying grip socks as my husband had told me about the rule  - it was about $23 for us to go play with a purchase of socks, I found this perfectly reasonable as we were there for two hours and they have a big variety of toys and equipment. I was truly impressed by how clean it was. In the time we were there I took notice of staff tidying up several times and overheard the owner or manager advising staff to concentrate on certain areas after closing - loved the level of care she displayed. There are so many different areas to explore and activities in each area. My son was entertained from the moment we arrived to the moment we left and had a good nap afterwards - exactly what I wanted! So happy we have this place on our radar.

Review: I booked a party for my daughter's first birthday party. I had to cancel due to some very personal reasons. I cancelled way ahead of time at that! I was told that I had store credit to when I come to Jax, I can use my store credit of $100 to pay for the entry of my kids etc. remind you I called more than once throughout the year to make sure, everything was straight. The people I talked to told me I still had a credit of $100. They didn't mention I had a time limit and they didn't mention that my credit is gone. I called a month and half ago AGAIN!!! Just to see if things was still okay and they advise me to call when it gets closer to the date I wanted to come and bring my child, so I did just that and now I'm being told that since it was 15 months ago I have no credit, that it expired and she sees where I made the deposit but doesn't see the credit on my file! It just disappeared when she got on the screen but everyone else that I spoke to said otherwise. Now I got to make other plans because of this!!

Review: We have been a couple of times. It is definitely a fun time for the kids and they always have a blast! It feels clean too, so I think the stars are warranted. However, I do have a couple of issues:

1. The price. We paid $77.40 for my four kids to play (plus socks), one of them being under 1 year old. They do charge for infants 6 months and older, for which I feel is poor taste. Most places do not charge infants for a ticket for entry. They do require the parents to wear socks even if the parent isn't going to be playing. So that's even more money that you'll have to be paying. I could literally have taken my kids to marine land for less because they don't charge for kids under 4 y/o. I just feel like with this economy, only the wealthy can really afford to come to a place like this which is so sad. I know they will say that everywhere charges the same, but that's simply not true. We have been around the block and have tried lots of other indoor play places.

2. They have toys laid all around in the check-in area for purchase, within hands-reach of little ones. Naturally they are going to be excited and want to look. But the owner immediately confronted my kids for picking up the toys as soon as we walked in the door. Their expectation is that the children are not to touch any of the toys on display. I can understand this, but perhaps it might be helpful to keep them out of arms reach if this is the expectation as it's very unrealistic to expect children to not want to check out all of the neat things!

3. I am not trying to be mean because that's not my intention, but the owner is VERY helicopter-like as soon as you arrive... Barking orders at you and your children, reciting all of the rules in rapid-fire sequence, correcting your children, reading the policies, asking questions, grabbing your payment info, having you sign waivers, and trying to get you to sign up for a membership, all at the same time, before you've even walked into the play area. There was just so much going on, all while I was trying to keep an eye on my 4 kids and make sure they didn't touch anything! I am a pretty calm person in general, and I understand needing to have rules, but I could feel my blood pressure rising during this bizarre interaction. It was very intense! Be prepared for that. It was exactly like that both times we have been. I do realize that it could have been our personalities just clashing too, but perhaps my perspective could help some as I'm sure I'm not the first person to have felt this way.

4. I called beforehand about 10 minutes before to see if they were busy as it was spring break week. I was told that it was ""not too bad"". When we got there, after we checked in, I heard them turning another family away because they were now at ""full capacity"" even though that family prepaid for their spots online. The place was completely jam packed. I felt this was a little deceptive of them. Had we known how crazy it would have been inside, we probably wouldn't have come.

Don't get me wrong, the kids love it here. But I feel that it is also important for the parents to have a peaceful, pleasant experience, especially for the money we are paying. I hope my review is helpful to other parents who are curious about this place.

Review: We booked the private party for my sons 4th birthday and it was SO amazing! Savara and Nia were absolutely wonderful. I had asked my friends to come early to help me set up and they weren‚Äôt even needed as Savara and Nia were on it! They went above and beyond to make my vision come to life and took all the stress out of party planning for me. They also interacted with all the kids so the parents could relax and everyone had a blast. We love Sensory Towne and can‚Äôt wait to come back!

Review: This place is wonderful! I always leave thinking that and realized it's time to write a review and tell others. Everything at Sensory Towne is so thoughtful, inclusive, perfect for a range of ages, clean, amazing value for the price, and the owner and team members are so friendly. We've been several times since discovering it last year. They often plan fun events like the pumpkin decorating event that we attended today, which our 2-year-old absolutely loved! We really enjoy the music class with Ashton as well. An hour of play is also included with the events, such as music class and pumpkin decorating, which is such a great deal! So happy to have found Sensory Towne.

Review: As a parent of an energetic 2 yr old, I can‚Äôt express how thrilled I am with this indoor play area! It‚Äôs an absolute gem for both kids and parents alike. The facility is thoughtfully designed, with multiple play areas that cater to different types of sensory stimulation. Whether it‚Äôs climbing, sliding, or imaginative play, there‚Äôs something for every little adventurer.

What sets this place apart is their commitment to creating a wholesome experience. The monthly activities organized for the kids are a fantastic addition. It keeps things fresh and engaging, ensuring there‚Äôs always something new to discover. And let‚Äôs not forget about the genius late-night sessions! Finally, parents can have a well-deserved date night while their kids have a blast in a safe and supervised environment.

The staff here deserves a special mention‚Äîthey are friendly, attentive, and truly understand the needs of young children. The cleanliness and maintenance of the play area are top-notch, giving parents peace of mind.

Overall, this indoor play area gets a resounding four-star rating from me. It‚Äôs a haven for children‚Äôs play and a sanctuary for parents‚Äô sanity. Keep up the excellent work!

Review: This Place is totally amazing! God bless Kim because she brought to life a center where my son could actually enjoy himself. My son ,  He‚Äôs usually not fond of new environments and experiences but as soon as he walked in the door he gravitated towards the ball pit and then to other areas as well. I especially loved the calm spa (cool down room) - The Sensory items in the gift shop were 10/10 from the weighted blankets to the swings and fidgets - This place is special. My son enjoyed himself so much It was a fight to get him to leave.

Downside...it seemed rushed. 400.00 for an hour and a half of play. Guests came at staggered times and didn't get to enjoy the full festivities which was completely not sensorytowns fault.However everything seemed rushed. The young lady who was servicing us literally made it feel like a big blur. Just doing her job but I think I prefer Mygym over sensorytown.

Review: We had my daughters 5th birthday here and it was awesome! All of the kids (ages 9 months to 10 years) had a blast and there was a lot for all of them to do. The employees were very kind and helpful. I booked the party easily online and used the information given from the website in order to make sure myself and our guests were prepared for the party but my main complaint would be that it seemed like the employees running the party expected me to know more than I did so I would just suggest you communicate with them over the phone or in person instead of solely following the information off of their website. I also think it's slightly overpriced.

So this place was an absolute godsend. the owner Miss Kimberly is super nice and has created a real gem of a place for kids of a wide range of ages. Our son had the best time exploring all the cute little details and colorful toys. He also really enjoyed watching older kids and try to imitate whatever they did. If you‚Äòre ever in the area or even live there, make sure to stop by!

My daughter is nonverbal autistic, and the only problem we ever have here is trying to leave. We signed up for a membership which is extremely reasonably priced. The staff is always so nice and welcoming. If you have small children and are looking for something for them to do, especially on these rainy days, I highly recommend Sensory Towne.

Review: Kim and her team have truly created something very special! The moment my fianc√© and I walked through the doors with our little one that Superman‚Äôs through the challenges of living with cerebral palsy everyday, felt incredibly welcomed and genuinely cared for. Even one of the girls on the team took the time to show us which fun play rooms and amenities would be the best to try first and then continued to be generously attentive through out our play date that afternoon to make sure our experience was everything we hoped for. But what I love most about Sensory Towne is that every child whether they have a unique way of life living life or not has a space to connect with each other equally and are given the opportunity to learn the beauty of embracing everyone as they are.

Adults get free coffee; additional inexpensive snacks are available for tots and parents. I‚Äôm so glad we found MGW shortly after it opened and purchased a membership; we have weekly play dates with families we met there. I also bought a pass for my grandchildren. Ms. Jessica offers tumbling and music at MGW and she does a fabulous job, too! We live about 45minutes from MGW but it is well worth the drive.

It's very clean, I'm able to get lots of work done as my toddlers play, we bring lots of snacks + lunch and stay for hours. There is a free coffee bar, along with snacks and other beverages you can purchase. The enrichment classes (music/movement & tumble) are the highlights of my kids week, they love Ms. Jessica!
The owner, Deidra, and staff are all very kind, polite, and professional. I can't recommend this place enough!

Review: They charged us $20 for my 9 year old daughter to go in with my 2 year old grandson (he was $10). I‚Äôm still confused why we were charged for her. There was absolutely nothing for her to do there. It‚Äôs for toddlers and preschoolers. So why were we charged $20 extra dollars? My grandson had a great time as it was worth the $10 for him but not happy about being charged $20 for my 9 year old daughter to sit at a table and watch. Ridiculous

She was able to run, play, and meet new friends. The staff are so polite and the toys and space give the kids a great interactive experience! Thanks guys!

Review: We had a fantastic time at Macon Giggles and Wiggles! We participated in the tumbling class this morning and my daughter had a blast and caught on quickly. The instructor was so personable and fun for the kids.

My 22 month old and almost 4 year old had so much fun exploring all of the stations and toys. Everything was extremely well thought out and CLEAN. Even the bathrooms were spotless. Such a great place for a change of scenery for my girls, we will definitely be back!

Review: Birthday party planning was a breeze! I contacted the owner through Facebook messenger,  I was able to pay through an app. The atmosphere of the play room is great and there's a variety of activities for kids of all ages. The owner gave me 30 minutes before the party to setup in the party room, and we reserved the party room for 3 hours. The kids enjoyed playing in the playplace during the 3 hours we had scheduled. Would definitely recommend to friends!

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

The venue was exceptionally clean, and I hope it remains so, given its new status in Opelika. I would like to offer a suggestion regarding the pizza options. While Marco's pizza did not agree with my children's stomachs, incorporating Papa John's pizza as an alternative would be a welcome addition, particularly for parties. I am planning to host a party there this October.

Review: Wonderful experience for my boys who are 4 and 5. Very affordable!  90 minutes was plenty of time for the session. My children were able to play the arcade games, play on the indoor structures and play on the rock climbing wall which they really liked! We did not purchase any food or drinks however they did have a variety of snacks for purchase and Pizza if you wanted something hot. The facility was clean and cool, with seats for parents located in the middle of the structures so that you can easily see your child. Great place for getting all of the wiggles out of energetic littles! Reminds me of a place that was around when I was a child in the 90's called ""Discovery Zone"".

An hour and a half was the perfect amount of time for my kids and then we got a slice of pizza, Pringle‚Äôs and skittles for a quick fun lunch in the concessions before we left! You can add more time if you are not ready to leave, but for our stage of toddlers/babies, it was the perfect amount!
We are going back to Funtastic ASAP!

Review: Such a good experience for us that I have to post a review because I want to see this business thrive. I believe this location is new; it was certainly new to us and I‚Äôm so glad they are here because we need more indoor play places near Columbus. Funtastic is an indoor play place good for ages 1 (infant crawlers and even new walkers) through 12 and has areas sectioned off according to age. One of the selling points for us is how open the play area is so you can almost easily spot out your kids no matter where you were seated (another win, some places we have been to don‚Äôt have the kind of set up to easily supervise your kids). We just happened to not only be there at opening time but at a good time where there wasn‚Äôt too many kids there to play so space to play/run around was good. The facility was clean (this includes even the restroom) AND well lit so another win. Again we were there shortly after the play area was open for the day but we saw staff actively clean/sanitize when they could. Towards the end of the time (90 minute play time per play pass) we were reminded we could also extend our time if need be which is enforced based on the color wristband we were given at the beginning. I had to point out to the staff (who were not only helpful, they were polite and professional) I really appreciate that system. We will certainly be back when we are in the area.

One staff member even noticed that my three year old daughter was picking up the balls and putting them back inside the ball pit, without being asked and she came over to me and gave me a play card with four credits on it so that my daughter could play at the arcade! This is a great place and I'm hoping it stays in this area for a long time!

They made planning this party so easy. They provide a link to send with the invites. As people register and complete the waiver, you get an email with an updated guest list. The party planner called and emailed several times to answer my questions and offer assistance. It is a little more expensive than some of our other options, but pizza and drinks are included so it works out to be better and easier.

Review: Very nice space to rent for a party. The owner is so helpful at the start and not having to worry about clean up is fantastic. There is plenty of toys for all the kiddos to enjoy and the cutest little areas set up for eating.

There are two things that for me, keep at from 5 stars. One of which is the bathroom situation. I personally am not comfortable with a multi stall, unisex bathroom and neither were any of my guests. This resulted in a lot of time knocking to ensure the opposite sex wasn't in there and could be easily solved with a lock on the door so it could be single use.

The second thing, that I am grateful my parents stumbled on before any children was that there were multiple LGBTQ books. Myself as well as our entire group are Christians and do not believe in things like that being taught to young children (no different than if there were sex education books) For a place like this I wouldn't have even thought there'd be books like that. I assumed ABC books, colors etc. Luckily my parents saw them, and put them up for the duration of the party, but if you are Christian or simply so not believe those are age appropriate books, it was simple enough to move them for the party. Less simple however, if you go for open play.

Overall though, great space and would recommend:)

We are actually from Florida and are just in the area visiting family for the summer but aren‚Äôt familiar to Maine much at all. But I saw the reviews and it sounded perfect. I called and left a voicemail and the owner called me back within a few minutes. She informed me that there was availability and she was so sweet and accommodating. We arrived and had the best time! I love the little details she put into making the space fun, interactive, educational and relaxing. I felt safe letting my kiddos run around and play- not worrying about if they could get hurt or if I couldn‚Äôt see them. There was even a little spot in the back that had snacks, drinks and even coffee! If I lived nearby I would absolutely come here often with my littles. Great place to mingle with other parents, play with your kids on a rainy day, or even sit down and use the WiFi to get some work done while the kids are entertained. I cannot recommend this place enough and I hope her business thrives! *Woman/ mother owned and operated! ü´∂

Review: If you're looking for the ultimate indoor playground for your little one's birthday bash, look no further than The Village. From start to finish, our experience at The Village was nothing short of fantastic.

The owner's assistance was invaluable from the moment we inquired about hosting our child's birthday party there. They were incredibly helpful, offering suggestions and accommodating our requests to ensure everything ran smoothly on the big day.

The facilities at The Village are simply superb. The play areas are thoughtfully designed to engage and entertain toddlers of all ages, with plenty of colorful equipment to climb, slide, and explore. The safety measures in place gave us peace of mind as our little guests reveled in the excitement.

Overall, our experience at The Village exceeded our expectations in every way. We had a blast, and our little one couldn't stop talking about how much fun they had. Without a doubt, we would highly recommend The Village to any parent looking for the ideal venue for their child's birthday party.

The other thing that is a MAJOR win for us is that we are a 2 mom household and our family has been welcomed with open arms at The Village! At other playrooms, we have not felt welcomed and really appreciate this about Chyna and Bryce. When they say LGBTQ+ are welcome in the space, they truly mean it!

Review: I reserved Cypress Sam's Treehouse for my son's birthday. However, I ended up having to cancel the party due to the number of children and adults who were sick. I did not cancel the reservation for Cypress Sam's, though. My son's dad just left this past week and he was already a little sad, but having to cancel his party made things a bit worse. So, we decided to go to the Treehouse despite being the only ones there.

The staff were amazing. They understood why I had to cancel the party, but they jumped in and played with my two boys! They even convinced my oldest to go down the slide, which he had been afraid to do. One of the staff members made an AMAZING birthday card for my son from the Corkan staff. I greatly appreciate all of the staff involved, and I thank you all so much for making my son's day special!

Review: Awesome ü§© place to bring the little ones to get that much needed social interaction with other kids. The first level of three is where the adults can play with their kids. Levels 2 and above are for the children only. Unless help is needed. There are cool air machines inside the main area. It‚Äôs built like a fortress. Great for a game of Command and Conquer! There is no food allowed, which in my opinion will keep the place as clean as possible. Like it is now. Very clean and fresh! Wonderful staff also.

My complaint and why I gave it 2 stars is because the place is really dirty. It definitely NEEDS a deep clean or something, especially when they want us to not wear shoes in there, it definitely makes me feel icky. Although it seems like a fun place, but please maintain it better in regards to having it be cleaned.

Review: I came here with my kids and my sister and her kids. I loved it, and so did the kids. If I can point out one thing. Y'all have to advertise that this indoor kids play house is on a military base and you have to get to the visitors center on the other side to get passes for however long you will be there. And they require the everyone over the age of 17 or 18 has to have a day pass as well. For the people that don't know the area well, this is what you must do. My sister looked this place up and nowhere did it say they were located on a military base. Great little place though to let our kids blow off some energy!! üëç

My suggestion to management is to have people sign in at the time they arrived and give them 2 hours of play. So the same people aren't there for 3/4 plus hours keeping it at full capacity and others can't come in and leave with screaming disappointed children.

Review: The place overall was nice but they should do a better job at cleaning the facility. The yellow mesh inside of the treehouse is filled with lint and dust. Once the basket tips over from the top it dumps the lint and dust a little bit at a time. I‚Äôve said something to the staff before and they said that it‚Äôll be cleaned that weekend. That was definitely not the case because the particles were still there three weeks later. The next time your in there just go inside of the clear vinyl door strips of the treehouse and look up. It‚Äôll only be a matter of time before someone is effected but their lack of cleaning

They require a $200 deposit which is fine and then require the rest the day of the party. (Also have never paid taxes on a deposit) ‚Äútaxes‚Äù I asked if I could pay for the rest of the party as we were leaving because I wanted to go to the party room and record my daughters reaction to the decorations, I was told no I had to pay right then like I wasn‚Äôt going to pay the bill or whatever, while being told that‚Äôs what I had to do my daughter ran to the room as she saw family going in there and I didn‚Äôt get to see her reaction or record it because they wanted to be difficult, so thanks for ruining that moment for us, we were regular customers, we won‚Äôt be back.

But the day we celebrated - the lady was very insensitive - the gym had a peculiar stink - she did not have any room freshener - it was very warm in there - I asked her to lower the AC temperature n she didnt have the remote control to the AC ( said the manager has locked it and wont be in before the party ends). Also at the time of wrapping up, she was very insensitive - she quickly threw away everything without even checking with me n my husband and trashed most of our stuff which we could have brought back as memories from the Birthday party. She was least interested in participating or helping out. Pls make sure who is going to be present when you celebrate your little one s special day because u don‚Äôt want it to be ruined by unkind insensitive people.

Review: It was a nice place, a big room to play around,  my son's liked it. However, there were two items that were broken. There is a slide with multi colored bolsters  and the green slide in the back. The slide in the back had a crack towards the bottom, so it was covered with tape. The tape started to come up and someone notified the employee but really didn't do anything about it. I let her know about the bolsters slide, that one of them is broken and a child could potential fall and  hurt themselves. Hopefully they will fix it. Other than that, it was clean, and we will give it some time to come back so those issues can be fixed or replaced.

We arrived around 2:30 pm and found a parking spot in the parking lot. When I walked in, I was greeted warmly by a young woman at the register. I was able to get registered and pay $15 for the visit. We put our backpack and shoes in one of the cubbies lining one side of the lobby. They had snacks, drinks, and merchandise for sale. The gated play area is huge, with a variety of play areas and equipment, including a jungle gym, kidkraft playhouse, climbing wall, rope climbing net, swings, and the most popular of all, a Zipline that all the kids wanted to play on. We started at the area with the puzzles on the wall, then worked our way to the toddler fenced area. There were quite a few kids of all ages playing, but we didn't feel trampled on nor did my son react negatively to having kids near him. His favorite things turned out to be the puzzle wall, the light up fish tube in the back, and the pots and pans at the kidkraft playhouse. I ended up meeting two parents that were super friendly and helpful, and my son surprised me by playing ball with both of them, which he never does with strangers. I felt relieved that my son fit in with the kids and that I wasn't alone in having a special child. Most gyms I have felt anxiety because my son isn't like the other children of the same age, but I felt at home here. Thank you to the staff and parents for this welcoming experience, and I hope to be back with him soon!

Staff was incredibly helpful, welcoming, accommodating and they went above and beyond to make our sons party go so smoothly. From setting up decorations for us, fun activities, serving the cake and pizza. This was by far the most stress-free kids party experience we have ever had. Everyone at the party raved about how much fun they had as well! 1000/10 recommend for a day of fun or a party for your little one.

Review: We've been here twice within the last year.
Everything is actually pretty dirty, I've never seen
anybody cleaning. No areas for climbing except a
small rock wall.
It's supposed to be a gated area, but the last time
we went (about a week ago), the gate was open
almost the whole time we were there (2 hours),
even after asking an employee to keep it closed. At one point the front door and the gate were both
wide open, which is frankly unacceptable in a place that claims it's inclusive for children with special needs. It's hard to even find an employee if you have a concern. Employees were more concerned with setting up a last minute birthday party than addressing our concerns. While we were there, a family walked up and were turned away because of the last minute party, even though they stated they had called ahead of time as their website suggests, and drove 30 minutes to get there. This place seems like an absolute mess. Would not recommend
coming here.

Just an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and what‚Äôs worse they just continue to do it. They don‚Äôt even fix the issues. So definitely call the webpage is a waste of time

The set up in the main area worked perfect for the amount of guest they allow, the party price was amazing, and I loved that they gave us a checklist of expectations cleaning up, and the owner was really helpful with any questions we had leading up to and during the party. We will definitely be back to play here. My son didn‚Äôt even want to stop playing for cake so that says a lot. The only negative thing I could say is it be nice to have a broom along with the vacuum for clean up and an extra trash bag would have been helpful but overall this was an amazing experience and totally worth it.

I sat for two hours during one visit and watched the staff clean nonstop while the kids played. Every time someone got up from a table, it was immediately wiped down. If crumbs hit the floor, they were vacuumed right away. I‚Äôve never seen a place take cleanliness this seriously‚Ä¶ I love it.

What makes the Play Jungle even more special are the people, especially Ms. Miranda and Mr. Raheem. My daughter always looks forward to seeing them. Ms. Miranda never brushes her off. Instead, she takes the time to talk to her behind the counter which makes my daughter smile every time.

I‚Äôve also noticed that whenever a child is upset, Ms. Miranda is quick to respond. Whether it‚Äôs offering a toy, a balloon, or just a kind word, she goes out of her way to make sure every child feels cared for. She‚Äôs always walking around, watching attentively, and doing what she can to make each kid‚Äôs experience better.

This place is small, cozy, and truly family friendly. The level of care and attention they give makes all the difference.

Review: The place is kinda small and a little expensive for a playground.  Then again, if you compare it to everything else that isn't free, its not bad. That being said my 3 and 7 year olds enjoyed every minute! If you have rowdy kids and want to kill two hours without dying of heat exhaustion its a good option! Edit *Has ""couches"" and charging ports for the parents*

Review: I just wanted to remind my fellow community that Lisa Church and her family started this business to serve the community. To bring something fun for family‚Äôs to do in a safe, welcoming atmosphere. She is a busy mom on top of being a busy business owner. Let‚Äôs all give them grace as they work out the kinks and try hard to make it the best possible spot for kids to play. It‚Äôs HARD to please everyone but they are sure trying. Just a reminder that harsh reviews and word of mouth can kill a local business. Allow them to adjust, speak your concerns to them but then extend grace. We‚Äôve all started something new at some point and needed time to improve. ‚ù§Ô∏è I think they are doing a fabulous job!

Review: ‚ú® A Truly Magical Unicorn Party Experience! ü¶Ñüéâ

I recently hosted my daughter‚Äôs unicorn-themed birthday party at my friend and neighbor‚Äôs indoor play yard, and it was absolutely magical! From start to finish, everything was completely stress-free. The team paid close attention to every detail and made sure both our family and party guests felt cared for and celebrated.

They provided everything‚Äîfrom food, drinks, cupcakes, and d√©cor to customized party favor bags to thank our guests. All I had to do was show up, greet our loved ones, and enjoy the day. It was truly a 10/10 experience!

The indoor play area itself is fantastic. It features age-appropriate play zones and themes for toddlers through older school-age kids, making it a perfect choice for mixed-age parties. The space is fully air-conditioned, which is a lifesaver during the hot Florida summer, and it‚Äôs a great solution for letting the kids burn off energy while staying cool and safe indoors.

Plus, it has Wi-Fi and a snack bar, which made it easy for parents to relax and enjoy themselves too!

I wholeheartedly recommend this venue to any parent looking for a stress-free, joy-filled, and unforgettable celebration. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!

Review: My 1 yo and 9 yo children loved Play Jungle! 100000/10 rating from our family. It was very clean and very affordable. And the location was so close to our house which is a plus 100000 for us, as we do not have to go far for our kids to play in an indoor playground. The employees were very friendly and nice too! (the guy and the gal) That‚Äôs why we came back the very next day to play again. Once we are back in Jacksonville we‚Äôll definitely purchase the membership.

Review: It was a great play gym and seemed clean. It is absolutely a child‚Äôs dream to play here! The reason for 3 stars is as follows:
- too many people allowed to play at once. Doesn‚Äôt seem like there is a regulation on the two hour rules.
- too many people over the age of 12/14 years old playing in the play gym. I honestly think this is too old. They were pushing and bullying other kids and rough housing and when your 2 and 4 year old just want to have honest fun but a 12 year old pummels over them, it isn‚Äôt that great.
- no regulation of people wearing socks. We saw multiple people jumping in ball pits with bare feet which is just unsanitary.

Overall it is a great place and if the point above are addressed it could be an exceptional place.

Review: First, I want to say that the play structure for the older kids is great. However, the price for 2 kids and only for 2 hours is not worth it. The toddler area is okay, the ball pit takes up most of the space and then my 1 year was being trampled over by older kids. I will not be going back.

Also, the area for the babies is not really separated from the older kids, so they can get knocked over easily. Sure, it‚Äôs a cleanish place because they just opened up.

Review: 5 Stars ‚Äì A Hidden Gem with Heart!

We had the most wonderful experience at Play Jungle! We accidentally showed up on a day they weren‚Äôt open to the public‚Äîjust as the owner was getting things ready for the week. Instead of turning us away, she welcomed us in with such kindness and understanding, especially after learning we had traveled from far away.

Her generosity and warmth truly left an impression on me. It‚Äôs rare to come across business owners who go out of their way like that, and I‚Äôm so grateful we crossed paths.

The space itself is absolutely adorable‚Äîsuper clean, thoughtfully designed, and the play equipment is not only safe but also so fun and inviting for kids.

We will absolutely be back and I‚Äôll be recommending Play Jungle to everyone looking for a fun, safe, and welcoming place for their little ones to play. Thank you again for your kindness‚Äîit meant the world to us!

Review: The place has been open for three weeks now, and I decided to check it out as soon as I found out about it.  It's located near the St. Augustine outlets, offering plenty of free parking. Everything is clean and, of course, new inside.  There is a ball pool, slide, trampoline, play kitchen, etc. It's a bit tight, but plenty big enough for kids to play. There are tables for parents to sit at. No food or drinks are available so far, except cake pops.

$16 for 2 hours.

I just wish parents would be more responsible and not bring their sick children! I was there with my 10-month-old, and there were other infants. One toddler had a severe cough and unstoppable runny nose. Yes, the lady at the front asks about illness, but she can't check it. Or, please, teach your children to cough into the inside of their elbow. Thank you! My daughter has been able to do that since she was two years old.

Review: This was our second time celebrating our son's birthday at The Nestling Collective. They did not disappoint. We had a Bluey themed party and they had an option to have Bluey visit during our party. The kids were so excited when she came out. The smiles on their faces were priceless. Jessica and her team are the best and the facility is so clean.

Review: We just held my daughter‚Äôs first birthday party here and it was perfect! Everything is so clean and tidy. The private room is the perfect size and I love the glass windows they have in the room so you can look out into the play space. The play room has lots of different toys and activities but is still very spacious.

Review: The experience was average. We arrived before 10am and stayed for a couple of hours.

The water table, toy selection, and indoor play set were amazing. We loved seeing such a selection upon arrival.

Where we ran into some hiccups were with the cleanliness. Both in the space itself, and with the volume of toys out.
It felt like the space could use a good sweep/vacuum/mopping. The play area is sock/barefoot only and we left with very dirty socks/feet. There were crumbs on the floor, under toys, and under furniture. I spent time picking up while my youngest was finding and trying to eat the crumbs while exploring.
We dealt with a bit of overwhelm/overstimulation, as the space wasn‚Äôt picked up during the couple of hours that we were there. Other play spaces that we‚Äôve visited are frequently picked up by a staff member to try to avoid the overstimulation that can happen. This just really elevates the experience, and seems to help children explore and imagine in a space.

This is the most we‚Äôve ever paid to access a play space, and for the dollar amount paid we just had higher expectations.

It‚Äôs a nice thing to have in the area, but we won‚Äôt be back and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd recommend it to our friends.

Review: My daughter second birthday party at the Nestling Collective was nothing short of perfect! I opted for the all inclusive package so not having to worry about decorations or goodie bags was so great! It was also so great to have to entertain little ones but gently supervise while they have the time of their lives. They were so helpful with helping us carry out gifts & left over food! The decorations were PERFECT! 10/10 recommend!

I‚Äôll be back for regular playtime also! My daughter had so much fun

The team at Nestling Collective made this the best experience for our birthday girl as well as our friends and family! The team was even willing to accommodate last minute additions to the extras. The Nestling Collective really cared about all of the details to make this occasion extra special! As a mom, I usually have to spend so much time preparing before a party and cleaning after the party, but the team did everything for us! I am extremely grateful for all of their help so I could just enjoy watching my child smile and celebrate with our friends and family!! Thank you thank you thank you Nestling Collective! It was a magical celebration and I truly can‚Äôt say enough good things about this venue!

Review: You know when you meet up with a mom friend at a playground or park and you're like oh, it's going to be great to catch up while our kids play, but then you realized you're just waving at each other from across the park? This is not that place. This is the place where you can actually talk with friends while your kids play. I've never experienced anything quite like it. I'm so sad I was only in Jacksonville to visit a good friend, because we have nothing like this in the DC area that I've found.

The layout is perfect. Clear sight lines throughout, comfortable couches for parents and caregivers, snacks, drinks, I mean, it really does feel like you're at your best friend's house except it's always being cleaned by a cleaning fairy. Spill? Gone in seconds. Thinking 'oh boy that water feature isn't going to end well!' but wait, they already thought ahead and put waterproof smocks out. Like all the preplanning you have to do as a caregiver has already been done for you. They have a toddler sized toilet!!!!!!

The toys and stations must have been selected by some parenting guru/magician, my child was entertained and could have been for hours and hours. They've been begging to go back ""to nestleen!"" and doesn't quite get that DC to FL isn't just a jump in the car kind of trip.

We love The Nestling Collective, I wish we lived closer. Everyone I was introduced to was so kind, funny, and welcoming, it was like I'd known them for all of parenthood. My child can't wait to go back and visit and neither can I.

Review: Sometimes I think I spend more time here than at home. I attended a trial day when The Nestling Collective first opened last year and decided to purchase a monthly membership, just for the Summer. The more time I spent there, the more I knew I couldn't let it go. There are so many things I love about this space.
It feels like hanging out in your best friend's living room. It's a
big open space with comfortable seating, and play stations interspersed around the room.
The regulars are wonderful people. We don't have family in town, but I've created a little community and traded numbers with many people I met at The Nest. Every time you walk in there is a friendly face waiting to say hello.
And speaking of friendly faces...the owner and staff are incredible. They're moms too, and it's obvious from the level of thought and care they put into this space. They're constantly cleaning, organizing, planning activities.
Have I mentioned the activities? There is something new to do every day. I do pretty OK with planning kid activities but they take it to the next level with creative sensory bins and tactile activities.
Go. You'll be so glad you did.

There are new toys and little activities that keep it fun and interesting for her. The employees always greet us with a smile and are endlessly cleaning the toys to keep the space safe and clean. Not only is this place great for kiddos, but a welcoming place to meet new mom friends too!

Review: I was not very impressed with the Nesting Collective, especially for the price. I‚Äôve heard great things and wanted to try it out. It was dirty, there were toys everywhere and it just looked overall messy. There was food on the floor by the children‚Äôs table that we asked to be cleaned. It did not give off a clean vibe. There were no paper towels in the bathroom. The employee working there was in the back room and kept leaving the door open with kids around. She should have been up front tidying up and putting toys back to avoid safety hazards.

I also noticed from previous pictures, some equipment was missing. Looks like they had a big walkway and slide and that is not there. It looks empty for the space. I think for what is there, the price should be 15-20$

I have been to another play place and it was much cleaner and they have a cafe! They also have play sessions you reserve and it‚Äôs to clean in between. Hopefully they can make some changes!

Review: We had my son's 3rd birthday party at The Nestling Collective, and I couldn't be happier with how everything turned out! The communication from the team was excellent from start to finish, making the entire process stress free and simple. Unlike our usual home parties that require weeks of planning and decorating leaving me exhausted and with a giant mess to clean! We simply show up with the cake and food and enjoy time with our guests and kids. I was pleasantly surprised by the decorations provided, which far exceeded my expectations. The staff there to help facilitate the party and guide guests through transitions were incredibly helpful and pleasant. Since then, we've attended other parties at The Nestling Collective and will definitely be booking all our kids' parties here until they outgrow the space. 10/10 place to host any party for the kiddos!

Review: I came with my 2 year old son and paid $26.75, only to have my son ostracized in front of staff and have them do nothing about it. I understand older kids can be temperamental but I witnessed the staff and owner too preoccupied gossiping with the parents of said kids, to intervene once they had corralled all the toys in the entire place to one corner. This all happened over the span of 30 minutes, for reference. I‚Äôm aware that I can‚Äôt control the parenting or lack of other people, but this place has a bias and isn‚Äôt worth the ridiculous cost when not all kids are treated fairly.

Woman and mom owned, this is a great place for the Beaches community. They even opened up when Duval County was closed for a recent storm. As a working mom who wanted a break with her kid for an hour when it was  pouring outside this was so needed. Oh and hot coffee on early weekend mornings!!

The $25 per play day is so worth it. The owner, Jessica, was so welcoming and throughly explained what they offer. My son is 2 1/2, and can sometimes be very overwhelmed exploring new play areas. It took him less than five minutes to feel comfortable enough to play with everything! He wasn‚Äôt meandering around bored at all. This is an area where parents can also feel comfortable enough to take a breather on one of the many couches in every play area and still watch their kids.

Review: I recently had the pleasure of visiting The Nestling Collective, and it was an outstanding experience! This play space truly prioritizes the holistic growth and intellectual curiosity of children. The stimulating environment is designed to promote cognitive development through a range of enriching experiences that captivate and engage young minds.

The early learning classes offered are phenomenal, providing children with the foundational skills they need in a fun and interactive way. The educators are passionate and dedicated, ensuring each child receives personalized attention and support. The space itself is safe and supportive, allowing parents to feel confident in their child's well-being. The water play table and the STEM-themed fort at the center of the play area are standout features that encourage hands-on learning and imaginative play.

What sets The Nestling Collective apart is their thoughtful inclusion of a lounge area for adults. This space is perfect for parents to relax and connect with one another while their children explore and learn. The sense of community here is truly special, with regular community events that bring families together and foster strong relationships.

Additionally, The Nestling Collective is an excellent venue for birthday parties. The staff goes above and beyond to create memorable and enjoyable celebrations for kids of all ages.

Overall, The Nestling Collective is a fantastic resource for families seeking a nurturing and stimulating environment for their children. The combination of enriching experiences, a supportive community, and dedicated staff makes it a top choice for early childhood development. Highly recommend!

The place is spotless and the little touches really pull it together. Comfy seating all over and the cutest rugs to make it cozy.

Make sure to bring a change of clothes just in case. Little ones go wild at the water feature.
My little guy loved the water feature, the BIG slide but his favorites were the fire trucks. They also have a small area kinda blocked off for crawlers. Such a thoughtful touch!

Review: Instead of a birthday party I had a play date party for my son here for him and his classmates. Drop-n-Play was the perfect place to have a play date. The staff was nice. The place was just the right size where you can see the kids play no matter where you are in the building. The kids had so much fun here. I highly recommend this place for your kiddos.

We usually go in the mornings and have it to ourselves or in the afternoon and he can play with other kiddos. Sumayia, the owner is so nice and amazing with kids, we love all of the staff! He has really improved in his climbing and walking skills and gets so excited every time we come!

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

Everything is duct taped, zipped tied down, missing pieces, exposed wires, and poles the matted floors are buckling up which poses a tripping hazard they really need to be shut down. smfh.

There's other areas are in dire NEED to be fixed ASAP!!! Has the big slides near the bottom taped but wasn't secured trampolines are all taped wasn't secured...

Review: This place is a safety hazard‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è In the 1-3 toddler section, there are metal poles sticking up from the ground that they wrapped in pool noodles(with the top exposed for a child to put their hand in). The foam mats are bulging (my child tripped over the bulge twice), and have gaps in between each other. The kitchen lights were off you couldn‚Äôt even tell it was open. When you walk in, you take your shoes off and head to the person at the desk. You write your child‚Äôs name down in their log book. There isn‚Äôt a sign displayed or an injury liability waiver you sign saying ‚Äúthe owners or operators of the playground are not legally liable for any injuries that occur while using the equipment‚Äù. Paying $9 for a potential trip to the hospital isn‚Äôt worth it to me. They play Caribbean music and nothing else. This is a kids place they should play kid friendly music.

Pro: Unlimited playtime for $9. The play areas were clean.

Review: This place is very unsafe. The mats around the trampolines are not tied down so small children can fall through. One of the trampolines even has a hole in it so a small child's foot can go through. When climbing up the hills to the big slides, the padding does not go from wall to wall. My friends 16 month son almost fell through the cracks which untimely ended our play time early there. Also a lot of the features on the attractions were broken or blocked off, my 12 year old was pretty upset about that. I will say for the most part they keep the place pretty clean, there is a person that walks round and makes sure toys are put back and organized and cleans up after each person sits at a table to eat. My 12 month daughter loves it of course so we'll be going back but under very close supervision because as I said, the place is very unsafe. 0 safety stars.

Review: This place is great as far as taking your kids to have fun. There‚Äôs a lot of space to run around and it‚Äôs nice not having to sit out in the heat. There are tables off to the side for people to sit & eat. The kids always enjoy running around here, & it‚Äôs only $11 per child, for unlimited time, so that‚Äôs an amazing price.

The only reason this place gets 3 out of 5 stars today is because my mom ordered food. She ordered a wings combo & 2 large fries on the side. The wings combo was made very quickly, but they forgot the 2 sides of fries. When I asked about them, they said they‚Äôd be ready soon. Maybe ten minutes later, I was told it‚Äôd be another 10 minutes‚Ä¶ It took them 40 minutes to begin making the fries & the lady‚Äôs reason was that she didn‚Äôt see it because the boy who took the order wrote it too small‚Ä¶. Absolutely ridiculous.

Then to top it off, I asked the boy at the front for more napkins at some point and he literally handed me ONE.

So, great place for the kids to play, but food service is definitely not their expertise.

They have plenty of space for children to run and play even a little baby area. They are very strict regarding the no shoe policy...you must have socks to enter the play area..some minor issues but for the price I would do it again. It is also  cool for after school fun especially if you don't want to be outside.

Order two 10 piece combo, the chicken was not seasoned, grease had to need changing because wings were to dark. Only plus was the fries.Very disappointed will not return.

Review: My husband and I booked this venue for our son‚Äôs first birthday party. However, 2 weeks before the event, we visited the venue just to orient ourselves with the area and facility. Upon arrival, we were mortified by the poor maintenance of the store front (view image). We booked the venue based on the images on the website (lesson learned). We had not seen the venue in person until this day. We continued to enter the building, but with hesitation. We were pleasantly surprised by the manager‚Äôs warm welcome and she gave us facility tour. The inside looks much better than the outside, but the party rooms are dated and needs work.
After the tour, we decided to go with another venue that is better maintained in Sandy Springs. The manager provided a refund of our deposit without hesitation.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this spot to anyone who prefers an aesthetically pleasing and modern feel, but I‚Äôd recommend for a random drop-in hour of play.

Review: I wish I could give 0 stars. Don't waste your time or money. The guy at the front desk tried to sell me dirty socks, the one area where my toddler can climb the safety net had holes and the plastic zipper was poking out. Some foam mats were not placed correctly and mats were lifted up which can cause anyone to trip
My main issue was I couldn't assist my 1yo on any equipment. All she could do was climb up the little bridge because she needed help to go down the slide. They have a sign that says 13yr or older cannot use equipment
So the little slides that are near the toddler area you have the audacity to have big kids there when the big kids already have at least 4 slides to choose from. The big kids are running all in the toddler area knocking down the blocks and being wild. The toddler area should be seperated better than this, it should be gated appropriately to protect the toddlers. The music was inappropriate and filthy. I do not recommend this place. Protect your kids and go to a safer place so they can truly enjoy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE.

Review: This place is a safety hazard‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è In the 1-3 toddler section, there are metal poles sticking up from the ground that they wrapped in pool noodles(with the top exposed for a child to put their hand in). The foam mats are bulging (my child tripped over the bulge twice), and have gaps in between each other. The kitchen lights were off you couldn‚Äôt even tell it was open. When you walk in, you take your shoes off and head to the person at the desk. You write your child‚Äôs name down in their log book. There isn‚Äôt a sign displayed or an injury liability waiver you sign saying ‚Äúthe owners or operators of the playground are not legally liable for any injuries that occur while using the equipment‚Äù. Paying $9 for a potential trip to the hospital isn‚Äôt worth it to me. They play Caribbean music and nothing else. This is a kids place they should play kid friendly music.

Pro: Unlimited playtime for $9. The play areas were clean.

Review: This place is very unsafe. The mats around the trampolines are not tied down so small children can fall through. One of the trampolines even has a hole in it so a small child's foot can go through. When climbing up the hills to the big slides, the padding does not go from wall to wall. My friends 16 month son almost fell through the cracks which untimely ended our play time early there. Also a lot of the features on the attractions were broken or blocked off, my 12 year old was pretty upset about that. I will say for the most part they keep the place pretty clean, there is a person that walks round and makes sure toys are put back and organized and cleans up after each person sits at a table to eat. My 12 month daughter loves it of course so we'll be going back but under very close supervision because as I said, the place is very unsafe. 0 safety stars.

Review: This place is great as far as taking your kids to have fun. There‚Äôs a lot of space to run around and it‚Äôs nice not having to sit out in the heat. There are tables off to the side for people to sit & eat. The kids always enjoy running around here, & it‚Äôs only $11 per child, for unlimited time, so that‚Äôs an amazing price.

The only reason this place gets 3 out of 5 stars today is because my mom ordered food. She ordered a wings combo & 2 large fries on the side. The wings combo was made very quickly, but they forgot the 2 sides of fries. When I asked about them, they said they‚Äôd be ready soon. Maybe ten minutes later, I was told it‚Äôd be another 10 minutes‚Ä¶ It took them 40 minutes to begin making the fries & the lady‚Äôs reason was that she didn‚Äôt see it because the boy who took the order wrote it too small‚Ä¶. Absolutely ridiculous.

Then to top it off, I asked the boy at the front for more napkins at some point and he literally handed me ONE.

So, great place for the kids to play, but food service is definitely not their expertise.

They have plenty of space for children to run and play even a little baby area. They are very strict regarding the no shoe policy...you must have socks to enter the play area..some minor issues but for the price I would do it again.

Review: My husband and I booked this venue for our son‚Äôs first birthday party. However, 2 weeks before the event, we visited the venue just to orient ourselves with the area and facility. Upon arrival, we were mortified by the poor maintenance of the store front (view image). We booked the venue based on the images on the website (lesson learned). We had not seen the venue in person until this day. We continued to enter the building, but with hesitation. We were pleasantly surprised by the manager‚Äôs warm welcome and she gave us facility tour. The inside looks much better than the outside, but the party rooms are dated and needs work.
After the tour, we decided to go with another venue that is better maintained in Sandy Springs. The manager provided a refund of our deposit without hesitation.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this spot to anyone who prefers an aesthetically pleasing and modern feel, but I‚Äôd recommend for a random drop-in hour of play.

Review: I wish I could give 0 stars. Don't waste your time or money. The guy at the front desk tried to sell me dirty socks, the one area where my toddler can climb the safety net had holes and the plastic zipper was poking out. Some foam mats were not placed correctly and mats were lifted up which can cause anyone to trip
My main issue was I couldn't assist my 1yo on any equipment. All she could do was climb up the little bridge because she needed help to go down the slide. They have a sign that says 13yr or older cannot use equipment
So the little slides that are near the toddler area you have the audacity to have big kids there when the big kids already have at least 4 slides to choose from. The big kids are running all in the toddler area knocking down the blocks and being wild. The toddler area should be seperated better than this, it should be gated appropriately to protect the toddlers. The music was inappropriate and filthy. I do not recommend this place. Protect your kids and go to a safer place so they can truly enjoy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE.

Review: This place is a safety hazard‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è In the 1-3 toddler section, there are metal poles sticking up from the ground that they wrapped in pool noodles(with the top exposed for a child to put their hand in). The foam mats are bulging (my child tripped over the bulge twice), and have gaps in between each other. The kitchen lights were off you couldn‚Äôt even tell it was open. When you walk in, you take your shoes off and head to the person at the desk. You write your child‚Äôs name down in their log book. There isn‚Äôt a sign displayed or an injury liability waiver you sign saying ‚Äúthe owners or operators of the playground are not legally liable for any injuries that occur while using the equipment‚Äù. Paying $9 for a potential trip to the hospital isn‚Äôt worth it to me. They play Caribbean music and nothing else. This is a kids place they should play kid friendly music.

Pro: Unlimited playtime for $9. The play areas were clean.

Review: This place is very unsafe. The mats around the trampolines are not tied down so small children can fall through. One of the trampolines even has a hole in it so a small child's foot can go through. When climbing up the hills to the big slides, the padding does not go from wall to wall. My friends 16 month son almost fell through the cracks which untimely ended our play time early there. Also a lot of the features on the attractions were broken or blocked off, my 12 year old was pretty upset about that. I will say for the most part they keep the place pretty clean, there is a person that walks round and makes sure toys are put back and organized and cleans up after each person sits at a table to eat. My 12 month daughter loves it of course so we'll be going back but under very close supervision because as I said, the place is very unsafe. 0 safety stars.

Review: This place is great as far as taking your kids to have fun. There‚Äôs a lot of space to run around and it‚Äôs nice not having to sit out in the heat. There are tables off to the side for people to sit & eat. The kids always enjoy running around here, & it‚Äôs only $11 per child, for unlimited time, so that‚Äôs an amazing price.

The only reason this place gets 3 out of 5 stars today is because my mom ordered food. She ordered a wings combo & 2 large fries on the side. The wings combo was made very quickly, but they forgot the 2 sides of fries. When I asked about them, they said they‚Äôd be ready soon. Maybe ten minutes later, I was told it‚Äôd be another 10 minutes‚Ä¶ It took them 40 minutes to begin making the fries & the lady‚Äôs reason was that she didn‚Äôt see it because the boy who took the order wrote it too small‚Ä¶. Absolutely ridiculous.

Then to top it off, I asked the boy at the front for more napkins at some point and he literally handed me ONE.

So, great place for the kids to play, but food service is definitely not their expertise.

They have plenty of space for children to run and play even a little baby area. They are very strict regarding the no shoe policy...you must have socks to enter the play area..some minor issues but for the price I would do it again.

Review: My husband and I booked this venue for our son‚Äôs first birthday party. However, 2 weeks before the event, we visited the venue just to orient ourselves with the area and facility. Upon arrival, we were mortified by the poor maintenance of the store front (view image). We booked the venue based on the images on the website (lesson learned). We had not seen the venue in person until this day. We continued to enter the building, but with hesitation. We were pleasantly surprised by the manager‚Äôs warm welcome and she gave us facility tour. The inside looks much better than the outside, but the party rooms are dated and needs work.
After the tour, we decided to go with another venue that is better maintained in Sandy Springs. The manager provided a refund of our deposit without hesitation.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this spot to anyone who prefers an aesthetically pleasing and modern feel, but I‚Äôd recommend for a random drop-in hour of play.

Review: I wish I could give 0 stars. Don't waste your time or money. The guy at the front desk tried to sell me dirty socks, the one area where my toddler can climb the safety net had holes and the plastic zipper was poking out. Some foam mats were not placed correctly and mats were lifted up which can cause anyone to trip
My main issue was I couldn't assist my 1yo on any equipment. All she could do was climb up the little bridge because she needed help to go down the slide. They have a sign that says 13yr or older cannot use equipment
So the little slides that are near the toddler area you have the audacity to have big kids there when the big kids already have at least 4 slides to choose from. The big kids are running all in the toddler area knocking down the blocks and being wild. The toddler area should be seperated better than this, it should be gated appropriately to protect the toddlers. The music was inappropriate and filthy. I do not recommend this place. Protect your kids and go to a safer place so they can truly enjoy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE.

The biggest draw for me is... THERE ARE NO VIDEO GAMES. The fact that he is now so interested in indoor play and making friends is a happy development. Children 4 to12 should love it here. The babies under three or four years need very close supervision  because the baby section is cordoned off in the middle of the floor, and the older children routinely jump over the dividers and run through.}","Georgia","kidslandga.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","30236"

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly.

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

Review: This place is great for dropping off kids when you have to run some errands etc!!! It felt welcoming the moment I walked through the door. I had a sense my daughter would be safe and enjoy playing here while I took care of some things. As a single mother, I get nervous leaving my daughter but I felt extremely comfortable letting my daughter play here for a few hours. The prices were reasonable!!! The staff were helpful and nice!  They have a secure systems for drop off/pickup. I had access to cameras to see her incase I wanted to peek in on her. I definitely will utilize their services again. 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è

Review: I am so grateful that this service exists in Houston County! This is a need in this county and the owners fulfilled this need. This is a must for parents who could use a break from parenting responsibilities for a few hours. Thank you for taking such sweet care of my boy tonight while I was at a work related function. He had such a great time and he‚Äôs already ready to return. We are looking forward to using you again for all our future date nights and/or work events. I could not ask for a better service, especially when not even most daycares in the area provide live access to cameras. That alone shows the integrity that Drop n‚Äô Play provides to parents.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I wish you all the success in this niche of a business!

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly.

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

He had such a great time and he‚Äôs already ready to return. We are looking forward to using you again for all our future date nights and/or work events. I could not ask for a better service, especially when not even most daycares in the area provide live access to cameras. That alone shows the integrity that Drop n‚Äô Play provides to parents.

Review: We had the absolute BEST experience hosting our little one‚Äôs first birthday at Romp-a-Roo!

From start to finish, everything was seamless, thoughtful, and beautifully executed. Audrey went above and beyond with the d√©cor‚Äîevery single detail matched our Wonderland theme perfectly. From the balloons and backdrops to the table runners and themed play areas, it truly felt like stepping into a storybook. Even our guests (yes, including the dads!) were commenting on how detailed and magical everything was!

The space was clean, safe, and full of fun‚Äîfrom a ball pit and obstacle course to interactive play stations and an inflatable bounce area. It was a dream setup that let the kids play freely while the adults relaxed and enjoyed the party. All we had to do was show up and set out the food‚Äîeverything else was handled with care and creativity.

I cannot recommend Romp-a-Roo enough for your next party or celebration. It‚Äôs rare to find a venue that feels this personal, welcoming, and well-curated. Thank you, Audrey, for making Chloe‚Äôs ONEderland celebration so incredibly special‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to return!

Review: When this place first opened it was amazing. However the last few times we have been in the place has been dirty. The bathrooms were dirty, not stocked and needed trash taken out. The floors need a really good sweeping and mopping. The tables look like they haven‚Äôt been wiped down in weeks. Some of the bouncy toys are so filthy that I don‚Äôt even think a power wash could save them at this point. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the staff doesn‚Äôt seem to care. The person at the desk is just eating snacks and watching videos on their phone and always seems annoyed when people come in or ask questions. The way the building is designed you could easily get up and go clean and still be able to see guest walk in. It would be nice to see staff cleaning and wiping down toys periodically especially during cold season. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it‚Äôs gone down hill.

Review: Kid Zone is a hidden gem in Powell, offering a fun and safe indoor playground perfect for young children. As soon as you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted with a clean, vibrant space filled with a variety of activities for kids to enjoy. There are climbing structures, slides, and even a soft play area for toddlers, ensuring that children of all ages have something to do.

One of the best aspects of Kid Zone is how well-organized and well-maintained the facility is. You can tell that cleanliness is a priority, which gives parents peace of mind as their children explore and play. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure everyone has a good experience while keeping the environment safe.

There are seating areas for parents, and they offer beverages to purchase, so you can relax while your kids burn off some energy.

Overall, Kid Zone is a fantastic place for kids to run, and play in a controlled and fun environment. It‚Äôs a great option for birthday parties or just to get out of the house on a rainy day. Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the Powell area!

Review: Great concept! But unfortunately, it was not very clean. I wish I had read reviews before going because I now see quite a few others saying the same. There was trash in and around the play area and we were the first and only ones there so I know the trash had been there a while. The play area itself was cool, but not really for my 3 year old. He was not tall enough to climb some of the structures on his own and I was uncomfortable putting my 7 month old on the floor to help him with it being so dirty. The 3 and under area would have been great but a lot of the toys were broken and, again, just very dirty. We may come back when my kids are older, but honestly I‚Äôm not even sure about that. I can overlook a lot of things but the overall dirtiness of the entire place was frustrating. Especially since kids are climbing and crawling around. My 3 year olds socks were black on bottom when we left from how dirty it was. Unacceptable.

Review: Very cool little town area. It‚Äôs just a great concept in general. However, I will say the entire place was dirty. Stuff was under the picnic tables, clearly wasn‚Äôt slept from the night before. The play centers needed wiping down and for context, we were the FIRST ones in there when it opened. The obnoxious kidz bop was blaring at 9 am. It was freezing, at 67 degrees on the thermostat. Inside the climbing area needed to be wiped down as well. The farm animals could use a power wash, so could the mats surrounding the gym equipment. Random socks under the equipment. The wooden play screw washers for the table in the little town are huge choking hazards for 3 and under, surprisingly in the 3 and under section. If a place isn‚Äôt being cleaned down, it‚Äôs not being sanitized and kids places need sanitizing. Again, cool place, just needs improvement.

The pictures you guys have online are similar to how it looks but DEFINITELY not how it is in person.. definitely not what I expected. 3 levels of excitement are exaggerating. The building itself is pretty big but the space in the kid zone like on the pictures is false advertising. My son is 7 and literally had to squat down to walk around. Would recommend for toddlers but definitely not anything older than that.

Review: It's a nice way for my child to get exercise since it's still too cold for the outdoor playground. The place is nice enough and my child has a fun time. It's overpriced in my opinion unless you get a membership.

The only irritating part about it is that there is a little boy whose mom works behind the counter, and he can be problematic sometimes. God knows that little kids can be difficult enough without having to man the front desk while trying to keep an eye on them. That being said, my kid has been attacked by this little boy several times since we started going there and will come home with scratch marks and red skin. He also causes issues with other customers' children as well - taking their toys and being disruptive/loud.

This won't stop us from coming back indefinitely, but just something to keep in mind if you have smaller children. I won't let them play together unless I'm able to sit right next to my kid to make sure he's not being hurt.

Review: Friendly staff and a great area for kids to play freely. I went for a birthday party and the kids were busy with the play structures and the 4 play house rooms. They really kept the kids so busy parents were able to talk and relax. The play house rooms (barn, kitchen, store, garage) could fit 3 or 4 kids each and provide room for imagination to take over. The play structure had 2 or 3 levels with slides of multiple heights, the kids enjoyed the slides with 4 side by side and raced down to the bottom only to get back in line and challenge another group. Great experience and just off Clinton highway make the location convenient.

This is a place we have been needing for a while in our area. I am not sure what Rebecca Sweet from WBIR is referring to in her review about Kid Zone, (from her other reviews and how she interacts with others, it appears she is hard to please üôÑ), but when we went the area was nice, clean, and worth every minute of it. So, unless you want your children playing in a bubble and not be kids, I recommend this place (as a realistic mom)! We will be back and thank you!

Review: It's adorable, clean, and creatively designed! My kids absolutely loved the idea when we walked in! Although due to the areas being hard to experience because toys were spread everywhere and it being busier than we realized for the small space, we will probably not be back.   This place is doing great and I'm happy that there is a business like this around now it just wasn't for us.

* Also, that shelf of extras (hair ties, lotion, wipes, tampons, etc.) in the bathroom was definitely awesome!

The kids loved the play area and I loved that there was fence separating it from the 'dining' area. It was so cute with lots of things for them to do.

The cafe itself was really good, too. My son and I loved the grilled cheese and my other son loved the quesdillas. I got a strawberry acai and it was great.

We are just in town visiting my father but we will be back before we go home!

Review: I had my daughter‚Äôs birthday party here and had an amazing experience. The staff were so helpful and attentive. The decor was amazing and I am glad that I let them handle the balloon arch. I honestly didn‚Äôt need most of the extra decor that I had purchased because of how well they had already did on decorations. Everyone had a great time and highly recommend for your next birthday party. I‚Äôm not sure if there was a sign on the door that said closed for private event but there were 2 families that popped in and stood up front for quite some time during our party which was awkward for us to eventually tell them they‚Äôre not open to the public at that time so that would be my only feedback.

The caf√© offers a variety of coffees and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I do wish there were more options on the menu. The bathroom is absolutely charming and thoughtfully stocked with little details. It‚Äôs clear that the owners have spent years perfecting this concept and it is apparent. Keep up the amazing work, ladies!

The party went off without a hitch! I am so grateful. I appreciate that they offer services to cover all of the needs of a party, but that they allow you to bring your own if you prefer. We had my daughter's ""Tea for Two"" birthday and were able to use all of our own custom items and still enjoy everything that the play cafe has to offer.  I cannot recommend this enough as the perfect party spot!

Review: Very very cute place. Perfect for toddlers. My 5 year old had a lot of fun. My 7 year old was really too big, but I drug him along! Parents camp out in chairs and tables, so on a crowded day there is no room to sit. Having little lockers for parents and not allowing the keeping of chairs would be helpful for the functionality! A little pricey unless you stay for the day, but great for kids to have fun!!

Review: We LOVE visiting the Little Valley Play Cafe!    It‚Äôs a great place to cultivate your little one‚Äôs imagination and for them to socialize with their peers! You can definitely tell a lot of thought was put into every detail from the layout of the play area to the small extra touches in the bathroom! The cafe itself is also a wonderful expression of comfort. We highly recommend you have lunch sometime and try the mac and cheese! Peak times definitely seem to be in the mornings so if you would prefer a smaller crowd check them out after 12 on Tuesdays and Wednesday for extended hours till 5:30. Knoxville has waited a long time for something like this and we are excited to see this place grow!

Review: Little Valley Play Cafe has a lot of potential, I feel the space they're in very much limits that potential. I took my little one here to try it out. The front desk area is tiny making it difficult for everyone to both check-in + grab your shoes (they make you put your shoes in a small cubby at the front upon arrival) as you're trying to leave. I do love that it's gated at the entry so no kid can escape. I did not feel the staff I encountered was very friendly. I had trouble opening the gate and she didn't help but another patron did. I do not like that they don't allow you to bring in your own food. I already pay for coming there, I don't want to buy the snacks you have. I don't eat lots of the ingredients in these foods and snacks and I don't want a dessert coffee every time I go. I like the idea of the cafe, I do understand it needs to be profitable, but my family doesn't eat what they serve. Makes it hard when other indoor playgrounds we can bring food in and eat at their designated tables. I don't like that so much of the space is taken by tables and chairs for parents. A lot of parents were sitting at the stools by the wall watching their kids. And then they leave their left drinks on that wall which leaves the drinks open for little kids to come and drink from them before their parent can stop them. I also didn't like that in order to go use the restroom you have to wear your socks. I'd like to be wearing shoes when I go in a bathroom... That's gross. And then any germs from the bathroom are now on socks that are walked around in the play area. I will say that bathrooms were pretty clean when I visited which is very necessary and appreciated. The themed play stations were great, my little one loved them. I love how creative they were designing that. I did not love that a good chunk of space was taken up for a party area. I just don't see how this space was a good choice for an indoor playground. I think this place could be amazing with some improvements. Customer service is very important and employee/owner attitudes I feel set the tone overall. I look forward to watching this place improve and hopefully grow.

Review: First the helpful things to know, then I‚Äôll give you the reason for my 5-start review :)
1. Check the hours and get there early. They often have a line outside to get in and they reach capacity often.
2. Be sure that the kids and guardians wear or bring grippy socks. If you don‚Äôt have any or forget, they do sell them there for a very reasonable price.
OK, now onto the reason for my review.
I can‚Äôt say enough great things about the Little Valley Play Cafe and the staff! I went to a birthday party here and everything was magical! The staff arranged for all the decor and the food and of course provided a very clean, safe space to play. I enjoyed playing with the kids in the play areas at first. Then sat by and watched as they continued, while I sipped a delicious latte from their coffee bar. It‚Äôs so much easier to keep an eye on the kids with their open floor plan and safety gate. If you have or care for kids under 6, this place is a must. Great for birthday parties, rainy or cold days, or any day really. Whenever you go, you and the kids will be in for a real treat!

Review: Just Go!! I visited this week to check it out for the first time with my 2 kids since opening with a friend and her 2 kids. It was an absolute blast! We ended up going a second time because it was so much fun -- and not to mention the coffee was fantastic!

There was an incident that happened while we were there of no ones fault, but I watched the owner take amazing care of this sweet boy. After he was all taken care of, they offered him a Good 2 Grow Juice and he got to pick his top. He was back playing in no time. It's always great to see how much an owner cares about their patrons.

Love this place and look forward to it becoming a regular stop for us. I will say it can get busy in the late mornings/afternoons, but I love to see the success of a new business in town. If you want to visit when it's a little quieter, I recommend going in the earlier morning hours.

The owners did amazing job of thinking through things. There is so many fun sections for the kids and the quality of the cafe is top notch. A great new spot in town!

Review: This place is fantastic. The drink and food options for adults and kids are 10/10. You can tell the owners put a lot of thought and effort into everything. The little dips coming out of each playhouse could use some grippers or something since kids easily slide with their socks. Also it would be so appreciated if the person checking people in can politely say something along the lines of, ‚Äúand we just want to confirm that no one entering has a runny nose, cough, or fever today?‚Äù We can‚Äôt avoid asymptomatic people‚Ä¶ however, the last time we went, I saw a mom cover her kids mouth when they were coughing and then the same mom took a toy out of their kids mouth, wiped it on her shirt and then tossed it back on the floor. I just wish the whole ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt bring your kids if they‚Äôre sick‚Äù thing was enforced somehow. I still refuse to give this place anything less than 5 stars and still very much recommend it!

Review: This play cafe is super cute and modern. It smells clean! Kids playing in here love it and never get bored. As a former preschool teacher, I‚Äôd say the play is perfect for ages 1 (walkers) to 5 at most. I would highly recommend someone on staff to keep toys continuously organized throughout the day, so kids experience each center to its full potential. With the success of this business, I also recommend them to expand into a place much larger (small gymnasium size). Other than those things this type of business is an excellent concept. Keep being successful!

Review: There should‚Äôve been one of the staff members resetting the toys and play spaces periodically. It felt like a kids playroom that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned up in days. We sat and ate for 30 min when we arrived and the toys were never reset. My kids couldn‚Äôt really engage with the toys or spaces tripping on other toys or seeing nothing on the shelves of the little play rooms, and toys mismatched between the spaces. My kids also came down sick 48 hrs after being there. Overall just wasn‚Äôt a clean and inviting space. One positive was the food and snacks at cafe were great options and variety.

Review: Yes, I'm posting a picture of the shelf in the bathroom. Why?

Because today, when I took my toddler to play and stepped into the restroom, what I saw captured everything I'd felt since we came through the door.

At Little Valley, I truly felt that my son and I were so welcome exactly as we are. It is CLEAR that this place is run by fellow mamas; every little detail has been considered! The layout is designed so caregivers can watch their little ones while they sip delicious drinks--and by the way, those drinks are hand-delivered to you, so you don't have to take eyes off your child.

But back to the bathroom shelf. Here you see tampons, baby wipes, breath mints, dental flossers, doggy bags (iykyk), and more. They've stocked everything a mama might need to take care of herself AND her baby in there, and they've done it in a way that is more beautiful than it has to be.

I knew I was taking my baby for a treat today. I just didn't know I was giving myself one too. We can't wait to return.

Review: It has a lot of great things about it, lots of different areas for the kids to play on, lots of sensory seeking ones which is great, nice and clean. The biggest con and why I took off stars is that even babies have to pay.

Similar play places I‚Äôve seen often let babies 1 and under in free if they have a paying sibling. I paid $14 to let my barely 1 year old simply walk around and not play with any of the equipment as it‚Äôs all too big for him.

So I had to pay $30 total for my 3 year old to play for an hour and my baby to walk around freely.

If you‚Äôre a neurodivergent parent, you already have short funds with therapies and everything else you have to pay.

Not sure if we‚Äôll be back‚Äîif I can afford it, maybe.

Review: I've taken my kiddo here a few times now and every time it's been a wonderful experience. The staff have been friendly and helpful. The space is lovely and full of fun things for kids of all ages. I wanted to give a particular shout out to Trish. She was working so hard today keeping everything clean and organized. She was constantly picking up the toys in the toddler area and putting them back and keeping everything clean and organized.

Review: Today was my 2 year old son‚Äôs first visit here, and I have to say, we‚Äôve been to every play place in Knoxville, and this one is by far the best. It is spacious, clean, and designed with a strong focus on gross motor skills. We played for 2.5 hours, and my son still didn‚Äôt want to leave.

One of the things that stood out the most was the level of cleanliness. Throughout our visit, a staff member was constantly walking around, tidying and cleaning without being the least bit disruptive.

It was such a stark difference from other play places here in Knoxville where the mess can feel overwhelming and incredibly overstimulating!

Here, everything felt so well maintained and organized, making it a joy to play without stepping over clutter or navigating through chaos.

The gated play area was another huge highlight. This is the only play place we‚Äôve been to that is fully enclosed, and it gave me so much peace of mind to let my son explore freely. They also have a dedicated fully gated area for babies and toddlers, which is an absolute game changer. I so wish this place had been around when my son was a baby.

That feature alone deserves five stars in my book.

Overall, this place was incredibly clean, thoughtfully laid out, and packed with fun. We had an amazing time, and I can‚Äôt wait to come back.

Review: We Rock the Spectrum in Knoxville is an amazing indoor playground designed for all kids‚Äîneurotypical and neurodiverse alike. My 3-year-old and 7-year-old love it here, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. From the zipline to the swings, rock wall, net climb, and trampoline, there are so many opportunities for them to burn off energy while staying active. They love the craft area, where they can get creative, and the imaginative play zone with dress-up and tons of fun toys.
I wish this place had been around when my youngest was a baby because their baby/toddler area is adorable and filled with age-appropriate toys. It‚Äôs such an inclusive space that welcomes every child, making it extra special. We‚Äôve only been going for a week, and my kids are already obsessed ‚Äì we‚Äôve visited three times! I‚Äôm definitely signing up for the membership because this place is worth every penny. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a safe, fun space for their kids to play, learn, and grow.

Review: We had the absolute BEST experience hosting our little one‚Äôs first birthday at Romp-a-Roo!

From start to finish, everything was seamless, thoughtful, and beautifully executed. Audrey went above and beyond with the d√©cor‚Äîevery single detail matched our Wonderland theme perfectly. From the balloons and backdrops to the table runners and themed play areas, it truly felt like stepping into a storybook. Even our guests (yes, including the dads!) were commenting on how detailed and magical everything was!

The space was clean, safe, and full of fun‚Äîfrom a ball pit and obstacle course to interactive play stations and an inflatable bounce area. It was a dream setup that let the kids play freely while the adults relaxed and enjoyed the party. All we had to do was show up and set out the food‚Äîeverything else was handled with care and creativity.

I cannot recommend Romp-a-Roo enough for your next party or celebration. It‚Äôs rare to find a venue that feels this personal, welcoming, and well-curated. Thank you, Audrey, for making Chloe‚Äôs ONEderland celebration so incredibly special‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to return!

The set up in the main area worked perfect for the amount of guest they allow, the party price was amazing, and I loved that they gave us a checklist of expectations cleaning up, and the owner was really helpful with any questions we had leading up to and during the party. We will definitely be back to play here. My son didn‚Äôt even want to stop playing for cake so that says a lot. The only negative thing I could say is it be nice to have a broom along with the vacuum for clean up and an extra trash bag would have been helpful but overall this was an amazing experience and totally worth it.

Review: The Ark is such a fun and family friendly indoor playroom for children from infants to school age. The owners Savannah and Mac are always very welcoming, and the big boss Miss Josie is always a help with showing you around! They keep the areas clean and picked up, have tons of toys for different interests and rotate the toys from time to time to keep the children entertained and their brains moving. I visit quite frequently with the little ones I watch and refer other parents/caregivers here as well. If you are looking to beat the rain, summer heat or the cold winters or even just get out the house this is a good option. They also do events, allow birthday parties and offer play passes.  I love the ark and so do all the littles!

Review: I love when I get to bring my kids to the ARK!
I don‚Äôt live locally anymore , so I don‚Äôt get to go as often as I‚Äôd like , but I never regret it when I make the drive to meet my girlfriends and their children.
Savannah and her team have always been kind and welcoming. I see them wiping down toys and maintaining the playroom throughout our time.
I‚Äôm a photographer and it‚Äôs the perfect spot to let my kids run around in a safe space while i get work done.
I highly recommend this spot to parents who need a coffee date , a safe indoor space on rainy days to get the kiddos out, or anyone who needs a space for birthday parties etc.

The ARK is a great space and I know the owners have a good heart and a passion for their small business!

I recently had a 5yo birthday party here and the rental was extremely easy and non stressful, in fact it was probably the easiest birthday party I've done between 2 kids in the last 8 years, I highly recommend it for birthday parties. The owner is very nice and down to earth, as well as everyone she has helping. Also if you are like me and wonder if your slightly older kid would enjoy, I've witnessed older elementary kids, including my own, having a blast. This is a great addition to the community! Thanks for a great party ü•≥

Grocery store, diner, kitchen, tools, playhouse, doctor, doll house, super hero house, and little people area. There's a nice place for parents to sit and talk. It‚Äôs large enough that the kids have plenty of room to play and have fun, but small enough where you can see the kids while they play without having to follow them around or worry about them wandering off. The kids had a great time. They played for 3 whole hours and were not bored at all.

Review: We came here this morning with friends. Had a great time. The play space was perfect for my 1 and 4 year old. Lots of pretend play toys. The place was clean too. We will be back üòÅ Note: The entrance is the white door on the side. They said are working on getting a sign on the outside.

Edit on our second visit: I love this place. This is no fault to them but the smoke shop a few door down to impacting the smell in this place. I wasn't sure what it was on our first visit but I realized that it's the smoke from that place coming into this place. So if you're sensitive like me to smoke then maybe think twice. Maybe when they're lease is up here they can move to a better location. And in the meantime maybe they can get hepa air cleaners to try to reduce the odor.

Review: I have spent some time at the Ark with my niece. The space was clean and organized. There are many stations to for children to play with others or even with their adults. She asked me to play with her and together (with me sitting on the floor) she checked me out at the ‚Äúgrocery store‚Äù then prepared a meal to us to eat. It was so much fun; my niece and I both had a blast. The kids-centered space was a perfect retreat for the hot and muggy then stormy day. The Ark also had refreshments and was an overall friendly and safe space.

I ended up booking my daughter‚Äôs birthday party there for this weekend. It is hard to find an air conditioned space that is affordable in Mcdonough but the owner was so accommodating and helpful in making sure the party would work for us!

Review: Heard about this place on a  Facebook group. I tried to take my daughter to this location earlier this week. Unfortunately, when we got there, which took a while because it is kind of off the beaten path in McDonough, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with the outside of the building. It looks like an old, run-down industrial building with a hemp store right next to it (really?) There were no cars in the front, no real signage (a taped piece of printing paper with directions to a side door ), and no curtains open to the windows so that you could at least see into the place. I  called a couple of times To see if someone was inside, but the phone kept going to voicemail (at like 11 AM) I drove around to this mysterious door and did not feel comfortable taking my daughter in so I didn‚Äôt. IMO, this is not a professional place where you take your child. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable, Didn‚Äôt like the location, and wasn‚Äôt a fan of the non-responsiveness. There were also zero cars outside, which made me think the place wasn‚Äôt even open despite their hours being listed as open from 8 to 4. I got excited about having this kind of facility, but I realize this is not what I‚Äôm looking for. I won‚Äôt be back and won‚Äôt recommend it. Hopefully, we get an actual playroom in the area sometime in the future. Until then, go North. Don't waste your time here.

It is now my 2 year old daughter's favorite place to be. She can spend hours playing independently, or play alongside other kiddos there. Just today, we brought our breakfast to eat at the playroom, and then she played for a few hours before I had to pull her away. We have been many times, and she never tires of it. It is clean, age appropriate,  and a perfect place to relax while your little ones play. Love that they have an area for nursing mamas too.

Also, unfortunately, the girl working the desk was not friendly or helpful. Birthday parties here are super cute, but again, the price point is out of reach for most people, and they don't allow much time in the party room. Unless we are attending a party, we will not be going back. I have spoken with quite a few others who feel the same way.

Review: I cannot recommend this place enough. My husband and I are excited to utilize a membership, and bring our daughter here for the events and work/play time with us. Whoever created this unique business venture is a genius. It‚Äôs a clean, organized play area that promotes calmness and excitement through the aesthetics and play areas offered. There are comfortable places for adults and infants, while still giving toddlers and young kids ample space to play. Offering well made toys for the children to play and learn with, then displaying those same toys in the shop for parents to purchase and take home is genius. Our daughter picked a toy in the play area, utilized it well and showed significant interest, and we were able to purchase it and bring it home. The staff member, Ellie, was professional and warm with her greeting and giving us a tour of the building and explaining the background of the owner and the company and answering any and all questions we had. Being a veteran we have lived in several cities and states and this is by far the most creative and beneficial ‚Äúindoor play place‚Äù that we have ever encountered. Don‚Äôt hesitate to take your family.

Edit*****
It has now been about 4 months since our first visit. We have utilized the membership opportunity and definitely go about 2-3x a week. The staff have become wonderful friends and our daughter is becoming friends with other members children. We take advantage of the Tuesday music therapy classes and the family events.

Downside: Pricey.  You have to pay to watch your child play. (7.50)
It's $15 per child which is way over priced.  Lowering prices would be more accommodating for families of 3 or more.    Membership price's are over $200 /per year for just one child. Please lower your prices for us families with 3 or more kids! And us SAHM too.

Review: Carilly is truly one of the best services I've ever used. I've been using it for three years now and have had nothing but positive experiences. Recently, I found myself in a bind with a one-week gap in childcare. In a rush, I went to book with Carilly and noticed an option for Little Lake Play. I'd heard of it before but didn't know how it worked.

It turns out it's incredibly simple: you book a babysitter through Carilly, select the Little Lake Play option, and drop your child off during the scheduled time‚Äîno need to call ahead or notify Little Lake. It's super convenient and provides some much-needed quiet time to work.

But there's something even better! They offer a 'Mom‚Äôs Morning Out,' which is drop-in care available on Monday, Thursday, or Friday from 9 am to 12:30 pm for just $38. It‚Äôs an unbeatable deal. My daughter absolutely loved it and kept asking all week when she could go back. She even told me her favorite teacher EVER  was the young girl with curly hair and medium toned skin. Honestly, all of them were smiling and sweet. The kids there are of all ages and super sweet. My daughter loves going, and it‚Äôs truly a hidden gem. Thank you for offering a space like this. It truly helped me out and I felt great sending my daughter knowing how happy she was.

Review: Update 2 years later.
While we absolutely love this place for kiddos things are sometimes wonky. Pricing always seems to change. We just walked out after being told parents have to purchase a ticket if there‚Äôs an extra parent even though we‚Äôve been multiple times in the past and never had to. Last time we were in they had mentioned pricing changed to just the children need tickets. I guess this time it‚Äôs changed back? Wish they could be more consistent with pricing instead of it depends who is at the front desk. Consistency would be great. I also feel like this play area is targeted towards younger kids or littles but very often are there big kids that run and takeover situations making it overwhelming due to size and space. Great place but feels like some kinks need to be worked out.

You get what you pay for and Little Lake is a 10/10.

Review: Little Lake Play is the cutest! Super accommodating for all ages, boys & girls, and a cool little place for the parents to sit while the kids play. It is so clean and they don‚Äôt allow anyone‚Äôs shoes on the play area which is amaaazing.

We‚Äôve attended a birthday party and it‚Äôs absolutely adorable and reasonably priced.

You don‚Äôt have to think twice if you‚Äôre considering a place to take your little babes!

Review: A great place for your little precious to have a good time in an air conditioned environment. Suitable for very little babies, perfect for the kids who just started realising there is a world out there up to the time when they can start meddling with the big kids. The host is awesome, she engages with all children and teaches them good manners in a very friendly and respectful way. You can stay there all day if you wish. Don‚Äôt forget to bring socks!

What I really appreciated was how affordable it was. It‚Äôs a great, low-cost way to spend a few hours and keep a kid entertained without spending a ton. Everything was super clean and well-maintained, and the staff was really friendly too.

The whole setup is just so cool. There are lots of different play areas and little details that kept my nephew engaged the entire time. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon. Highly recommend if you're looking for something fun to do with little ones in the Lakeland area!

Review: This is a hidden gem! I have been wanting to come here with my two children, who have ADHD & different levels of Autism, my son, who is 11, and my daughter, who just turned 6, since they opened. We never had a chance to visit until yesterday (Saturday, June 28, 2025) when we were invited with some friends who are members. My oldest had a blast with the arcade games, the climbing areas, and just being indoors in general in a safe environment to help escape this heat. The facility is card only, which was no issue for us, thankfully. The machine to dispense the game card even took tap to pay, so my son was able to use some Apple Cash he had to load a new game card.

Francine was very helpful when checking in with explaining the waiver, the process since it was our first time, and swatting any of those pesky flies that snuck through the door. They didn't get far because Francine was on it in the lobby, swatting left and right, taking out those summer nuances. Liz with the killer nails (can't wait to see what design she has on our next visit) helped when we needed to check out from the snack bar, which I was very impressed with the selections that are offered. She is very personable and a great asset to the front desk. Kyrsten knew exactly what I needed on this 100 degree day when I ordered a fountain Sundrop because she came in clutch, offering extra ice! I was like, Yessssss please! I was praising the facility already, and they told me where to leave the review, so here I am!

Plum Krazy Play is now a staple in our neurodivergent family! Not only because it is a safe place I can let my children play inside with added sensory play when needed, I can get a fountain Sundrop, AND I can get some adult interactions in.... I say sign me up! We are discussing membership as a family and looking at all the calendar events, including Sensory Wednesday, which is probably going to be the first time I bring my daughter. Can't wait to come again!

As an added bonus, the facility is a Pok√©mon Gym if anyone plays Pok√©mon Go ;)

Being the mother to a three year old, I am an Indoor Playground connoisseur. They‚Äôre all similar, you know? But this place is different because the people who work there truly love and enjoy children. We played for a few hours and left. Unfortunately for me, I didn‚Äôt realize I was locked out of my car. The wonderful woman who worked there‚ÄîFrancine‚Äîhelped me contact the non-emergency police line and entertained my little guy with tap dance moves and lemonade. She made him feel like a million bucks and I could tell she genuinely loved him and was interested in what he had to say. She even let him help behind the counter for a sec while I got my car unlocked. Amazing staff, amazing place! Highly recommend!

Review: We love Plum Krazy Play! Such a nice indoor play place for kids of all ages! There is a nice little section for kids under 3, so they are sectioned off and can play freely in their own area while it still being open for parents to see bigger kids play as well! We have been to several birthday parties here as well, and it is always a crowd pleaser! The characters are welcoming and interactive and the kids love it! All of the staff is super friendly and attentive! We always have a great time here! I also had a question for management and they handled in such a friendly way. Let this be your sign to take your kids for a fun play date!!

Review: Recently had a birthday party here and was left a little disappointed with the price factor and what we received. Each child was supposed to get a bag of chips and capri-sun and none were provided, we had dropped decorations off two hours prior to our party and they were being set up as our party was on going through out the night to the point not all was even used, had ordered water pitchers during the booking and those were not even provided either‚Ä¶ I feel like for the price point of paying over $300 it would have been a bit more put together. Nonetheless, communication with any questions I had was always super fast. The staff was friendly and my kids did have a great time playing.

The owners Franco & Noel worked hard to pull off the best and most memorable birthday party for our daughter. Franco, Noel & their staff were so nice, attentive throughout the whole party. They set up decorations, helped with providing food to all the attendees, cleaned up afterwards, etc. As a mom, it‚Äôs so nice not to have to worry about the small things and enjoy the party. I would recommend Plum Krazy Play to everyone!! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!

Definitely worth it! The kids didn‚Äôt really sit down long enough to eat anything because they were having SO much fun running around.

Review: ‚≠ê 1 out of 5 stars

We visited this indoor playground recently, and unfortunately, it was a very disappointing and concerning experience. The facility was noticeably dirty ‚Äî floors, equipment, and play areas all felt poorly maintained. To make matters worse, staff were mostly standing around, not engaging with kids or actively monitoring the space.

A major red flag: we found a vape on the ground inside the children‚Äôs play area. This is completely unacceptable in a space meant to be safe for young kids.

But the most upsetting part is that a few days after our visit, my daughter developed hand, foot, and mouth disease. She‚Äôs not in daycare and hasn‚Äôt been around any other children recently, so we‚Äôre confident this is where it came from. Illnesses happen, but in this case, it really feels like a direct result of a lack of proper sanitation and oversight.

This place has potential, but until they make serious improvements to cleanliness and safety standards ‚Äî and actually supervise the space ‚Äî we won‚Äôt be back.

Review: A great place for all ages. We celebrated my daughter's birthday who turned one year old. While I appreciate the inclusions for the birthday party package ( drinks, fruit snack, bring your own food, 3 hr party, etc) I have some feedback/concerns:
1. Each child at the party is given ""flames"" for games and ride but they put EVERYONE'S flames on one card. A savings for the company but an inconvenience for the host and guest.
2. ""Unlimited"" drinks are 2 liters but they provide small cups. So bring your own. Another savings for the company but an inconvenience for the host and guest. Individual cans/bottles would be preferred. Especially for the water, instead of 1 gal bottle.
3.  Several older kids kept coming into the toddler area. They were fully staffed, most of them positioned behind the counter. Only one birthday party in session (mine) but no employees even attempted to regulate the toddler area.
4. I booked the morning party time (10:30am) with hopes to have first access to a clean toddler area. It was very noticeable that the surfaces/floor was not clean. Therefore in my opinion the cleanliness of the ball pit is questionable. I would have rated this place at least a 4 but had to deduct another star due to cleanliness. Cleanliness and safety should be their priority especially if they are providing a service for children.

However, the staff was friendly. Music selection was enjoyable. Thank you Bryant and Christie. They let me use an extra table for my party. Bryant was always checking on us.

Review: It was my first time coming here with my niece and my nephew who are 8 and 5 years old. It was a wonderful time from start to finish. All of the staff were so kind and helpful! The play area is a great size; not too big to lose track of your kids but not too small that they get bored fast. Lots of other kids, too, so my niece and nephew had a ton of fun socializing. The food and drinks were well-priced and the games were easy to win including the claw games. We‚Äôve been here for about 2 hours and the kids are tiring out. Well worth the time and money! Wonderful place! We will be back!

Also, a big thank you to the staff who helped my husband locate his misplaced phone. It wasn't their responsibility to help, but they went above and beyond, searching every station. Fortunately, he found it, and the staff even called to ensure he had it back. Thank you, Adventure Town staff!

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

Review: Honestly, I didn‚Äôt like it at all. I had to wait 40 minutes to get in (even though the place was pretty empty) because they only allow entry every 2 hours. On top of waiting, I had to pay $12 per child just because the tables are located in the play area. I ended up eating in the waiting room. The food was terrible‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt even finish it. Everything was wrapped in plastic like it had been sitting there for days, NOTHING freshly made. The price was high compared to the quality. I was truly disappointed with the place. It also looked dirty and run-down; it lacked care and attention. When I walked in, I wasn‚Äôt even sure if it was a store or a caf√©. I won‚Äôt be coming back!
It was so bad I‚Äôm now on my way to find another place.

Review: Edit: They put the layout back and it's so much better! Sitting out of the way of the kids is great. The adults can watch the kids and still have a conversation now. Changing my review back to 5 stars where it belongs ‚ù§Ô∏è

We used to go to Glow Worm with our 2 year old all the time and it was great, but since they have changed the layout it feels completely different.

The tables used to be all on one side and all the fun stuff was within view of parents sitting and enjoying the delicious coffee and baked goods they serve there.

Now everything is scattered and feels disjointed and disorganized. Parents who are meeting other parents can't sit and watch their kids play because they can only see small portions of the play space at a time and you lose where your kid is. Everywhere you stand to watch and play with your kids you feel like you're in the way, both of the children playing and the other parents trying to do the same thing.

I'm not sure why anyone thought it was a good idea to arrange the space this way, and I can't believe how negatively it has affected the entire experience.

If they go back to the old layout, this review would be 5 stars, as the staff, food, coffee, restrooms, toys, etc are all amazing.

Side note: the Santa that they had come take pictures with the kids recently was top-notch!

Their iced coffee was fantastic and our kids loved that they served mini muffins. I also really liked browsing their clothing - so many cute items! The play space kept our 1, 3, and 5 year old busy for the entire reservation time! Will definitely be back next time we're in the area.

Review: No one is enforcing any safety in this place. There is a baby gate set up to keep kiddos in the play areas, but parents would leave it wide open and I watched so many kids wander out with no guardian. Kids climbing up the slide and tackling each other. All things that are definitely just kiddo things, but if parents don't enforce safety for their own kids and others, the staff really should.

Plus there were ants on the floor, flooring not fully covering the space (could literally peel it up around the edges) and too many children in the small space all at once.

Review: I‚Äôve taken my little one there a few times and while it is a great place, it doesn‚Äôt seem safe for those who aren‚Äôt walking just yet. The time before last, there were children much older than 2 in the 2 and under area, and our little one was almost knocked over several times.

Today, as we were checking in, there were children probably 4-5 years old in the 2 and under area running wild. I asked the staff if it could be addressed so our baby could safely play. Something was said, but those kids came back in later and nothing was said again. We ended up leaving after one of these older children was far too rough.

We will probably wait to return until it feels like a safer time for our little one at a later age.

Edit: The owner and I have had great communication about my previous review and she was kind enough to email me today after we attended a Bluey play session to check in!

Review: We were able to visit today for the first time. We had the BEST time. I am new to being a mom of 2 so I get really overwhelmed and anxious sometimes taking a 5 month old & 3 1/2 old out in public alone, but Glow Worm Cafe & Play is so accommodating for parents, toddlers & babies. There is a comfy area to breastfeed and the play area is completely visible so you are still able to watch your child at the same time. Forgot diapers? No worries...They had some stocked in the bathroom.  The owner really took the time to think of anything and everything that could make your time there comfortable and fun. My toddler loved every bit of the play area. I'm going to book an event for his birthday in October. We will be back!

Review: Glow Worm Play Caf√© is a gem for parents and little ones! The Montessori-inspired play area is thoughtfully designed, providing a safe, engaging space for kids to explore while parents can actually relax. The coffee is top-notch, and the pastries are a delicious bonus. Highly recommend for a fun and stress-free outing!

Review: This place is a great indoor playground for kiddos! It has helped socialize our 2 year old in a safe and fun environment. The coffee is delicious and the little bakery makes great pastries and little breakfast sandwiches that are also reasonably priced! It's worth the 12ish dollars it costs to take your little one. You can engage with them in play but, also choose to take a breath and enjoy a hot coffee while they figure out how to engage with other littles as it's easy to keep eyes on them.

Review: The play cafe has been a game changer for our daughter. She is a busy bee and usually loves to go on walks or a playground in the mornings, but winter is always a difficult time for us. We signed up for the play cafe membership and take her most mornings now. She loves it so much! There‚Äôs always something fun to do and she‚Äôs free to roam and play as she pleases. Truly one of the best things we‚Äôve ever spent money on. And super affordable! One of her new favorite spots is a little dollhouse set up that they can climb and play in.

Review: It was an alright place, but other factors made it underwhelming . Many kids not being watched, even parents sitting outside the play area, so it wasn‚Äôt too safe as the older kids would be a little too aggressive (pushing and yanking) with my 2yo.
The food was good, but I found a hair in my grilled cheese and when I told the girl working the cash register, she said ‚Äú oh sorry, do you want another one?‚Äù I did decline, because i didnt want more hair in the sandwich (it was her hair) and i wasnt offered another solution so overall it was a little of an underwhelming experience.

Review: I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with just how much we love this place!! We‚Äôve brought our son here since he was around 6 months old (now 2 years old), and since we‚Äôve enjoyed it so much that we have a membership. Some of our favorite memories have been sweet moments in glow worm with our son and friends we have made.

When our son was younger we really enjoyed the area sectioned off for the younger babies. The area for littles is always filled with age-appropriate toys and even some soft play climbing, as well as a mini jungle gym for small toddlers. The half walls that enclose the area allowed for our son to see out into the ‚Äòbig kids‚Äô area, which also was engaging for him as well. While many of the toys ended up in our sons mouth, I also greatly appreciated the system they have in place that allows for the entire playroom to be cleaned between play sessions, which you definitely don‚Äôt see at other kid-centered play spaces!

While it‚Äôs nice having a designated area just for the little ones, it‚Äôs also wonderful that much of the entire play space is also friendly for both the babies, toddlers, and kids alike (and parents too). The owner is frequently adding new fun items, as well as changing the layout of the room which makes the space even better for guests that go often. There‚Äôs everything from Montessori pretend  play, to indoor jungle gyms with soft padded landings, to stem like toys and everything in between. One of the coolest things about glowworm has to be the variety of toys they have there, and how it truly seems like there‚Äôs a toy(s) for every kind of child and play. We sometimes have one of our son‚Äôs autistic cousins come with us for play dates, and they even have sensory-friendly spaces, toys, and accessories (like special ear mufflers for children with noise difficulties) that allows her to also enjoy a play space that she otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be able to. All of the toys and nugget couch setups make it hard for parents to not also find themselves playing with some of the things that are on the floor.

And last but certainly not least, glow worm is more than just a play space for children. They also have a cafe that has delicious snacks and beverages, as well as a small section of retail that always has high quality clothes/children items for reasonable prices! My husband jokes that every time I come I ‚Äúhave to buy something,‚Äù and he‚Äôs usually not wrong seeing as how wonderful many of the items are! I‚Äôve gotten some of my favorite sleepers, holiday sweaters, and other various things from the little retail section they have in the entrance. The staff members there are always so friendly, and the owner is often there and is a WONDERFUL human that I‚Äôve been excited to finally meet and get to know better. Glowing worm overall is a genuinely good place for kids, is a haven for parents that need a safe space for their kids to play, and is a small-business within the community that is ran by good humans. I promise you won‚Äôt regret checking it out if you haven‚Äôt already, this place is truly that great.

Review: Today was our first visit to this incredible children‚Äôs indoor play space with our 19-month-old, and I cannot recommend it highly enough for parents with young kids! From start to finish, everything was fantastic.

We booked an afternoon session online the night before, and I found the pricing to be very reasonable for the full two hours we were able to stay and play. The policy of allowing two parents per child is a great touch, and the experience was worth every penny.

Right from the entrance, the space was welcoming. There‚Äôs an adorable little shop with the cutest clothing and a cozy coffee shop setup. We enjoyed a smoothie and a turkey panini, both of which were spot on. The play area itself was a dream come true for our little one. There were around 15‚Äì20 kids during our session, which felt lively but never overwhelming. My husband and I could relax in comfortable chairs in the play area, enjoying our snack while keeping an eye on our kiddo. We were also able to join in whenever we wanted.

The equipment was spotless, and I was particularly impressed with the wide range of activities available, from wooden toys to sensory play that really engaged our toddler. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of thought and care went into creating a safe, fun, and enriching environment for kids.

During our session, I couldn‚Äôt help but text a couple of mom friends to share this hidden gem. We‚Äôre already planning future playdates here! I can‚Äôt thank the staff and the owner enough for providing such an affordable, enjoyable, and thoughtfully curated activity for families. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and play again soon!

Highly, highly recommend!

Review: It‚Äôs just one big room. Some parents don‚Äôt watch their kids. A little girl let the shopping cart slide down the slide which is basically aimed at the littles area. I messed up my reservation and was told when I canceled I would have a credit. But, I guess I didn‚Äôt make an account so there‚Äôs no record. There‚Äôs a lot of toys to play with, I just wasn‚Äôt impressed with the atmosphere or set up.

PS The second picture was added after the comment about there not being a shopping cart in the room.  The picture has the shopping cart in question in the picture. Maybe I‚Äôm not calling it the correct name but it looks like a shopping cart, it has four wheels, is wooden, and easily slides down the slide.

Review: Glow Worm is one of my 3.5 year old's favorite places to visit. He constantly wants to go to ""the play cafe"" for treats and play time and I have to patiently explain when he asks last minute that we have to make a reservation. My almost 2 year old loves it just as much as is always trying to keep up with the big kids. All the toys are safe for him, as long as he is watched when climbing. The bigger kids tend to be very loving with him as well, which of course isn't GW's job to supervise but great that it sets that kind of tone and environment. I do appreciate that the riding toys and things with wheels are no longer in the main play area -- they seemed to create fights and injuries with the bigger kids. I love that they pay attention to and acclimate to the needs and safety of their clients constantly!

Review: If you have little ones up to age six, Glow Worm Cafe & Play has always been one of our favorite places to visit. I discovered this place when I was new mom with a tiny eight week old, trying to find things to keep us occupied during a time that was very chaotic. I would go to a mom‚Äôs group that was held there, and I remember I couldn‚Äôt wait till my daughter was big old enough to play because it was the coolest place ever. When she was about six or seven months old, they offered a little play session for littles and we did that. She loved it, she would crawl around, and it was fun. Shortly after her first birthday, we began playing at the baby area in the Highlands location and she was obsessed. My tiny girl discovered a love for slides and play kitchens, and it was so cool watching her confidence grow as she explored the bigger area and the big kid slide!! We alternate locations, and the Beechmont location, it‚Äôs smaller so it‚Äôs really amazing watching her play on her own (something we are still working on!) and figuring out how to climb the steps to the slide, or pushing balls on the ball wall.  We love both locations and can‚Äôt wait for the new one! Katie has created such an amazing place and it‚Äôs so inspiring watching it grow! The staff has always been so friendly and the food is amazing (especially the everything bagel scone and the turkey sandwich!). We really love going to Glow Worm and I‚Äôm so grateful we found it. I truly feel like it is such a gem and recommend it to everyone! Also I highly recommend Cocoon. They offer weekly meetings for babies, newborn to thirteen months, and toddlers, thirteen months to I believe thirty-six months and it‚Äôs such a godsend. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it!

The bakery/cafe/retail area when you first walk in is delightful ‚Äî I ordered a chai latte and my daughter got some chocolate chip mini muffins, which they bring to you in the play area. The play area was very thoughtfully designed and so clean! I sat at a table and worked on an upcoming presentation while both children played.

Review: We have been here multiple times since this has opened. The staff is always nice, the desserts are yummy (pumpkin crumb cake specifically), and the drinks are good. I love being able to be in a coffee shop while my kids can play.

However, there is just not a lot for kids to do. We were one of the first ones in today and the shelves are bare, the play restaurant is empty, and the train table has very little to go on it. I have a three year old and I really thing she has outgrown this (it‚Äôs meant for five and under). There is soooo much potential here. There could be more sensory things, doll houses, a better play kitchen, more food, and things to build. My friends have all lost interest in going because it‚Äôs just not appealing anymore. I know toys get lost and things probably get taken but it has been like this for awhile. And I‚Äôm not here to hate on a local business. I want it to thrive and I want to support local but I think it needs a revamp in the toy department.

Parents can sit back and watch their littles play while recharging themselves. My son had a blast. We will definitely be back!

Review: This is one of those places where you visit as a parent and think ‚Äòoh my gosh, why didn‚Äôt I think of this‚Äô or 'why aren‚Äôt there more'. Glow Worm or ‚Äòsprinkle muffin place‚Äô as my kids call it, is GENIUS!! Such a wonderful refuge to let the kids play safely while parents can have some peace to sit and enjoy their coffee/pastries and work/book/conversations etc.

Service is always top notch, I have no idea how they keep it so clean and it‚Äôs adorable all around. We also hosted my 4 year olds birthday party here and the owner/staff went above and beyond to make the day what it was including the in house cake we ordered. We have not tried the ‚Äòlate' night sessions yet but again, GENIUS. It seems to be booking up further out than previously so word to the wise, keep up with their social media/booking site but you won‚Äôt be disappointed!

They have 4 rooms for parties that seem to be a good size and a large area at the front with a lot of tables for both kids and adults to use. Tons of climbing areas, a ball pit, trampolines etc for kids to choose from. My daughter loves the carousel swing while my son's favorite is the trampoline area. There are a couple spots with big screen tvs that play kid-safe/friendly shows too. It's a great place for them to burn energy and have fun for a couple hours.

Review: Very clean playgym with a ton of fun equipment. However, it has issues. First of all the food/kitchen menu is basically fake. In theory, they serve both coffee and hot food, but in reality, there's never actually staff to prepare it. I've been here 10+ times. Just don't expect any food except packaged snacks.

Secondly, why is there a huge movie screen playing cartoons??? Who thought this was a good idea at a playgym? If I wanted my toddler to sit and watch Disney movies, we do that at home for free.

Too bad for these poor management decisions. High Five could be great! But right now there is zero reason to visit when you can drive 10m down Independence & go to Playland instead.

Review: Hosted a party here for my son and the kids had a blast. They do, however, need to work on logistics. We arrived 30 minutes before start time and they said we needed to wait until 15-20 minutes prior‚Äîno problem. The email stated we‚Äôd have a room attendant which we did not have. No grip socks included for my party guests. The food came and no one announced or told us it was there so by the time the kids got to it‚Äîit was cooling off. The same happened with their sweet treats at the end. No announcement, no notifying the parents‚Äîjust dropped it off to melt and walked off. The only time someone came and communicated directly with me was at the end when they wanted me to check out and pay them. For the prices they charge they should be way more accommodating to families hosting parties. If you‚Äôre going just for kids to play 6 and under it‚Äôs a good option with accessibility for the smaller kids. I‚Äôve hosted multiple kids parties and this was the least impressive experience on that front.

Review: Great spot for kids! We went recently for a 2 yr olds birthday party and everyone has a good time. There's something to do for kids of pretty much all ages... my 18 month old enjoyed herself just as much of my 9 year old. It can be a little chaotic as kids can run around independently while parents can choose to watch from the sidelines. So you just have to be extra watchful of the smaller kids to make sure the bigger ones dont run them over. The location would have been hard to find of the party host didnt specifically tell everyone it was behind the At Home store, because if you simply type the address in the GPS you would end up at the front door of the At Home store. Overall it was a great time, I would visit again!

Review: It‚Äôs a very spacious clean and fun playground with beautiful displays. However when you book a party (which is very expensive)they expect you and all your guests to be out of the entire facility in the two hour window. They also failed to put the correct amount of chairs knowing the number of guests that had signed in about an hour prior to seat for pizza and cake. The number of chairs was not updated in time. One of my guests felt left out because they took a long time to bring the chair and the little one stepped out crying. It was not a fun experience for my guest and I‚Äôm very unhappy about that.

Review: Not worth the money üëéüèª biased because I‚Äôve been to other indoor playgrounds, and this was most definitely at the bottom of my list. Parents aren‚Äôt allowed to go down the beautiful big slide they have and that really threw me for a loop since my child wanted to go down together. There was also paper signs multiple places saying that adults couldn‚Äôt go on or use areas as well as other paper signs to not lean on furniture etc. This just tells me you bought cheap furniture but charge an expensive price to get through the door. Not to mention, the cafe was not stocked with any food or snacks in the cases and when asked for a cup of coffee well over an hour before their closing time, we had been told the machine was already shut down for the day. They only offer 2 hour passes and within 30 minutes of not being able to join my toddler on things, we were ready to go but stayed since we had already paid for it. I‚Äôm sure people enjoy it here but in my opinion, spend your money elsewhere. The place was also clean, which was nice. The gate at the front had been left open a couple times and had to keep redirecting my toddler to not run away.

Review: We really enjoyed this place. My children are 1 year and 4 years old. Both kids had a great time. The playground was built in such a way that I could always visually make sure that everything was fine with my eldest and that she was having a great time, while I stayed close to my youngest daughter the whole time. Clean, beautiful, lots of fun for children. For two children it turned out to be about $35 for 2 hours, which is above average, but the day was cloudy, and most importantly the daughters had a great time.

You can book your time online, but it is not necessary. The first time I booked, the subsequent ones came simply when they wanted to play. But in the second case, it is worth considering that if the site is overcrowded, you may be refused, which has never happened to us.

Review: Came to High five for an afternoon play date. We had a blast! We went around 4PM on a Friday. Everything was clean. Even made me more excited to see people actively cleaning as we were playing. The only reason I took off one star is because the price is a bit steep for a 2 hour playtime. I only brought one of my two kids but I can‚Äôt imagine a family paying for more than 2 kids. This place is definitely geared to kids 10 and under. They have little baby sections for little ones to play on. Socks are required which is great! Hand sanitizer stations posted everywhere and lots of spaces for parents to sit out and chill. Even a place for parents who need to charge their phones, use their computers, or even moms to plug up to pump. They also have a cafe that serves food. We were going out to eat afterwards so we didn‚Äôt get to use those services. It overall we enjoyed and though the price is higher than others, we will be back!

Review: The establishment is clean, and maintained well, it was not very busy today which was nice,   Removed stars for not having any saftey measures for kids leaving with correct adults and the gate to the exit was not consistently shut either and the front door wouldn‚Äôt completely shut either   ‚Ä¶ when we got here it was so hot inside everyone was sweating even people sitting down- I personally bumped the ac to a comfortable level bc no employees were‚Ä¶ overpriced, (15 min down the road I can pay half of what I pay for 1 here )-  the food options are not healthy at all,   And there are tvs in multiple spots ‚Ä¶.  Which for some would be a  non issue but for people bringing kids who are screen free the kids just stare at the tv and video game tv  in the ball pit and barely play with the eqpt we overpaid for.  ‚Ä¶. Not allowed to go down the slide with the toddler. Means  we now have to keep redirecting away from the slide and this one loves slides. The ‚Äúlittle‚Äù slides are great for 6-9 month olds, but not 2 year olds.  the spinning car thing has broken pedals  it was not a horrible time, but it def could be better

It‚Äôs a little hard to find at first since it is behind the home store.

Review: How does this place not have all 5 stars?! It is perfect! It was VERY big, had a ton of seating and was super clean. The birthday rooms were the best I've ever seen! My kids had a great time here! I've been to a lot of these and this was by far the nicest, cleanest, cutest place. You pay a little more because the quality is truly outstanding! We will absolutely be back!

Review: This place takes the cake for toddler entertainment. A spacious play area layout with many play opportunities. My daughter and her cousin had a blast, will definetly be returning. My wife and I are already considering this place for the upcoming birthday. 10/10 recommend.

The staff is also very friendly and patient. You will also see them actively cleaning equipment and placing the playpen balls back in when they are loose on the floor. You can really tell they are taking great effort to provide a good experience.

Review: My kids and I really enjoyed this play space, it seemed very clean and there were lots of different things for them to do. My biggest concern and reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the video game featured in the ball put area...one of the games has characters holding guns and that certainly isn't age appropriate.

Everything feels thought out from the low bathroom toilets to the mini chair and tables where kids can take a break to have a snack.

Review: We usually go to Playland but came here with our friends a few weeks ago instead since it's closer to our home. With a 4 year old, for a few dollars more than Playland, she had a fantastic time. Absolutely loved all the play equipment. It felt pretty clean, was very spacious, had more things that parents could sit on closer to the kids if they needed help, and truly it was worth the extra dollar or two above Playland to not have to drive all the way down there.
However, the one negative thing I would say is that there's absolutely no security measures for the children or parents. There's no name tags to double check and make sure you're bringing your child out with you or someone else's kid. I felt very concerned the entire time that I had to keep a lookout near the door and make sure no creeps had come in.
Would really appreciate it if you guys have a name system and check on the tags before the parents and children leave. Playland does that.

Review: I‚Äôve visited High-five Playhouse twice now and my son and I really enjoy it. My son recently had a birthday party there last weekend and we had overall a good experience but I do wish our party host told us to leave in a kinder manner. Our party was over at 12 and we were out of the play area by 12:15. The party room was completely empty by 12 pm. We were on the side where the chairs were by 12:15 gathering last minute things but by 12:20 our party host came to me and told us we had to leave now and was very rude about it. I understand that we were still in the building 20 mins after party time but we were not in the party room or play area whatsoever.. just on the side gathering things and putting kids shoes on. I would understand more if the facility was busier or if we were in anyone‚Äôs way but like I mentioned, our party room was empty and the next party hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. At 12:20 the building alone wasn‚Äôt even as busy as it was 30 mins prior. I‚Äôm really big on customer service and I wish our birthday party experience didn't end that way. I also wish they wouldn‚Äôt tell us to start packing up 15 mins before our party time ends which cuts us short of our 2hours that we have booked. I wish they had longer slots in between parties to avoid people from feeling rushed to leave.

Review: Brand new indoor playhouse! Place is very clean and the staff are seen constantly cleaning up around the kids, ensuring the balls stay in the pits and the building blocks stay in their designated areas. Drinks and pizza wasn't too high. Came at 3pm on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. Friendly staff. My only suggestion is to invest in some additional signage to help assist parents find your location.

Review: First experience wasn‚Äôt great. I love the abundance of space and play equipment but I do have a few concerns I hope can be resolved. The staff was friendly but I never saw her get up to clean anything while we were there, she was sitting on her cell phone our entire stay. There was debris on the ground and unclean areas behind some play equipment in harder to reach areas. Most concerning is a pole that has been left exposed. There was a kid there who hurt his head after bumping into it while playing and the staff member didn‚Äôt seem concerned. There was no report taken, nor general feeling of care for what happened, or any investigation into how the child hurt himself. I hope at minimum the pole can be covered to protect other children.

There was a very aggressive child that multiple times sought out my 14 month old and hit her hard enough to land her flat on her back or face. Staff did nothing. When I said something to the mother and she began screaming at me in the middle of the play station staff again did nothing. I spoke with one of the owners Olivia who told me they have no policies for this behavior and that it isn‚Äôt their job to do anything. I do not feel it is a safe place to bring my children anymore.

I've been taking my little one since before a year and there is space for early walkers to practice their stuff without fear of being underfoot of older children.

The place itself uses its small space very well, with well thought actitives that change periodically.  My 2 and 4 year old sons have a blast.  It's alos quite clean.

Definitely best for preschoolers, but my 8yo enjoyed doing a coloring page and spending time with the magnet tiles before we played Uno while his little brothers (5yo and 2yo) played. Snacks and drinks are reasonably priced (even better, outside food/drink is welcome) and admission is the best around.

Review: I have twin 9 month olds and a 2.5 year old, and all of us have had such a blast at The Play Station. I feel like I could confidently go solo-parenting with all 3, which is saying something ;) For us it‚Äôs the perfect size, well child-proofed in terms of safety/escaping out the door, and the babies love crawling around and exploring. Living in Milan it‚Äôs a huge blessing to have a place to go in a pinch if we need to get out of the house between naps times üòÜ

Review: Milan was sorely missing something like this and it's done so well now that we have it! Had our son's 4th birthday here and it was an absolute blast, amazing hospitality, reasonable prices, and such a fun space for kids at the party ranging from 2-7 years old. I would live here with my son if we were able to take advantage of more of their open hours, but it's tough to get there on weekdays after work before 6, so we'll definitely be there on Saturdays!

Review: Such a cool place and a great addition to the community. Our little one absolutely loved it. There is a really cool gymnastics area, a really cool room for magnetic shapes (with some areas with metal walls which were a really fun feature), two cute little trampoline areas, tons of seating, and more! I will say grippy socks would be a good idea as the floors were a little slick in some areas (I assume it is from them being cleaned). The entire place is spotless and very clean. We‚Äôll be going back many times and look forward to getting a 3 month pass the next time we go!

Review: ‚≠ê 1 out of 5 stars

We visited this indoor playground recently, and unfortunately, it was a very disappointing and concerning experience. The facility was noticeably dirty ‚Äî floors, equipment, and play areas all felt poorly maintained. To make matters worse, staff were mostly standing around, not engaging with kids or actively monitoring the space.

A major red flag: we found a vape on the ground inside the children‚Äôs play area. This is completely unacceptable in a space meant to be safe for young kids.

But the most upsetting part is that a few days after our visit, my daughter developed hand, foot, and mouth disease. She‚Äôs not in daycare and hasn‚Äôt been around any other children recently, so we‚Äôre confident this is where it came from. Illnesses happen, but in this case, it really feels like a direct result of a lack of proper sanitation and oversight.

This place has potential, but until they make serious improvements to cleanliness and safety standards ‚Äî and actually supervise the space ‚Äî we won‚Äôt be back.

Review: A great place for all ages. We celebrated my daughter's birthday who turned one year old. While I appreciate the inclusions for the birthday party package ( drinks, fruit snack, bring your own food, 3 hr party, etc) I have some feedback/concerns:
1. Each child at the party is given ""flames"" for games and ride but they put EVERYONE'S flames on one card. A savings for the company but an inconvenience for the host and guest.
2. ""Unlimited"" drinks are 2 liters but they provide small cups. So bring your own. Another savings for the company but an inconvenience for the host and guest. Individual cans/bottles would be preferred. Especially for the water, instead of 1 gal bottle.
3.  Several older kids kept coming into the toddler area. They were fully staffed, most of them positioned behind the counter. Only one birthday party in session (mine) but no employees even attempted to regulate the toddler area.
4. I booked the morning party time (10:30am) with hopes to have first access to a clean toddler area. It was very noticeable that the surfaces/floor was not clean. Therefore in my opinion the cleanliness of the ball pit is questionable. I would have rated this place at least a 4 but had to deduct another star due to cleanliness. Cleanliness and safety should be their priority especially if they are providing a service for children.

However, the staff was friendly. Music selection was enjoyable. Thank you Bryant and Christie. They let me use an extra table for my party. Bryant was always checking on us.

The play area is a great size; not too big to lose track of your kids but not too small that they get bored fast. Lots of other kids, too, so my niece and nephew had a ton of fun socializing. The food and drinks were well-priced and the games were easy to win including the claw games. We‚Äôve been here for about 2 hours and the kids are tiring out. Well worth the time and money!

I can see my daughter in the whole space even if I am sitting down at a table. 10/10 recommend!

Review: We had an absolutely fantastic experience at Dreamy Cloud! We had to scramble to find an indoor venue for our 2-year-old's birthday party at the last minute due to unexpected bad weather, and they were incredibly accommodating. The play area was clean, safe, and perfect for little ones. The kids had a blast!

A huge shoutout to Teresa, who went above and beyond, her service and support were exceptional. She was friendly, efficient, and made the entire process stress-free. We truly appreciate her dedication to ensuring our party was a success.

We highly recommend Dreamy Cloud for anyone looking for a fun, indoor playplace, especially for birthday parties. We'll definitely be back!

Review: We had my daughters birthday party here this past weekend and if I could give them more then 5 stars on here I would!!! From the first time I reached out to get information about booking a party to the morning of communication was amazing! They always made sure I was up to date with what was going on and what I needed to know prior to party day!

The day of the party they were beyond helpful making sure we had everything we needed and they even offered to help unload my car! They helped keep the pace of the party so everything was timed out perfectly!

My daughter and her friends had the absolute best time and she has asked me every day since when we can go back there to play!!

I can‚Äôt thank dreamy cloud indoor play enough for making my daughter‚Äôs party so special and for taking all the stress of hosting a party off of me by making it so easy!!  We will definitely be back!!

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

The staff was super friendly and made us feel welcome right away. Everything felt really safe and well-organized, which gave me peace of mind while the kids played freely.

It‚Äôs the perfect place for open play, rainy days, or just letting the little ones burn off some energy. My nieces didn‚Äôt want to leave! We‚Äôll definitely be coming back.

Review: I came here with my daughter. I see that this place needs to upgrade and repair many things. The most worrying thing is that the slide is not good when sliding in a supine position to the end of the path or the baby bumps his head on the floor. The staff should pay attention to review this part. I went to Giggle Town where they gave away free socks for parents and children, more games and an entry price of only $10 for unlimited hours. This place has limited hours and the ticket price includes tax of $16 and 1 candy here is sold for $4. You can see ‚ÄúGiggle Town‚Äù they make a lot of games. My comment here is that I want the business to develop and provide better quality service. Although you guys are doing very well, you also need to change to be better and better for customers. I give you 5*, support you, great friends and hope you do better for the little angels and for the community. Thank you

Review: The hive is very neat! This small town needed this after Polk county remolded the outdoor playgrounds. This is going to be a popular place on hot, rainy and cold days! This is a great indoor playground and has many sensory play area for little ones, plus a under 3 baby/toddler zone. They even have a semi private area that can be rented for parties. My 11 month old and 6 year each had there only spaces and had fun for hours. I also appreciate nit having to worry about big kids/teenagers running around and nocking into my child which is sometimes you find at parks and some of the larger indoor playground, jumping gyms.

There is different lanes for sensory and imagination play. Each of the 4 lanes are themed, under the sea, construction zone, outdoor/picnic, and house/doll. The only call out is we noticed the bottom baseboard in the lanes had a rough texture, so if not careful, could get a splinter. All the other boards in the place were smooth and laquered.

Something to note, we hadn't been before they moved the baby zone but talking to some parents, they voiced they didn't like how small it is now. The baby zone used to be where the party area is now. Parents were saying there was more room for them to run around and spread out. On the other hand I could understand the need for larger party area to accommodate larger parties. I didn't mind the baby area and we there on Sunday afternoon after the church crowd. The only thing I didn't like was the net gate used to act as a baby safety gate. Toddlers were climbing over it, under it and around it where it's only attached and hooked at the bottom. Looks broke. Would like to see a solid 3' wall with a swinging gate like at the entrance of the place.

There are a few adult games scattered about, table games like checkers, Jenga and chess. There are large yard games like corn hole, connect 4, tick tac toe.

There is plenty of tables with metal bar stool seats. I personally would have liked to see lower seating with back support that is more children friendly and more comfortable for parents to lounge while the kids play. However they do have two leather futon couches and 4 cushioned arm chairs towards the stage, set up in two living room style sets. There are also plenty of high chairs for babies and they looked clean!

The hive offers WiFi and a variety of refreshments and snacks. I had one of there nitro coffees (never had before) but was very good and creamy. The flavoring range is surprisingly amazing if you are willing to be adventurous and try new things. The also offer craft sodas, teas, and traditional coffee drinks you get at a coffee shop. There is ice cream, we got the waffle bubble and it was so yummy. So much ice cream for the $7. So worth it. There are snacks starting at $1, chips, gummies, dunkaroos, etc.

My daughter keeps asking me when we are going to go back again. Great hangout place, for. Both parents and kids. A little bit of everything for everyone.

I wanted to share how much we enjoyed our first visit today. I was immediately impressed by how clean and welcoming your facility is. The staff members we encountered were also incredibly friendly and made us feel right at home.

As a work-from-home mom, I particularly appreciated the opportunity to get some work done while my children could play in such a comfortable and safe environment. Additionally, the sensory-friendly activities were absolutely perfect for my son who has autism.

Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful experience for my family. We are already looking forward to our next visit!

They enjoyed themselves immensely. I‚Äôve been telling everyone I can think of that have kids or grands to come here. Everything you see online, all the bouncy houses are all here!

Review: Eve‚Äôs Garden was such an amazing experience for both me and my son. There are lots of entertainment activities to occupy 1 year olds while parents overlook their children. I viewed items and areas being cleaned throughout our time there and I love that there are 3-4 bathrooms (that I‚Äôve counted) on sight. Although the virtual experience with the sandbox was not available, my son still enjoyed himself playing in the sand. There was even a painting opportunity for the kids. Overall this is the place to go for a quality experience for your kids.

Review: In response to Curt Digla & Nordrissa Lewis:
I completely disagree with this review, as my experiences at this venue have always and consistently been the complete opposite. It‚Äôs clear that the reviewer had a frustrating visit, but many of their complaints seem exaggerated or based on misunderstandings.
First, calling this place a ""glorified daycare"" is unfair. It‚Äôs an indoor entertainment space designed for kids to have fun in a safe and engaging environment. The bounce houses, attractions, and activities are exactly what one would expect from a family-friendly venue.
It makes perfect business sense for certain attractions to be available only on specific days to encourage visits during slower periods (i.e. Wednesday)‚Äîthis is a common business strategy, not an attempt to deceive customers.
Regarding pricing, hosting a party at any entertainment venue comes with costs, and $416 for a birthday party that includes a dedicated space, play areas, and food is actually quite reasonable compared to similar venues. Pizza and Capri Suns are standard party offerings, and expecting gourmet options at this price point is unrealistic.
As for the cake, I don‚Äôt know of a single venue that includes cakes as part of the package‚Äîoutside cakes are clearly allowed, so all it takes is asking. However, last-minute issues can happen anywhere, and instead of escalating frustration, a simple check with staff could have clarified the situation.
The owners and their family members are PHENOMENAL, and their staff is professional. If a child was asked to remove a wristband, I have no doubt it was handled appropriately. The accusation of racial favoritism is not only unfair but also unfounded‚ÄîTHIS BUSINESS DOES NOT OPERATE ON RACIAL BIAS.
Additionally, the claim that the venue fabricates positive reviews is simply false.
Comparing this experience to renting a bounce house at home completely ignores the fact that not everyone has the space, time, or desire to host a party themselves. Many parents appreciate the convenience of an all-in-one venue where they don‚Äôt have to worry about setup, cleanup, or keeping kids entertained.
This review is overly negative and fails to recognize the value this venue provides. My personal experience, as well as that of many others, has been overwhelmingly positive.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VENUE TO PARENTS‚ÄîIT IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST, FRIENDLIEST INDOOR PLAY AREAS WE HAVE EVER TAKEN OUR LITTLE ONE TO. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!

On Wednesdays we come for toddler time and since my toddler isn‚Äôt in daycare, it‚Äôs nice to have a social setting where he can meet other kids.

I also have a 6 month old and I look forward to him enjoying the amenities at Eve‚Äôs!!!!!

Review: I‚Äôve been bringing my 3-year-old son to Eve's Garden Indoor Playground for the past five months, and I only have great things to say about the owner and staff. If you're looking for a safe, family-friendly, Christian-based environment that uplifts children and offers engaging, kid-friendly programs, this is the place to be!

Every time we visit, I can sit back and relax, knowing my son is safe and well cared for. The staff is attentive, engaging, and truly makes the experience enjoyable for both kids and parents. They also offer a variety of fun and educational programs each month, which I absolutely love! Highly

Review: I was here yesterday at my cousins 2nd birthday party and I had a bad experience I completely agree with Niva and Curt, when having a child micromanaging other kids and snatching their wristband off is very unprofessional not only that the male owner comes to a party to try and check someone about a bad review is unprofessional and unreal. The prices are too high for it to be a daycare center with 2 bouncy houses. 30$ to do nothing is insane. Then for you to use the same paint brushes for each child face like Covid and other things not going around is crazy. I rate this place a 0/10 I will never send my worst enemy there.

Review: I am here now with my nephew and daughter. They both are enjoying the experience. I hate that someone saw it necessary to post a bad review, It‚Äôs really sad. The building accommodates the amount of bounce houses that it can according to its size, no false advertising at all. If someone is looking for more they could have simply driven an hour away to find one. No need to tear down an awesome business. It‚Äôs clean on the inside and many staff around to keep it that way and to offer any help. I personally will come back to this business with awesome owners and I‚Äôm glad that they have brought an indoor playground here to Conyers as it was greatly needed and appreciated.

Review: We came here as part of a birthday party and had a nice time! We were greeted warmly, and the facility was immaculately clean which started things off perfectly. They have a couple different bounce houses, an infant/small toddler area, an obstacle course, and two different sensory rooms. This would be an excellent rainy day spot to take a family, especially if you have infants and school-aged kiddos.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a five star review is because the venue itself isn‚Äôt great at noise dampening and with the motors from the inflatables, it‚Äôs very loud even before there are kids running and playing. Overall, if we lived closer we‚Äôd absolutely be frequenting here!

Review: I can‚Äôt rave about Eve‚Äôs Garden enough!!! I took my daughter to this establishment for the very first time, and she had an absolute blast!!! I was extremely impressed and pleased when I called in and spoke with the owner. Her name is Scherika (I‚Äôll come back and confirm if I spelled her name correctly). She was so nice, pleasant, down to earth and professional all at once. When we arrived, my child was the only guest there, but the owner assured me that she would have someone to play with in no time, as her children were just finishing their studies. We received a first visit discount, but even without the discount, it‚Äôs still very reasonably priced. She and her children were so sweet and attentive to my daughter. She also has massage chairs for the parents (better than the nail salon pedicure chairs). She noticed that my daughter was tugging on my hand, but I had just sat down and began the massage, so she came and got my baby, took her by the hand, and led her to yet another one of the many activities that they have to offer, so that I could finish my massage‚Ä¶ THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for that!!! I‚Äôm also happy that no shoes are allowed, so that keeps dirty shoes germs at bay. All in all, a wonderful experience!!! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back in a couple of days!!!

Review: I was searching for an indoor playroom in my area to take my nearly 20-month-old granddaughter and found Eve's Garden at the last minute when I had almost given up. I wasn't in the mood for the chaos of a trampoline park, but with the extreme heat, I knew we wanted to be indoors. From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by the safe, clean and fun environment. My granddaughter had an absolute blast, and to my surprise, my 11-year-old son enjoyed himself as well. They had air hockey, basketball, jumbo connect 4, an inflatable obstacle course, an interactive sand room and an interactive ball game room with a projector for him.

The variety of activities available kept both children entertained and busy. It took my granddaughter a little while to acclimate, but in no time, she was running around, laughing and playing! For this outing, I was specifically looking for a toddler-friendly space, ensuring she could have fun without the risk of being trampled by bigger kids. Eve's Garden perfectly fit the bill, and it was an added bonus that my son also had a great time. The music was amazing, and although we didn't partake because we had just eaten, I saw that they had a variety of snacks and drinks for purchase.

I've already recommended Eve's Garden to a dozen friends and family and can't wait to visit again when my granddaughter is back in town. The experience, staff, cleanliness and overall atmosphere were all top-notch. 10 out of 10!

My six year old had a meltdown, unlike one I had ever seen when it was time to leave. The owner helped me, made me not feel judged, and even whispered a quick prayer for my patience. I don't think she really understands how much I needed and value that! This place is really a gem!!!!

Review: Came to visit the area from Maine & were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this business. We brought our 3 & 1 year old there today. Had a lovely time. Staff was so kind & patient with the kids. If you want a place to let the kids get out some energy in a controlled & safe environment, this is the place! My kids had a blast & didn't want to leave. Give them a try :)

Review: We had our daughter‚Äôs second birthday party here the other weekend and it went so amazing. Everyone was so helpful, kind and eager to assist or make things easier for us. I really couldn‚Äôt say enough great things about the establishment and the family who runs it.
The thing that drew me in to this facility is how it is someplace safer and more aimed to the younger kids. Taking my toddler to a big name jump place is absolutely out of the question. They‚Äôd get trampled before getting completely through the door. At Eve‚Äôs garden, I know she‚Äôs able to run and jump and play- just living her best life and I don‚Äôt have to be in constant fear she‚Äôs going to get ran over by a big kid.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they have things aimed for the older kids, it‚Äôs not just for toddlers. My 8 year old daughter and 9 year old niece had a blast there as well! There‚Äôs a really cool obstacle course kinda thing that they had a great time with. There‚Äôs an interactive sand table that‚Äôs one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen for kids in a long time. Ok maybe not just for kids cause I did play with it too lol and there‚Äôs an air hockey table that took me back to my childhood daycare days.
Overall, this place is great. The staff is great. The environment is great. We will definitely be back to Eve‚Äôs garden indoor playground!!!
Thank you all again so much for helping us with our party. Top tier. 10/10 very much recommend!!!

Review: This fun place just opened a few weeks ago and my kids had a great time! For ages 13 and under, they have inflatables, a basketball arcade game, ball wall room with projector, a standing sand box with projector, air hockey, large connect four, and a designated place for really little ones. They even have a spacious party room for you to have your birthday parties! The whole place, including the bathrooms, are clean and the owners and staff are super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend Eve's Garden Indoor Play for a fun time!

Review: Eves Garden is a fun place for kids. My daughters had a blast playing on the inflatables, air hockey and the interactive ball wall. It is the perfect size for my youngest daughter who is 3 years old to stay entertain without being overwhelmed with too many people or kids running around. My oldest, 6 years old, could have played on the ball wall all night. They really enjoyed themselves and the owners were really friendly in making sure the girls were safe and having fun.

For future, please note that babies who play are $5 (while babies who do not are free - we try to charge a lower dollar for the babies, but ultimately, we cannot sustain providing entertainment, toys, and space for this age if it is free), children over 12m are $8, and additional siblings only are $6 each.

Review: HUGE perk about this place is that adults CAN STAND UP STRAIGHT in the jungle gym. I have never been to an indoor playground where it is tall enough for that, not even Jump City Scarborough. It makes it so much more comfortable for all us parents who have kids who drag us around through the whole thing. Also, the layout is so well thought out. Lots of mazes and turns. Many different options on going up and down, of different difficulty levels. There are probably 5 or 6 slides, all super slidey and fun even for an adult. Good enclosed toddler area with lots of padding.

The price is great because you get indoor playground, laser tag, trampoline park, rock climbing wall, ninja obstacle course, all for one price. Only arcade you have to pay for, but $20 can get you around 10+ games. We chose 12 rings and a coin purse as our prize.

This is probably my top choice of indoor playground. It is like the better version of the Scarborough location. Staff are helpful and professional, they do well at maintaining safety and cleanliness.

Food: everything tastes decent. The fries look measly for $6 but interestingly they were a nice added touch, we did not regret them. The cheese on the pizza is good.

Ways to improve: laser tag area is a bit small. Imaginative play around for toddlers is lacking toys. Some arcade games were broken but had no sign, causing us to have to go to the attendant to ask for our credits back.

Review: I do not recommend visiting The Jump City Richmond Hill.
We attended a birthday party - an extremely unpleasant experience.
The staff is unfriendly and, what is especially outrageous, rude.
The whole party lasted only 2 hours, the children did not have time to play or communicate. And at the end they literally kicked us out.
Only when we had already packed our things and were ready to leave, we were ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to stay for another 20 minutes - but the mood was already spoiled.
Although the premises are large, they are organized completely ineffectively.
The floor is very cold, the surface is hard, you need to walk on it in socks, because you leave your shoes and things in the open locker room.
The children quickly get cold, and the staff wears sneakers.
As a result, all the children got sick after the party, as did some of the adults.
The attitude of the staff leaves much to be desired - instead of help and understanding, we encountered rudeness and irritation.
Against this background, the price is absolutely not justified, and the impression of the holiday was spoiled for everyone.
There are many other children's centers in the area, where the organization, service and conditions are much better.
This place does not even deserve one star.

But after reading the reviews here about rude staff, bag searches, and forcing everyone, including babies (and those who've come with perfectly serviceable grip socks) to buy yours, and further having these complaints corroborated by my wife who visited approximately a year ago..

I've decided to forego our visit and take our business elsewhere...

In this day and age of Google and online reviews, your unwillingness to provide an environment where people feel welcomed and respected, coupled with your obvious disdain in an era where you must know customers are going to review your facility online, speaks volumes about your intent...

Review: Jump City (Richmond hill) made my daughter‚Äôs 6th birthday unforgettable, thanks entirely to their incredible staff! From the moment we arrived, the team went out of their way to make us feel special.  It felt like they were just as excited about the party as we were! The play area itself was fantastic (clean, safe, and packed with fun activities), but what truly stood out was how attentive and kind every single employee was. They remembered my daughter‚Äôs name.
I‚Äôve never seen a team so dedicated to making a birthday celebration seamless. They took care of everything‚Äîsetting up decorations, serving food, handling the cake. That‚Äôs the kind of care you don‚Äôt get everywhere. If you want a birthday party where the staff treats your child like family, Jump City Richmond hill is the place. We‚Äôre already planning our next visit

Review: Admission overpriced for the limited non-arcade games it offers. If 80% of the area is for arcade games, then the admission fee should reflect that!
The inflatable castle in the photos, which is why we chose the place,  doesn't exist. Food takes ages to be served.

Review: Weekdays are not so crowded as weekends .
Nice playground with divided area for small kids . We started to visit this playground from 8-9 months .

There is something like ‚Äú thematic rooms‚Äù bakery, fire department, supermarket, drugstore, but they have no inventory at all.
There are a few plastic fruits and vegetables left in the supermarket and a couple of parts in the fire department. It would be much more interesting for children if there were other rooms as well.

The entire center is occupied by slot machines. I understand that this is commercially valuable, but as a consumer I don‚Äôt like it.

Cool area with trampolines and rock climbing.

Review: The first thing that jumps out at you about Jump City is just how big it is.  Unfortunately because it's so big, it doesn't feel warm and inviting.

The floors are cold ceramic, and everything is strangely spaced out.

The good part is that with all that space, there's lots of room for activities and games for the kids including a large climbing structure with slides as well as a big trampoline area and an area for laser tag.

Our kids had fun, but I'm not sure we'll be back often because it's challenging for parents to keep an eye on their kids and it just doesn't feel warm and inviting like a kids playground should be.

I'd say it's a 3.5 rating, but I bumped it up to 4 because kids really seem to enjoy it and have fun, and that's what matters most.

Review: I like this place because it has a lot of options for all ages, from infants to kids. It has an infant/toddler area, a kids area, trampolines, rock climbing.

The negatives: it has arcades which can be supper overwhelming and distracting for toddlers. It also has their own kitchen inside that‚Äôs not very healthy or tasty, I don‚Äôt like their food options and the ones that I tried were really bad. They don‚Äôt allow you to bring anything other than water with you.

Overall it‚Äôs ok, I keep going anyway but I make sure my toddler eats before and I try to keep them away from all the distracting lights in the arcade.

Review: Feedback on My Experience at the Playground.
I have visited this playground multiple times with my children, and I would like to share a few concerns regarding my experience:
1.	Some of the staff members speak to children in a harsh and unfriendly manner, which can create an unpleasant experience for them.
2.	There seems to be a lack of proper supervision regarding the entry and exit of visitors, which raises safety concerns.
3.	On my last visit, I ordered a large pizza, but unfortunately, more than half of it fell to the ground immediately after I received it. When I asked a staff member for assistance in cleaning the area, she ignored my request and instead told me that I had to pay for a new pizza, even though I never requested a replacement. When I reiterated that I needed to clean the spilled pizza, she responded in a mocking tone, questioning why it had fallen.

It seems that some of the staff members are very young and have not been properly trained to provide quality customer service. Unfortunately, due to this experience, I have decided not to return to this location. I hope this feedback helps in improving your services.

Review: I recently visited your facility and appreciated its spacious layout, well-equipped play areas, and cleanliness. However, I have a few concerns.

First, safety is an issue due to hard, uncovered surfaces like columns, railings, stairs, and floors. Adding protective padding would reduce risks for children.

Second, the restriction on outside food and drinks is inconvenient for parents who wait for hours and prevents children from having healthy snacks like fruits and homemade meals.

Most importantly, the restaurant‚Äôs food quality was very poor. It was unsatisfactory in taste and even caused digestive issues. If outside food is not allowed, the provided meals should meet proper health and quality standards.

I hope you address these issues to improve the experience for families. Thank you for your attention.

Review: The goods:
- A variety of activities for youths, ages 14 and under.
- The winter opening hours on Sunday were not particularly busy.

The bads:
- The ""security"" checked bags for outside foods inconsistently; it appeared that certain individuals were targeted.
- There are numerous employees, but no one was disinfecting. This issue seems to be concentrated at the port of entry, where no one disinfected high-touch areas, and there were no hand sanitizers in and around the area.

My 6 and 2-year-old visited on Sunday together and both have exhibited the same symptoms since then. The only similar place they went was this play area. No one else has reported being sick. What is the disinfecting policy? They may clean the floors, but what about the play areas? What about the controllers on games? I noticed the floors being cleaned, but what about the play areas?

Sadly, I will not return for this reason. Both daughters now have developed a high fever, cough, runny nose, and lethargy. There has been no other common place where they both played and ate food.

There are different level arcade games, a slide with ball pit, a toddler section, trampolines, rock climbing wall and Lazer tag. To top it all off the place is extremely clean, even the washrooms. We had a 2 hour party booked and that came with our own personal staff who brought our food, cut the cake and packed away leftover food for us to take home. Jump City also took care of all set and clean up as well. Overall, it‚Äôs a great place for a party or just to spend a couple hours with the kids.

The place was very clean and the workers would continuously keep cleaning while we were there. They were strict on their safety rules but not in a mean way. They were just kindly ask you to not do something. Loved that they had snacks and drinks. They had so much to do in the little kids section and the bigger section.

Review: I recently visited Outslide In with my child, who has autism and sensory issues. Unfortunately, our experience was far from pleasant and highlighted a significant lack of accommodation for children with special needs.

My son struggles with sensory issues and will not keep socks on his feet. Despite explaining this to the staff along with the fact that he is non-verbal and autistic, we were persistently followed around by an employee holding a pair of socks and demanding that they be put on my son. This constant pressure and lack of understanding added unnecessary stress to what was supposed to be a fun outing.

Eventually, we left because he couldn‚Äôt keep the socks on and didn‚Äôt want an employee following us within arms distance the whole time. This exclusion felt incredibly unfair and discriminatory. It‚Äôs disheartening that places like this are not equipped to accommodate children with special needs.

Children with special needs should not be excluded from such places because of their differences. I hope that Outslide In can improve its policies and training to become more inclusive and understanding towards all children.

His dad and I rushed to start getting it cleaned up with baby wipes and trying to get him calmed down. Not 5 minutes later did we have an employee offering to get us napkins. They brought the napkins and a trash can. A few minutes after that an employee who is certified in first aid came over to check on him as well and opened the party room to give him and our family privacy while we cleaned him up and calmed him down. So thankful for the staff being understanding to his needs and being accommodating. Will absolutely be back!

And right when I got all the paper work filled out the worker was very snappy with us. Right when she said the rules to my campers and were set to go, she instantly called my boss saying how we aren‚Äôt doing our jobs and sending false information. Yes we have a lot of kids but we have been doing this all summer and we have already been to Outslide in earlier in the summer and that was great. The worker who was very rude was a blonde lady and she was very snappy and just was not making us feel welcome. Her boss was then called and I had to talk to him about making sure my other counselors were watching the kids. This place is too small for a bunch of late teens to crawl in the small spaces. These workers were also talking very rudely to all my other counselors who were trying to do their jobs. I get how seeing a bunch of kids walking in together are overwhelming but these are good kids. They haven‚Äôt done anything wrong other than having fun. I 100% recommend any parents to go to BIZZY BEE the staff there was very helpful and enjoyable.

Review: There is an employee with his kids there. I ended up supervising his kids with my granddaughter who was there for a private party.  I didn‚Äôt know it was also a daycare center - my poor granddaughter couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the birthday party because the girl kept pulling her out of the private party room!

Review: Usually, a fun place to bring the kids. There is a blonde woman, stomping around and yelling a little aggresively at young kids. She was not here earlier, it just appears she came in a bad mood and now wants to take it out on the kids having fun.

Review: We love this place and come back again and again. Big enough to entertain the kids for hours but small enough you can let the kids run around and sit and take a break or work. Space for physical and imaginary play. Cleanest playground we've been to anywhere! The staff is friendly and tidying and cleaning throughout the day and making sure the restrooms are stocked. You can also leave for lunch and come back later same day. Our kids love it and so do we!

Review: Way over staffed the atmosphere was awesome. But we felt as if them having so many people on staff that our kids where not allowed to run free without someone steeping in and saying they can't do that or touch that. If a child took something from the ""vet clinic"" to the other side of the play area a worker was following them to take it and put it back in that area. I did like how they closed off certain areas to wipe & disinfect toys and items that where handled.

Review: Pros: all inclusive! Pay to enter.  Stay all day or a few hours. Take a wrist band and come back later to play again as part of your entrance fee. So many options for play. Hours of fun! Gated playgrounds, kid friendly bathrooms, chairs and seating for supervising adults placed in and outside of the gates. Staff are constantly walking around, resetting and monitoring safety of kids at play. Imagination rooms with open windows and doors (pizza shop, ice cream parlor,  grocery store, veterinarian,  and firehouse. Location is just around the corner from the food court, so no outside food allowed is not a big deal. Cafe with drinks, including coffee, and snacks is run by the Outslide In staff and located just inside their entrance.

Cons: the amount of kids can be very loud and the music being payed over the speakers can add to the sensory overload. No outside food or drink except water in unless you rent one of the party rooms. Party rooms are pricey for a small group.

Review: 5+ stars for The Funville Factory! A lovely venue. Safe, clean, and the perfect place to host your child's birthday party. We did my daughter's 4th birthday there this past weekend and everything was perfect. Jen (the owner) is awesome. So sweet, reliable and responsive. She wants everything to be easy and perfect for you as the busy parent. The rest of her staff is also so beyond sweet. Everyone had a BLAST! Also, the pizza they get from next store is really yummy (antico style) not just ""regular pizza."" The type of play stuff they have is really good for ranges of ages so my daughter and most of her friends are 4 but there were siblings there older and younger that all had things to be occupied with. We did the 3 hour galaxy package to have the place to ourselves, so worth it. 3 hours of play time is VERY generous!! Overall 10/10 experience. Wouldn't change a thing!!<3<3<3<3

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs fourth birthday at Funville Factory and it could not have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived, the owners were right there welcoming us and helping set everything up, making sure we had everything we needed. They even accommodated us with juice boxes, the cutest Super Kitties themed plates, and a pile of stickers that the kids went crazy over.

The place itself is a little smaller than some of the bigger indoor playgrounds, but honestly that was a huge plus. There was so much variety packed into the space with swings, slides, pretend houses, and climbing areas, and because it was cozy, it was easy to keep an eye on all the kids without feeling overwhelmed. The owners were constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy and calmly stepping in if two kids looked like they might get into a squabble. It felt so safe and thoughtfully run.

The party room looked amazing when we walked in, like a mini Super Kitties world made just for our daughter. They paid attention to every little detail, making sure every child had a seat, plenty of juice, and a stack of stickers to take home. It made the whole party feel really special and personal.

Funville Factory is perfect for younger kids, especially around two to six years old. It seems like they do not really accept kids older than six, which honestly makes sense because the space is so perfectly tailored for the little ones. If you have a four-year-old like we do, this place feels like a dream.

What really stood out the most was how personally involved the owners were the entire time. They were not just running the place, they were making sure our daughter and all her friends were having the best time. We could not have asked for a better experience and we will definitely be back.

Review: I‚Äôm a nanny for two sweet little girls ages 1 and 2 . I originally was going to have a friend with me to help take the girls to a park or something because it‚Äôs hard to take them places by myself. Our plans fell through but I really wanted the girls to have an adventure. So I searched indoor places and stumbled upon this place! So We went Last Friday in the evening and at first I was hesitant with the prices but I decided to give them a shot! And I‚Äôm sooo glad I did!! The pricing makes so much sense once you are in there! They have lots of toys and jungle gym type things for toddlers to play on! It‚Äôs super clean in there, even with it being a place for toddlers the germs are always everywhere. But the staff was frequently cleaning and watching over the kids so the parents or nanny ,like my self , can feel at ease and not have to be a Helicopter. MAJOR PLUS! They also have these cute slippers that you wear to go to the restrooms so your feet aren‚Äôt touching the bathroom floor! Lastly in the front they have snacks, more toys and gagets for the kids either free or a low price! Overall, me and the girls will Definitely be back! And thank you Funville for making our experience peaceful and fun!

This is a small business and the owner is super kind and personable. She really does enjoy children. The place is very clean. They sanitize constantly. My daughter never gets sick from here like other indoor play areas. It‚Äôs a great place to come anytime but it has been a life saver during cold rainy weather as well. They do parents night out which has been amazing. My daughter will not go to anyone but she will go to the owner at Funville. They also have lots of special events such as reading or arts and crafts. I highly recommend this place for just playing and for birthday parties. It was one of the best parties we held.

Review: I‚Äôve been going to Funville for a while now and I have to say this is the best place in town for young kids. I had a really hard time finding an age appropriate playspace that catered to toddlers.

Not only is this place suited for kids under 6, the staff does an incredible job of keeping the place clean and organized. An impressive feat with a bunch of 1&2 year olds running around.

I also had the chance to speak with the owner, and she takes cleanliness, safety, and overall experience very seriously while being incredibly personable.

I highly recommend Funville for any parents wanting a safe, fun place for their little!

Review: Funville factory is a cute little play place. It is tailed more for early elementary aged kids but a new mom friend and I met there to take our 8 month olds and it was still fun little things there for them to do. The staff members are really nice and the environment is SUPER clean. I love that they make you remove your shoes and have a designated bathroom area with provided slippers to go to the bathroom. It‚Äôs such a cute little area and they even do birth celebrations. Definitely recommend parents taking their kids if you‚Äôre looking.

Review: This place seems like a lot of fun for kids, has lots to play with, is clean and well-maintained, and has reasonable prices.

However, the two times I‚Äôve been there‚Äìweekday afternoons‚Äìit‚Äôs been uncomfortably crowded. They also have a fair bit of clutter from the toy kitchen, puzzles, train station, etc. that ends up littering the whole area.

Between the overcrowding and the clutter, my one-year-old was terribly overstimulated after an hour and a half each time we visited. He had trouble falling asleep‚Äìwent to bed well over an hour late‚Äìafter both of our visits. We get out and about doing toddler things most days and that‚Äôs never happened anywhere else, so for me that really highlights how overstimulating it is here.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun place for lots of kids, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a great environment for mine.

Review: This is the nicest indoor playground we found in the Atlanta area. I frequent quite a few of these with my 2 yo on rainy days and birth parties. I couldn't even have imagined one could be so nice until a friend brought me here. The colors are pastel and soothing, they play classical music, and the staff wipes down and tidies constantly throughout all the stations. They have stations for fine motor and gross motor skills. You just don't see overstimulated children, like the other ones. I love this place and will continue driving here from Brookhaven. The owner is really awesome too! My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves

Review: We stumbled across Funville earlier this summer (thank you OTP Mama for the tip!) It quickly became a favorite play spot for our toddler and was a life savor for us on those grueling hot summer days.

The place is AMAZING - with all sorts of toys/sensory exploration/playground fun you need to keep a toddler (or crew of toddlers!) entertained for hours on end. They also offer various packages - that you can take advantage of through their membership OR NOT. (I personally appreciate that flexibility in a membership/subscription dominant world) Of course they have birthday party packages, and we just hosted our son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect - but it was an amazing day that went off without a hitch. The owner, Jen, went above and beyond with the decorations. All I had to do was share the number of attendees and theme, and she took care of the rest (‚Ä¶and had it decorated better than I ever could have!!) Jen‚Äôs professionalism - which permeates through her entire staff - is top notch and the Funville team‚Äôs customer service makes party day enjoyable for everyone (parents too!). The pizza that‚Äôs included as part of the birthday package is delicious - and also happens to be right next store, in case you need to add on any last minute additions. (Have I mentioned the convenience of this experience??) My husband and I were carefree from start to finish and it really changed the entire day for us - it was totally worth it. They also took care of the gift bags AND had a special gift for the birthday boy.

THANK YOU Jen and the Funville Factory team for making this such a wonderful day - and planning experience - for my family! I absolutely recommend this place for anyone with kiddos (toddlers are the sweet spot, but I feel like kids up to 7 or 8 would also have a ball). And if you‚Äôre looking for a fun space for your next event, and a professional/customer-focused staff to help you execute, you‚Äôve found your spot!

Review: Funville was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. I purchased the private event package, and the place was closed to the public for a couple of hours. My daughter could enjoy the place comfortably with her friends, and I could relax and enjoy talking to my family and friends without worrying about cleaning, serving food, or setting up the decorations. The staff did a wonderful job with the decorations and setting up the tables. My daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse-themed birthday, so the staff decorated the party room according to that theme and even had Minnie Mouse plates and utensils for the cake. They also provided goodie bags for all my daughter‚Äôs friends. My friend told me how much her two kids loved what was in the good bags. My daughter also received a Funville T-shirt, a Mickey Mouse puzzle, and a lollipop.

Also, the package includes Napoli pizzas (the pizza place is next to Funville) for your guests. This was the first time I had Napoli pizza, and I fell in love with its fresh ingredients and overall flavor! Most of my guests had their pizza for the first time and are planning a separate trip to Funville and Napoli Pizza.

Another reason to have your toddler celebrate their birthday at Funville is that parents do not have to chase after their toddler. This is because Funville is a small space, but it is packed with interactive and fun activities that will keep them occupied. It is also clean and well-maintained thanks to the staff who ensure everything is in order. I could catch up on conversations with parents and enjoy myself while knowing my daughter is playing safely with other kids.

I highly recommend this event space! Thanks, Funville!

Review: Hi Valerie,

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize if our pricing felt too high for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our pricing:

	‚Ä¢	$1 for adults: We strive to keep our prices affordable. Many indoor playgrounds charge around $4.99 for adults, or even the same amount as for children. For comparison, our family recently visited the Peppa Pig Theme Park, which charged $70 for adults despite there being no rides for adults. (It was super fun to watch our kids having a BLAST!)
	‚Ä¢	$4 for children 8 months and younger: But they play for FREE WITH A PAYING SIBLING!
	‚Ä¢	$10 for children aged 9 to 21 months: Our playground is specially designed for this age group, with plenty of toys and activities tailored to their needs.
	‚Ä¢	$16 for children aged 22 months and up: We carefully researched our pricing and can assure you that our prices are among the most competitive in Georgia.

Regarding cleanliness, I can assure you that we take this very seriously. We clean and disinfect regularly throughout the day, even if it may not always be visible. We understand that while you‚Äôre focused on watching your child, it might be easy to miss our team in action. Additionally, we don‚Äôt mop the floors during business hours to avoid soaking your socks or causing slips and falls, which is why we require socks to be worn. We are also moving our shoe rack outside the entrance to help keep socks clean and ensure a better experience for everyone.

We appreciate your input and hope to welcome you back soon.

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly.

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

The way it is set up is fantastic so you can sit at the cafe tables and be able to see your kids in any area at all times. In addition to all the fun toys they have, today they also had a story time and craft which my kids loved doing. I highly recommend checking them out, we will definitely be back!

They have a no shoe policy, so you must wear socks.
The jungle gym is large enough for adults, it‚Äôs a great workout haha.
There‚Äôs a special area for kids 3 & under.
Also have a small cafe with 7Brew coffee, chips, chicken tenders, and other items.

They have an area for toddlers, a cool air tube thing on the wall, a bunch of fake buildings with different themes inside (like police, doctor, kitchen), and a gigantic maze type thing against the left wall when you walk in. They do serve food here and take cards. Also make sure to bring a pair of socks, there are no shoes past the entrance and you have to wear socks. I will be bringing my daughter back here in the future.

Review: I have been going to Bizzy Bee since 2022 with my daughter (5) and she still loves it! It‚Äôs normally busy on weekends, so great for the social butterflies who want a lot of kids to play with. I go with my son (2) on weekdays when the bigger kids are in school. They have fun activities for the littles during the week as well! The staff is always friendly to me and easy to talk to. I always see someone cleaning or putting things away. They have such fun play fixtures and I love that it‚Äôs in doors! Really accessible since it‚Äôs right behind the mall. We have also been to a number of their after hours events like the Halloween and Christmas parties or Bluey and Dino bashes! Super fun for the kids and always so worth it as a fun event to attend. The owners are very nice and attentive. You‚Äôll see them walking around and talking to parents. It is our favorite indoor play place in the Charleston area! 10/10 would recommend!

Review: As much as I want to love this place with how often I come here, I think the good reviews might be from parents who let their kids run off. Which indoor places can be great for. But if you do play along with your children, you will quickly find that most of the toys don‚Äôt have working batteries or are broken, the games you pay money for don‚Äôt work, and things like the air ball area aren‚Äôt kept up (vent cleaning) so they don‚Äôt work properly. At this point they can just be considered decorations. I can literally see the disappointment on my daughter‚Äôs face when these things happen and it hurts. $15 entry is not that cheap as a single dad, and should most definitely go towards these types of things.

I will say‚Äîthe staff is always walking around vacuuming and putting toys back in their respective area. Which is great. So these issues I stated should definitely be feasible to solve. Thank you!

Review: We love Bizzy Bee and have been coming here for years. It‚Äôs a fair price to get in, everything is super cute and it‚Äôs nice to have a cafe area for the adults. My only complaint is the addition of the stupid claw machine game. I know these things are a rip off. But repeatedly we got a stuffy perfectly just for the claw to slip right off without even moving it at all. As a result my kid was upset because it was unfair. I feel like it‚Äôs something small but if you literally cannot win what‚Äôs the point of putting it in a kids play place except to upset the kids and frustrate the parents? Other than that we do love Bizzy Bee and recommend it to everyone especially when it‚Äôs cold out.

Review: A friend of the family had their childs'
birthday party at this place (prior to this I had never been here before). From an outsider looking in, personally, I thought that they pretty much ruined this kids birthday party for her & she is young. She was 2 going on 3. It matters when you have to stand outside & wait with everyone who is supposed to be attending the party with you (plus some... because there were other's out there waiting for other birthday parties doing the same) so I'm sure you can imagine how crowded it was & you can't go in.  They were over 10 minutes late letting everyone in for the birthday party so we're all forced to stand outside, with other larger groups of people (that seemed to be waiting for the same thing that we all were) which was waiting for other birthday parties to begin as well. It was extremely disorganized. I would never want to have my child's birthday at this place and this is just the beginning. I, personally, think they need to work on time management but what do I know..? Oh & going back to that whole ""10 minutes late thing"" don't you guys worry about it... They ""fixed it"" by just  tacking on 10 extra minutes at the end (after the family had to say something to them about it) but that makes it ok right...? Especially to the 3 year old (I'm sure the child was extremely understanding). It was so chaotic in there & I'm not sure how things work when you're just going to enjoy the day with your family, but for the people dealing with the ""birthday party thing"", there is no one keeping any sort of track with the children, making sure at the very least that the child is going home with the parents & family that the child should be (oh, & not getting injured while being there either because that's important but you sign a waiver so I guess it is what it is... Play at your own risk).  We finally got into the ""party room"" & it was so crowded, & were pretty much forced to rush the children into everything that they were going to be doing in that room & that includes eating (and of course I don't need to tell you the pizza was late so every kid there was starving). They finally get the pizza & then are forced to rush everyone there through that process & eat the cake, only to have to turn right around from that to hurry up & watch the birthday kid open presents. The kid's barely had any real time to enjoy & play & run & have fun around the place (except for, of course, when they were waiting on the late pizza to arrive) but even then it was so crowded with so many other people there that the kids couldn't really enjoy it. I would not have been a very happy person, let alone parent of a kid having a birthday party here & I would have had to pay in advance (and I'm sure it's no small amount of money) to deal with all this. Be warned: no matter what the reason you are there, birthday or otherwise, WATCH YOUR CHILD, because Lord knows, no one else is & no one there can be relied on to it properly & no one watches their own child better than YOU! It's unfortunate because it should (in my opinion) be a place where you can sit & relax and watch them play from a distance & get a little bit of time to breathe (which we all know as parents is hard to come by). I did not get that feeling from this establishment & personally, I would not want to go back. Just telling it like I see it. Sorry, it wouldn't be me if it wasn't honest. Good luck out there guys & girls & try to fit in some fun (just maybe not a that spot. Lol). Be warned too... If you ever see anything there that seems like you are allowed to color... Don't do it! It's always for another event! It's for another event! SORRY! Printing anything out is too much to ask so just don't do it! Just don't do it! Ok! Other than that have fun, I guess, and good luck! It seems like every time I walk into this place, it's always something. Smh

Review: Today our grandson went to Bizzy Bee to enjoy some much needed downtime after his mother has had major surgery.  In the short time he was there, our grandson was bullied. These children teased and confined him to a point he could not get past them.  These children were getting in other children's faces, coughing in their faces and shaking their bottoms in their faces.
Fortunately, his father was able to get to him quickly and spoke up to the free range children to make them stop their behavior.  Bizzy Bee states in their policy they have zero tolerance for bullying.  However, no employee came to his aid.  Where were the parents who have to sign a form stating they have to be mindful at all times of what their children are doing?

Review: Not worth the price! My granddaughter had a birthday party here and the kids had a good time which ultimately is the goal. My issue is the place smells of mildew or mold. There‚Äôs just a stench about the building which was nasty. I walked out with headache and clogged head.

Be sure to bring your socks! Everybody is required to walk around in their socks, supposedly to keep the place sanitary, although the workers are walking around with crocs really? So I guess the employees shoes are sanitized?  So be prepared to spend $3.50 on a pair of socks. Floors were disgusting! Walk around in a pair of white socks and you will discard them when you get home, not to mention if you go to the restroom, you can‚Äôt use your shoes, You have to go in your socks. Disgusting!

Review: Not a bad place to take your children on school breaks, holidays, and during the summer when it's broiling outside. Spacious area with plenty of room to play. Needs a better food court, though. Very little food is offered, and the service is poor. The last time we found the food area closed. So, nothing to eat or drink, and you're not supposed to bring drinks from the outside. Uncomfortable benches and chairs to sit on, so bring a small pillow. Overall, a fun atmosphere for children.

(Housekeeping wasn't a top priority is all I am saying.)

Review: My 2 year old has a blast here, it‚Äôs huge and there‚Äôs so many different areas to play for all ages.
The manager is fantastic and is always on it. The employees return toys, clean, and vacuum often.
They have lots of events every month and we went to their Halloween party which was fun.
There are definitely some parents that sit in the cafe on their device and don‚Äôt watch their kids wreaking havoc on the place but that is going to happen at any play place, and is not the fault of the business. The manager is pretty good about reminding kids and parents of the rules and there is definitely a noticeable difference in how smoothly things go when the manger is there.
Overall though a fun place for the kids and I recommend ordering the pass for multiple days to save money.

Review: This place is loud and overstimulating. When you enter you are asked if you have a number and if you filled out the waiver. The staff are not very friendly. They pointed to a sign with the QR code and then we stood there filling it out on our phone while trying to be out of the way for others entering. It would be helpful if instead they asked if it was our first time or not and then politely explain the process. We had to ask for socks as we saw a sign upon entering that understandably socks are required and we forgot ours. Luckily it‚Äôs not too pricey.
Unfortunately some parents don‚Äôt watch their children and I had to hover over my child to keep them from getting grabbed, hit, growled at, and toys thrown at them or hit in the face. I look around for a parent and they are sitting at the table, talking and looking at their phones; not watching their own children so unfortunately other parents are left to police them.
It‚Äôs a very cute pretend play place with a walled off area for the smaller babies thankfully, but even still watch out for the bullies. I noticed that the toys for the pretend play get strewn all the way across the room. I also noticed staff wiping down one slide while we were there. There is a quiet room that I didn‚Äôt check out but I feel like I need it more than my kid.
I‚Äôm not sure if we will be back or not

Review: I love this place and so do my kids, but there's two things that prevent us from coming here regularly. One, the admission fee is a bit too high especially for us larger families. I have 4 kids so coming here is a ""once in a while"" thing, although if the prices were lower we would love to come much more often. The other issue, is that we get sick EVERY single time we play here. The first visit, my kids got hand, foot, mouth disease. The second visit, strep throat. Every other visit has luckily just given us normal colds, but without fail, I know anytime we come here that we'll all end up sick within a few days. And I've been a mom for 10+ years, we've been to tons of kids playground places over the years, I am well aware that these types of places spread germs very easily but it is not a coincidence that my kids get sick here after we've spent a few hours playing, when they haven't been sick since our last visit. I always pay attention to what the employees are doing and I see them picking up toys and putting them where they belong, and wiping down tables at the cafe, but never any disinfecting of the toys itself. I'm sure that part gets taken care of after hours, but it clearly isn't enough. I've been to kids indoor play places that have systems in place such as baskets on the wall for parents to put toys that appear dirty or have been in a kids mouth, and other places that have a employee specifically for walking around and wiping down surfaces and toys with a rag and a cleaner. There's no fool proof method to prevent germs from spreading at places like this, I know it's inevitable, but it would be great to see more effort in that aspect.

Review: The young ladies who checked us in was less then pleasing to talk too. And in my opinion If they are having a party on any day they should only allow certain amount of kids for regular play. It takes the fun out of play time if your only allowed to play on one side and not the whole play area. Or at least close doors to others not attending the party.

They have charging stations so if you are working or watching movie while kids can play that would be good idea as well.

Review: I am so sad that we can no longer go to Bizzy Bee! My children used to love coming here. The toys were broken and missing pieces. I was told they were being sanitized but never saw them. The hair salon had no hair brushes, hair bows were broken, and doll heads were in rough shape. The baby doll section had no bottles, diapers, etc. The veterinarian section had no tools to ‚Äúdoctor up‚Äù the few stuffed animals they had. The tool section had no tools to play with the screws on the tool bench. The car garage had no cars. When I talked to the manager she said they had an issue with lice, and were replacing items. LICE. They have had issues with LICE! For $15 it isn‚Äôt worth the money. When I asked for a refund, I was told quickly they do not do that and the manager even came back at me and told me there is still plenty for my child to do. As my child is not allowed in the 0-3 year old section, there is nothing else for her to do. We will not return, and I would think twice before coming. Outslide Inn is a much better option!

She wants everything to be easy and perfect for you as the busy parent. The rest of her staff is also so beyond sweet. Everyone had a BLAST! Also, the pizza they get from next store is really yummy (antico style) not just ""regular pizza."" The type of play stuff they have is really good for ranges of ages so my daughter and most of her friends are 4 but there were siblings there older and younger that all had things to be occupied with. We did the 3 hour galaxy package to have the place to ourselves, so worth it. 3 hours of play time is VERY generous!! Overall 10/10 experience. Wouldn't change a thing!!<3<3<3<3

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs fourth birthday at Funville Factory and it could not have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived, the owners were right there welcoming us and helping set everything up, making sure we had everything we needed. They even accommodated us with juice boxes, the cutest Super Kitties themed plates, and a pile of stickers that the kids went crazy over.

The place itself is a little smaller than some of the bigger indoor playgrounds, but honestly that was a huge plus. There was so much variety packed into the space with swings, slides, pretend houses, and climbing areas, and because it was cozy, it was easy to keep an eye on all the kids without feeling overwhelmed. The owners were constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy and calmly stepping in if two kids looked like they might get into a squabble. It felt so safe and thoughtfully run.

The party room looked amazing when we walked in, like a mini Super Kitties world made just for our daughter. They paid attention to every little detail, making sure every child had a seat, plenty of juice, and a stack of stickers to take home. It made the whole party feel really special and personal.

Funville Factory is perfect for younger kids, especially around two to six years old. It seems like they do not really accept kids older than six, which honestly makes sense because the space is so perfectly tailored for the little ones. If you have a four-year-old like we do, this place feels like a dream.

What really stood out the most was how personally involved the owners were the entire time. They were not just running the place, they were making sure our daughter and all her friends were having the best time. We could not have asked for a better experience and we will definitely be back.

I originally was going to have a friend with me to help take the girls to a park or something because it‚Äôs hard to take them places by myself. Our plans fell through but I really wanted the girls to have an adventure. So I searched indoor places and stumbled upon this place! So We went Last Friday in the evening and at first I was hesitant with the prices but I decided to give them a shot! And I‚Äôm sooo glad I did!! The pricing makes so much sense once you are in there! They have lots of toys and jungle gym type things for toddlers to play on! It‚Äôs super clean in there, even with it being a place for toddlers the germs are always everywhere. But the staff was frequently cleaning and watching over the kids so the parents or nanny ,like my self , can feel at ease and not have to be a Helicopter. MAJOR PLUS! They also have these cute slippers that you wear to go to the restrooms so your feet aren‚Äôt touching the bathroom floor! Lastly in the front they have snacks, more toys and gagets for the kids either free or a low price! Overall, me and the girls will Definitely be back! And thank you Funville for making our experience peaceful and fun!

Review: Funville factory is a cute little play place. It is tailed more for early elementary aged kids but a new mom friend and I met there to take our 8 month olds and it was still fun little things there for them to do. The staff members are really nice and the environment is SUPER clean. I love that they make you remove your shoes and have a designated bathroom area with provided slippers to go to the bathroom. It‚Äôs such a cute little area and they even do birth celebrations. Definitely recommend parents taking their kids if you‚Äôre looking.

Review: This place seems like a lot of fun for kids, has lots to play with, is clean and well-maintained, and has reasonable prices.

However, the two times I‚Äôve been there‚Äìweekday afternoons‚Äìit‚Äôs been uncomfortably crowded. They also have a fair bit of clutter from the toy kitchen, puzzles, train station, etc. that ends up littering the whole area.

Between the overcrowding and the clutter, my one-year-old was terribly overstimulated after an hour and a half each time we visited. He had trouble falling asleep‚Äìwent to bed well over an hour late‚Äìafter both of our visits. We get out and about doing toddler things most days and that‚Äôs never happened anywhere else, so for me that really highlights how overstimulating it is here.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun place for lots of kids, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a great environment for mine.

The staff is very friendly and attentive, which enhances the overall experience.

They also offer party events and ""Parents' Night Out""!

We have a fantastic time every time we visit.

Review: This is the nicest indoor playground we found in the Atlanta area. I frequent quite a few of these with my 2 yo on rainy days and birth parties. I couldn't even have imagined one could be so nice until a friend brought me here. The colors are pastel and soothing, they play classical music, and the staff wipes down and tidies constantly throughout all the stations. They have stations for fine motor and gross motor skills. You just don't see overstimulated children, like the other ones. I love this place and will continue driving here from Brookhaven. The owner is really awesome too! My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves

Review: We stumbled across Funville earlier this summer (thank you OTP Mama for the tip!) It quickly became a favorite play spot for our toddler and was a life savor for us on those grueling hot summer days.

The place is AMAZING - with all sorts of toys/sensory exploration/playground fun you need to keep a toddler (or crew of toddlers!) entertained for hours on end. They also offer various packages - that you can take advantage of through their membership OR NOT. (I personally appreciate that flexibility in a membership/subscription dominant world) Of course they have birthday party packages, and we just hosted our son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect - but it was an amazing day that went off without a hitch. The owner, Jen, went above and beyond with the decorations. All I had to do was share the number of attendees and theme, and she took care of the rest (‚Ä¶and had it decorated better than I ever could have!!) Jen‚Äôs professionalism - which permeates through her entire staff - is top notch and the Funville team‚Äôs customer service makes party day enjoyable for everyone (parents too!). The pizza that‚Äôs included as part of the birthday package is delicious - and also happens to be right next store, in case you need to add on any last minute additions. (Have I mentioned the convenience of this experience??) My husband and I were carefree from start to finish and it really changed the entire day for us - it was totally worth it. They also took care of the gift bags AND had a special gift for the birthday boy.

THANK YOU Jen and the Funville Factory team for making this such a wonderful day - and planning experience - for my family! I absolutely recommend this place for anyone with kiddos (toddlers are the sweet spot, but I feel like kids up to 7 or 8 would also have a ball). And if you‚Äôre looking for a fun space for your next event, and a professional/customer-focused staff to help you execute, you‚Äôve found your spot!

Review: Funville was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. I purchased the private event package, and the place was closed to the public for a couple of hours. My daughter could enjoy the place comfortably with her friends, and I could relax and enjoy talking to my family and friends without worrying about cleaning, serving food, or setting up the decorations. The staff did a wonderful job with the decorations and setting up the tables. My daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse-themed birthday, so the staff decorated the party room according to that theme and even had Minnie Mouse plates and utensils for the cake. They also provided goodie bags for all my daughter‚Äôs friends. My friend told me how much her two kids loved what was in the good bags. My daughter also received a Funville T-shirt, a Mickey Mouse puzzle, and a lollipop.

Also, the package includes Napoli pizzas (the pizza place is next to Funville) for your guests. This was the first time I had Napoli pizza, and I fell in love with its fresh ingredients and overall flavor! Most of my guests had their pizza for the first time and are planning a separate trip to Funville and Napoli Pizza.

Another reason to have your toddler celebrate their birthday at Funville is that parents do not have to chase after their toddler. This is because Funville is a small space, but it is packed with interactive and fun activities that will keep them occupied. It is also clean and well-maintained thanks to the staff who ensure everything is in order. I could catch up on conversations with parents and enjoy myself while knowing my daughter is playing safely with other kids.

I highly recommend this event space! Thanks, Funville!

Review: Hi Valerie,

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize if our pricing felt too high for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our pricing:

	‚Ä¢	$1 for adults: We strive to keep our prices affordable. Many indoor playgrounds charge around $4.99 for adults, or even the same amount as for children. For comparison, our family recently visited the Peppa Pig Theme Park, which charged $70 for adults despite there being no rides for adults. (It was super fun to watch our kids having a BLAST!)
	‚Ä¢	$4 for children 8 months and younger: But they play for FREE WITH A PAYING SIBLING!
	‚Ä¢	$10 for children aged 9 to 21 months: Our playground is specially designed for this age group, with plenty of toys and activities tailored to their needs.
	‚Ä¢	$16 for children aged 22 months and up: We carefully researched our pricing and can assure you that our prices are among the most competitive in Georgia.

Regarding cleanliness, I can assure you that we take this very seriously. We clean and disinfect regularly throughout the day, even if it may not always be visible. We understand that while you‚Äôre focused on watching your child, it might be easy to miss our team in action. Additionally, we don‚Äôt mop the floors during business hours to avoid soaking your socks or causing slips and falls, which is why we require socks to be worn. We are also moving our shoe rack outside the entrance to help keep socks clean and ensure a better experience for everyone.

We appreciate your input and hope to welcome you back soon.

Review: I know people love this place bc indoor spaces are much needed in our community. If you‚Äôve been and love it, I love that for you.

Our experience, I took my 2.5 yr old and my 6 month old, they charged me $15 for the 6 month old to enter. I baby wore her and she didn‚Äôt play bc.. she‚Äôs 6 months old. They said they processed a refund when I spoke up about it, but it never cleared. I didn‚Äôt report back bc I‚Äôm just over it at this point. So, we went and they had day camp going on. Everytime he wanted to get on the trampoline he was told no, it‚Äôs for camp kids. Being my kids sensory seeking is running and jumping, he didn‚Äôt get to do very much there. He doesn‚Äôt like swings, and the swings are dead center of the space. He was running between the swings bc running is one of his stims and was knocked down a few times bc of kids swinging. So it‚Äôs unsafe. There isn‚Äôt a place to run. Jumping was a no go bc it seemed solely for camp kids.

Also some of the camp kids were aggressive. One little boy kept coming up to my kid and grabbing his shirt trying to literally drag him. It scared my kid.

The water fountain area stayed wet and our socks got wet and dirty, felt gross. The bathroom floor was also wet and felt gross bc it‚Äôs a unisex bathroom so you don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs pee or water. I threw our socks away after walking away.

I feel like it could have been more, it wasn‚Äôt anything ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. Not when I have most of the things at home already with the exception of the zip line. Even the toddler toys aren‚Äôt anything unique. I expected more from all the hype.

But definitely great for older kids and kids who like swings. I think it‚Äôs a great idea to have, and wish the owners all the success. Looks like they will do great things in the special needs community .

Review: This place was really awesome! It had lots of swing options and my little loved the zip line swing. She also enjoyed playing pretend with the kitchen, makeup and quiet room spaces. We went on a Sunday afternoon so it was nice and quiet for us with just a few other people and really enjoyed it.

Review: I enrolled my child in Summer Camp at We Rock the Spectrum. Today, I was informed that my child followed a staff member out of the back door and ended up sitting in a puddle of water. This incident is extremely concerning, as it indicates a lack of adequate supervision and proper staff-to-child ratios to ensure children‚Äôs safety.

At a rate of over $300 for part-time and more than $450 for full-time enrollment ‚Äî without lunch provided ‚Äî parents should be able to expect a higher standard of care and attentiveness. Unfortunately, this has not been our experience.

Due to these safety concerns, this will be our final week at We Rock the Spectrum. I cannot recommend this program based on our experience.

Review: We Rock the Spectrum Kids Gym has been an absolute blessing for our family. As a parent of two sons with very different special needs, it‚Äôs the only place where both of my boys can truly be themselves. They‚Äôve never interacted with one another the way they do here, and I‚Äôve seen them grow in ways I never expected in just the first few visits!

This gym is a safe, welcoming space for kids of all abilities. I‚Äôve met so many amazing families who, like me, are looking for a community that understands the unique challenges of being a special needs parent. It‚Äôs not just a place for kids with special needs; neurotypical children are also part of the experience, learning to interact with and appreciate others who may have different abilities.

My kids LOVE the Zip slider! The rock wall and teen room are also a favorite. Their calming room is so adorable and perfect for when we need a break.

What I love most is their saying ‚ÄúFinally a place where you never have to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù ‚Äú. It is so very true!  My children are not only given the opportunity to play and have fun, but they‚Äôre also learning important social skills and empathy. It‚Äôs a truly inclusive space where all children, regardless of ability, can feel valued. If you‚Äôre a parent of a child with special needs, I highly recommend checking out We Rock the Spectrum Kids Gym. It‚Äôs a place where your child can thrive, and where you can find a supportive community.

Review: Finally, a place where I can feel my anxiety drop at the door because I know that everybody there understands the way I feel and my child. My daughter has been so comfortable and her needs are definitely accommodated by high-quality equipment and plenty of space that caters towards really any child. I have two toddlers and only one of them has special needs, but it‚Äôs been so much easier to keep up with them and not feel like I am inconveniencing anybody in the process. So grateful for a place like this because it reminds me there is a community just like my family. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more!

Review: My daughter loved it!! We came for the opening on Saturday and she declared it the best play place ever! The zip line, The swings, the trampoline, the craft/creative station, the calming room, and the toddler room, the teen room. Everything is perfect.
If your child is anywhere on the spectrum, you need to check this place out!! It is finally a place where, as a parent, I am not on guard watching my child play. She can be unapologetically herself. I can be unapologetically her parent and we can focus on having fun! We even bought a 12 pack to come back again!! We hope to have years of fun here.

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

Review: I recently had my daughter‚Äôs 5th birthday here and the entire experience was PHENOMENAL! The owners were extremely accommodating and worked with me from the very beginning to make my little girls birthday party one to remember. The staff the day of was extremely sweet and super attentive to all the kids at the party. The adults enjoyed not having to wonder or worry if there little one was safe and could relax in the seating area to watch the kids play. The facility was extremely clean and the entire party was organized (which is saying a lot for 15 5 year olds). I will be using Drop N Play for future parties as well as when I need a couple of hours of me time!

Review: The staff was really rude and judgmental. We were playing with the kids when they asked us to leave the play area, claiming we were hindering the children's play, which we weren't. Anyway, GiggleTown is much better. Don't waste your time coming here! Space is very tight! Also the lady is light skin who made us leave. the other two was very respectful instead of her

Review: I did my son 3rd birthday party here. It was a great place for a 3 year old at first I was scared he was too small for it but he did amazing and great. He has a younger sister that‚Äôs one 1/2 did amazing playing on everything as well so I recommend for age one as well and up. The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly. The people that help set up and helped with the kids was amazing people and friendly. Very clean environment!

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

Review: We had the absolute BEST experience hosting our little one‚Äôs first birthday at Romp-a-Roo!

From start to finish, everything was seamless, thoughtful, and beautifully executed. Audrey went above and beyond with the d√©cor‚Äîevery single detail matched our Wonderland theme perfectly. From the balloons and backdrops to the table runners and themed play areas, it truly felt like stepping into a storybook. Even our guests (yes, including the dads!) were commenting on how detailed and magical everything was!

The space was clean, safe, and full of fun‚Äîfrom a ball pit and obstacle course to interactive play stations and an inflatable bounce area. It was a dream setup that let the kids play freely while the adults relaxed and enjoyed the party. All we had to do was show up and set out the food‚Äîeverything else was handled with care and creativity.

I cannot recommend Romp-a-Roo enough for your next party or celebration. It‚Äôs rare to find a venue that feels this personal, welcoming, and well-curated. Thank you, Audrey, for making Chloe‚Äôs ONEderland celebration so incredibly special‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to return!

My kid had plenty of room to roam around and could either play alone or with other kids. Great foe different age ranges too. The price is also very reasonable.

Review: The Ark is such a fun and family friendly indoor playroom for children from infants to school age. The owners Savannah and Mac are always very welcoming, and the big boss Miss Josie is always a help with showing you around! They keep the areas clean and picked up, have tons of toys for different interests and rotate the toys from time to time to keep the children entertained and their brains moving. I visit quite frequently with the little ones I watch and refer other parents/caregivers here as well. If you are looking to beat the rain, summer heat or the cold winters or even just get out the house this is a good option. They also do events, allow birthday parties and offer play passes.  I love the ark and so do all the littles!

I don‚Äôt live locally anymore , so I don‚Äôt get to go as often as I‚Äôd like , but I never regret it when I make the drive to meet my girlfriends and their children.
Savannah and her team have always been kind and welcoming. I see them wiping down toys and maintaining the playroom throughout our time.
I‚Äôm a photographer and it‚Äôs the perfect spot to let my kids run around in a safe space while i get work done.
I highly recommend this spot to parents who need a coffee date , a safe indoor space on rainy days to get the kiddos out, or anyone who needs a space for birthday parties etc.

The ARK is a great space and I know the owners have a good heart and a passion for their small business!

I recently had a 5yo birthday party here and the rental was extremely easy and non stressful, in fact it was probably the easiest birthday party I've done between 2 kids in the last 8 years, I highly recommend it for birthday parties. The owner is very nice and down to earth, as well as everyone she has helping. Also if you are like me and wonder if your slightly older kid would enjoy, I've witnessed older elementary kids, including my own, having a blast. This is a great addition to the community!

Grocery store, diner, kitchen, tools, playhouse, doctor, doll house, super hero house, and little people area. There's a nice place for parents to sit and talk. It‚Äôs large enough that the kids have plenty of room to play and have fun, but small enough where you can see the kids while they play without having to follow them around or worry about them wandering off. The kids had a great time. They played for 3 whole hours and were not bored at all.

Edit on our second visit: I love this place. This is no fault to them but the smoke shop a few door down to impacting the smell in this place. I wasn't sure what it was on our first visit but I realized that it's the smoke from that place coming into this place. So if you're sensitive like me to smoke then maybe think twice. Maybe when they're lease is up here they can move to a better location. And in the meantime maybe they can get hepa air cleaners to try to reduce the odor.

Review: I have spent some time at the Ark with my niece. The space was clean and organized. There are many stations to for children to play with others or even with their adults. She asked me to play with her and together (with me sitting on the floor) she checked me out at the ‚Äúgrocery store‚Äù then prepared a meal to us to eat. It was so much fun; my niece and I both had a blast. The kids-centered space was a perfect retreat for the hot and muggy then stormy day. The Ark also had refreshments and was an overall friendly and safe space.

I ended up booking my daughter‚Äôs birthday party there for this weekend. It is hard to find an air conditioned space that is affordable in Mcdonough but the owner was so accommodating and helpful in making sure the party would work for us!

Review: Heard about this place on a  Facebook group. I tried to take my daughter to this location earlier this week. Unfortunately, when we got there, which took a while because it is kind of off the beaten path in McDonough, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with the outside of the building. It looks like an old, run-down industrial building with a hemp store right next to it (really?) There were no cars in the front, no real signage (a taped piece of printing paper with directions to a side door ), and no curtains open to the windows so that you could at least see into the place. I  called a couple of times To see if someone was inside, but the phone kept going to voicemail (at like 11 AM) I drove around to this mysterious door and did not feel comfortable taking my daughter in so I didn‚Äôt. IMO, this is not a professional place where you take your child. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable, Didn‚Äôt like the location, and wasn‚Äôt a fan of the non-responsiveness. There were also zero cars outside, which made me think the place wasn‚Äôt even open despite their hours being listed as open from 8 to 4. I got excited about having this kind of facility, but I realize this is not what I‚Äôm looking for. I won‚Äôt be back and won‚Äôt recommend it. Hopefully, we get an actual playroom in the area sometime in the future. Until then, go North. Don't waste your time here.

It is now my 2 year old daughter's favorite place to be. She can spend hours playing independently, or play alongside other kiddos there. Just today, we brought our breakfast to eat at the playroom, and then she played for a few hours before I had to pull her away. We have been many times, and she never tires of it. It is clean, age appropriate,  and a perfect place to relax while your little ones play. Love that they have an area for nursing mamas too.

Review: I took my five year old daughter here today and she had a blast! I definitely think it‚Äôs geared towards her age and younger. It‚Äôs a very small indoor playground, but super fun. If you‚Äôve been to a catch air it‚Äôs probably a fourth of that size. The website says 10 and under which totally makes sense, Id probably even say to go younger. I didn‚Äôt get a coffee from the cafe but I absolutely LOVE that they have that available for parents. The workers were super sweet!! This is NOT an all day pass-it‚Äôs just for two hours! It says that on the website as well, but I totally forgot and asked if we could go get lunch and re-enter, that‚Äôs a no-go!!

I took off a star because you have to take your shoes off BEFORE you enter the fun zone (makes sense) however, the two bathrooms are IN the fun zone area‚Ä¶ which means kids/adults are going into the bathroom with their socks on then playing all over the equipment in nasty bathroom socks ü§¢ that is so so unsanitary and spreads horrible germs and bacteria everywhere. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to change this, looking at the layout.

When I took them a few weeks ago obviously I had to resign the waiver and everything which was fine! This time we had to actually pay for socks for each of us,  and I was totally okay with that. After everything was filled out and sock sizes were done she said cash or card and mind you I had my 5 year old and 2 year old by myself because my husband was working.. I politely asked how much it would be because it‚Äôs all three of us and the lady looked at me in a concerning way saying oh it‚Äôs $47 and that honestly rubbed me the wrong way. The look she gave me was oh can you afford it, and that is a hurt no mother shouldn‚Äôt ever feel trying to take her kids to play and have a good time.. The remodel is so good and you should definitely check it out but with the way I felt I‚Äôm not sure if I feel comfortable going back, but that is also just my experience.

Review: We drive over half an hour to get here regularly and have been loyal customers for years now. My 10 year and 4 year old daughters have been going to this place at least once/twice a month for years. We arrived today and were turned away since they ‚Äúchanged the ages to 8 and under at beginning of the year‚Äù but we‚Äôve never been turned away before. So apparently they just pick and choose when they want to enforce this rule, because they didn‚Äôt have a problem taking my money the last 11 months of this year. Keep in mind, we have to do waivers at least once a year, so they knew my 10 year old was not 8 or underü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è highly unprofessional to pick and choose when to enforce rules that are not even posted in store nor made known at sign up.

Review: We first went here to scope out places for our son's 2nd birthday. After walking around and seeing how clean and safe the facility was, we were sold. I was very impressed with the friendliness and follow through for his party. I got a phone call a week before to confirm everything, clarify instructions for myself and guests on the day of. I can't tell you how stress-free they attempted to make everything for me. All of our guests were impressed with the cleanliness of the facility. We were all thoroughly impressed with the fact that everything was safe enough to let them run and play, while at the same time being sturdy enough for us adults to play on it with them. We cannot wait to come back and play!

Also the party rooms are excellent for little kids to sit, and I was amazed they had a fridge in each one. The only drawback was there was not a lot of room for adults to sit in the party room, but they were fine sitting out in the tables outside the party room.

Thank you again for all your help making our special day amazing!

Review: I have not been to many indoor playgrounds, but I do return to this one often. They have equipment to entertane small babies to young teenagers. Kids can romp and play pretty freely without endangering each other. There is a Diner here within easy access of the play area. Food is at a typical expense. There is a reasonable selection of drinks, snacks and desserts.

I have had a few objections that they seem to be addressing, which is awesome. At this point, I am only concerned with one gate that the kids can easily get out of and it gets a little difficult to keep track of them when it get busy. There are play areas out of sight. Parents usually look out for each other's kids so I don't get too nervous about it. There are two separate entrances/exits. One stays locked and the other has an employee manning it the majority of the time. So I would say it is reasonably secure. But I would recommend that you keep a vigil just in case.

My three kids love it here and they range from 2 to 4 years of age. They have yet to get hurt here and they meet lots of other kids and get plenty of exercise.  They are usually worn out by the time they get in the car.

Check it out, it is worth the trip.

Review: My daughter is One years old, but because she is a few months past 12 months old I was charged a higher price and shouldn‚Äôt have been. She is One not two or a different age, according to the signs etc, one is different price. (Edited) I did let the woman know at the counter about the price and was told no Because she is not exactly one. When I‚Äôm fast my daughter is one. So let me get this straight it‚Äôs exactly 12 months? That doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. It was also over crowded for the size of the space when we went :( way too many parties at once.

Review: I like the old management as well as the new. The food is a bit pricey, but good, the pizza cost almost $5 for one slice. If they knock the price down a bit I would have considered an extra slice of pizza. I like the different flavored slushie drinks they have. They had apple cider slushie freeze around November. I like that they added new things to keep the kids entertained, like the dinosaur bouncy and more arcades, even picnic table outside. The place is clean, the manager and owner is very nice. I would really like the teens to engage more with keeping the play areas safe.

Review: The play equipment seemed clean and well maintained. The carpet was maybe a little yuck, but I think a certain amount of grubbiness is to be expected when you have kids running around all the time. A lot of the arcade equipment didn't work or was in disrepair though, which was disappointing and why I didn't rate 5 stars.

Review: I'd love to give it 5-stars, but my son ended up getting hurt. It's a wonderful place to play up for the younger kids to burn off energy and zip around, until older kids slip in. (Birthday parties or whatever) Kids definitely older than 12. Ended up getting into the bounce house knock him around and almost landing on his head scaring him causing him to cry. I told a worker he was genuinely concerned and said he would keep an eye open and let others know. We left soon after because more older kids definitely older than 12 joined in and knocking the littles over. Besides those moments it's a wonderful place!

Review: I really enjoy Playland. My kids are 1 and 3 and are able to have a great time here. They have a few good food options and some games. But the main bounce house/playground sets are awesome. Much cleaner looking than they use to be.

I can only give 4 stars because they desperately need someone to enforce the 3 year old area from older kids on busy nights. My daughter couldn‚Äôt go in the bounce area several times due to 6/7 year old boys rough housing in it and negligent parents who don‚Äôt know what their kids are doing. Beyond that, it is great.

Some more outdoor lighting for their parking a bit away from their building would be great, too.

Review: Super fun! My 1¬Ω year old twins loved the toddler area. The kiddie bounce house was a huge hit, as was the car tracks. Older kids loved the bounce house obstacle course and free bounce. The arcade was small, but my boys got tons of tickets and cool prizes. It was definitely fun and felt safer than a traditional outdoor playground for my littlest ones. I probably wouldn't brave it solo with my twins because they're feral, but if you've got a brood of well behaved Littles this would be a good snowy day activity

Review: They now require ADULTS to remove their shoes.  I didn't have socks for myself and couldn't walk around to interact with my child which was a bummer.  They replaced the foam flooring in the play area and updated the look of the snack bar.  Now $12 for one hour of bounce per child over 3 years old. I've been coming here with my child since 2019 and overall its a very fun place to take kids and we've had a lot of good memories here.  I personally love the current layout with the swingsets included! The basketball arcade game was out of order which is one of our favorites :(

Review: I feel the concept of the place is cool, but the playground area is rather unimpressive. A good amount of space is taken up by the ""toddler area"", only for those up to 3yrs. And the playsets are similar as well. Parents aren't allowed on attractions.
However, the glow in dark mini golf is cool. The designs are pirates, dinos, and knights (so no girly items). But you can't dislike mini-golf.

Review: We only come here for my friend's kids birthday since we live out of state... I don't understand the purpose of having rules if you aren't going to enforce them. Parents don't actually pay attention to their children and when their kids push, smack and body slam others kids they want to act like their kid is innocent when the parent of the child pushed corrects their child. Kids with no socks, parents with shoes on in areas where it clearly says no shoes. Drinks in the toddler area fully visible so either cleaning wasn't done or it's not that important. Everytime I saw a staff member they were on their phones. when we first got there they had children vacuuming the carpets.

Review: I went back and forth on a 2 star or 3 star. Truth is, they have A LOT for kids to play on. We took our toddler and he enjoyed the toys to climb on. That said, this play is incredibly dirty, and you can smell the dirt (if that makes sense). I watched an employee come through with an aerosol can and spray as he walked through. It made me chuckle.

We live in Michigan and have a couple other options and we will use those because this place was too dirty for us.

Your kids will have fun, just prepare yourself for the environment.

Review: Love this place, I take my child regularly on the weekends. Staff is great always see someone walking around cleaning areas. Unfortunately yesterday I did witness an argument between a staff member and a parent. The mother was screaming and putting her hands in the workers face. From what I got from it, it was because her child couldn't go on the big slide. I witness the work coming over and politely remind the mom her child was too small for the slide, then the mother started screaming and putting her hand in the workers face, the worker did  yell back at the parent then walked away. About 15 minutes after that I witness the same parent go  to the employee and told her to take it outside and fight. This is so sad that grown people need to act like this around kids. The worker walked away and management talked to the parent. I feel bad for these workers especially the teenagers that have to deal with people like this. I will continue to bring my child as the staff has always been nice and the place is always clean.

Review: I was there today and witnessed an altercation between a mother with her child on her hip and a female manager that was in her 50's. I was extremely shock at how the manager got into the mothers face with her child on her hip and screaming at this poor mother. She also made the child cry and scared my 2 kids as well. That was very uncalled for and I can't believe how the manager was acting in front of parents and their children. So sad that a grown 50 year old manager would act like that not only in public but around children of different ages. We pay good money to bring our children here to have fun. Not to be screamed at with your small kid on your hip by an old lady that is grown and should not be acting like that. Oh yeah to top it all off the manager called the women ""White Trash"". This old lady should be fire on the spot. Well this will be the first and last time I take my children there. Oh yeah I forgot to mention that there where birthday parties going on as well that seen the craziness. DO NOT RECOMEND GOING HERE.  And the only reason why there is one star is because I can't post this without a star.

Review: Sylvania Playland is a great place to take the kids to burn off some energy, especially on those cold winter and hot summer days in the heated / air conditioned indoor space. The kids love running around and playing on the inflateables, bounce houses, swings, slides, etc.

I would say that 1 hour isn't quite enough time, but 2 hours will help your kids sleep well when they get home. You might as well spend the extra couple bucks to get the unlimited play.

There is a 3 and under area for the small children that my 1-year-old loves. The big slide is a hit with my 4-year-old!

There are several party rooms, so this is a great place to have a birthday party for your children. They run around for an hour, eat for a little bit, and then go back to playing for the rest of the 2-hour window. You can bring your own decorations or use the ones that Sylvania Playland provides. They have pizza for the attendees and other add-on options.

They also have mini-golf, but we haven't done that part of Playland yet. In addition, there is a little arcade and an ice cream shop.

I highly recommend Sylvania Playland for parents with kids who are under 12 for a very fun experience.

Review: I've taken my toddler here several times. It's wonderful to have a place to take a child when the weather is not nice. The reason I am giving a 2 star review and not a five is because of cleanliness issues and broken toys. I usually go at opening as I would expect it to be cleaner, but I still find myself with a layer of grime on my hands after one hour of play. The last time I went there in the afternoon my child picked up a virus. Great concept but fails on execution.

Review: The only reason I‚Äôm giving 2 stars is because my babies had fun and want to come back. I would have gave 5 stars but my main issue is the cleanliness. I understand it‚Äôs a kids place so germs are to be expected and so forth but their entrance carpet I noticeably dirty. There was caked up dirty on the inside of the little toys in the toddler section. Again, I expect missed opportunities but when something is caked up, it hasn‚Äôt been clean in quite some time. I wiped a crusted booger off on the handle of one car. The padding of the toddler area is very dirty. They either need to clean it or replace it‚Ä¶ which is inexpensive. They should also ensure the adults are not wearing shoes in the area, that could prevent the filth in the toddler play area. The friendliness of the staff at the front counter could be better but since you don‚Äôt have to really interact with them, it‚Äôs not a big deal. On a lighter note, the restroom was clean.

Oh, it‚Äôs spacious and you can throw birthdays there.

Review: This is toddler heaven! My one year old loved it immediately, and we signed up for a membership the first day. Normally at home she is really clingy to me, but she is so entertained by everything here, she plays independently for hours. It's a nice space for parents to chat with each other or to chill by yourself. Free wifi works well (and is allowing me to write this review on my computer right now!) The ladies who work here are super kind and friendly with the kids and are on impressively top of disinfecting and tidying. They literally follow the kids around and clean up after them the entire time. (If only they would follow me around in my life and clean up after me!!) Normally we go to the library, but with cold season coming up, it's worth paying to play in a clean environment. Not to mention WAY more things to play with. I really hope local families will take advantage of this amazing play space. We are lucky to have a safe, clean, community for our little ones, and I hope they get enough support to keep doing what they're doing!

Review: 5+ stars for The Funville Factory! A lovely venue. Safe, clean, and the perfect place to host your child's birthday party. We did my daughter's 4th birthday there this past weekend and everything was perfect. Jen (the owner) is awesome. So sweet, reliable and responsive. She wants everything to be easy and perfect for you as the busy parent. The rest of her staff is also so beyond sweet. Everyone had a BLAST! Also, the pizza they get from next store is really yummy (antico style) not just ""regular pizza."" The type of play stuff they have is really good for ranges of ages so my daughter and most of her friends are 4 but there were siblings there older and younger that all had things to be occupied with. We did the 3 hour galaxy package to have the place to ourselves, so worth it. 3 hours of play time is VERY generous!! Overall 10/10 experience. Wouldn't change a thing!!<3<3<3<3

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs fourth birthday at Funville Factory and it could not have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived, the owners were right there welcoming us and helping set everything up, making sure we had everything we needed. They even accommodated us with juice boxes, the cutest Super Kitties themed plates, and a pile of stickers that the kids went crazy over.

The place itself is a little smaller than some of the bigger indoor playgrounds, but honestly that was a huge plus. There was so much variety packed into the space with swings, slides, pretend houses, and climbing areas, and because it was cozy, it was easy to keep an eye on all the kids without feeling overwhelmed. The owners were constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy and calmly stepping in if two kids looked like they might get into a squabble. It felt so safe and thoughtfully run.

The party room looked amazing when we walked in, like a mini Super Kitties world made just for our daughter. They paid attention to every little detail, making sure every child had a seat, plenty of juice, and a stack of stickers to take home. It made the whole party feel really special and personal.

Funville Factory is perfect for younger kids, especially around two to six years old. It seems like they do not really accept kids older than six, which honestly makes sense because the space is so perfectly tailored for the little ones. If you have a four-year-old like we do, this place feels like a dream.

What really stood out the most was how personally involved the owners were the entire time. They were not just running the place, they were making sure our daughter and all her friends were having the best time. We could not have asked for a better experience and we will definitely be back.

Review: I‚Äôm a nanny for two sweet little girls ages 1 and 2 . I originally was going to have a friend with me to help take the girls to a park or something because it‚Äôs hard to take them places by myself. Our plans fell through but I really wanted the girls to have an adventure. So I searched indoor places and stumbled upon this place! So We went Last Friday in the evening and at first I was hesitant with the prices but I decided to give them a shot! And I‚Äôm sooo glad I did!! The pricing makes so much sense once you are in there! They have lots of toys and jungle gym type things for toddlers to play on! It‚Äôs super clean in there, even with it being a place for toddlers the germs are always everywhere. But the staff was frequently cleaning and watching over the kids so the parents or nanny ,like my self , can feel at ease and not have to be a Helicopter. MAJOR PLUS! They also have these cute slippers that you wear to go to the restrooms so your feet aren‚Äôt touching the bathroom floor! Lastly in the front they have snacks, more toys and gagets for the kids either free or a low price! Overall, me and the girls will Definitely be back! And thank you Funville for making our experience peaceful and fun!

This is a small business and the owner is super kind and personable. She really does enjoy children. The place is very clean. They sanitize constantly. My daughter never gets sick from here like other indoor play areas. It‚Äôs a great place to come anytime but it has been a life saver during cold rainy weather as well. They do parents night out which has been amazing. My daughter will not go to anyone but she will go to the owner at Funville. They also have lots of special events such as reading or arts and crafts. I highly recommend this place for just playing and for birthday parties. It was one of the best parties we held.

Not only is this place suited for kids under 6, the staff does an incredible job of keeping the place clean and organized. An impressive feat with a bunch of 1&2 year olds running around.

I also had the chance to speak with the owner, and she takes cleanliness, safety, and overall experience very seriously while being incredibly personable.

I highly recommend Funville for any parents wanting a safe, fun place for their little!

Review: This place seems like a lot of fun for kids, has lots to play with, is clean and well-maintained, and has reasonable prices.

However, the two times I‚Äôve been there‚Äìweekday afternoons‚Äìit‚Äôs been uncomfortably crowded. They also have a fair bit of clutter from the toy kitchen, puzzles, train station, etc. that ends up littering the whole area.

Between the overcrowding and the clutter, my one-year-old was terribly overstimulated after an hour and a half each time we visited. He had trouble falling asleep‚Äìwent to bed well over an hour late‚Äìafter both of our visits. We get out and about doing toddler things most days and that‚Äôs never happened anywhere else, so for me that really highlights how overstimulating it is here.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun place for lots of kids, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a great environment for mine.

I couldn't even have imagined one could be so nice until a friend brought me here. The colors are pastel and soothing, they play classical music, and the staff wipes down and tidies constantly throughout all the stations. They have stations for fine motor and gross motor skills. You just don't see overstimulated children, like the other ones. I love this place and will continue driving here from Brookhaven. The owner is really awesome too!

Review: We stumbled across Funville earlier this summer (thank you OTP Mama for the tip!) It quickly became a favorite play spot for our toddler and was a life savor for us on those grueling hot summer days.

The place is AMAZING - with all sorts of toys/sensory exploration/playground fun you need to keep a toddler (or crew of toddlers!) entertained for hours on end. They also offer various packages - that you can take advantage of through their membership OR NOT. (I personally appreciate that flexibility in a membership/subscription dominant world) Of course they have birthday party packages, and we just hosted our son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect - but it was an amazing day that went off without a hitch. The owner, Jen, went above and beyond with the decorations. All I had to do was share the number of attendees and theme, and she took care of the rest (‚Ä¶and had it decorated better than I ever could have!!) Jen‚Äôs professionalism - which permeates through her entire staff - is top notch and the Funville team‚Äôs customer service makes party day enjoyable for everyone (parents too!). The pizza that‚Äôs included as part of the birthday package is delicious - and also happens to be right next store, in case you need to add on any last minute additions. (Have I mentioned the convenience of this experience??) My husband and I were carefree from start to finish and it really changed the entire day for us - it was totally worth it. They also took care of the gift bags AND had a special gift for the birthday boy.

THANK YOU Jen and the Funville Factory team for making this such a wonderful day - and planning experience - for my family! I absolutely recommend this place for anyone with kiddos (toddlers are the sweet spot, but I feel like kids up to 7 or 8 would also have a ball). And if you‚Äôre looking for a fun space for your next event, and a professional/customer-focused staff to help you execute, you‚Äôve found your spot!

Review: Funville was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. I purchased the private event package, and the place was closed to the public for a couple of hours. My daughter could enjoy the place comfortably with her friends, and I could relax and enjoy talking to my family and friends without worrying about cleaning, serving food, or setting up the decorations. The staff did a wonderful job with the decorations and setting up the tables. My daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse-themed birthday, so the staff decorated the party room according to that theme and even had Minnie Mouse plates and utensils for the cake. They also provided goodie bags for all my daughter‚Äôs friends. My friend told me how much her two kids loved what was in the good bags. My daughter also received a Funville T-shirt, a Mickey Mouse puzzle, and a lollipop.

Also, the package includes Napoli pizzas (the pizza place is next to Funville) for your guests. This was the first time I had Napoli pizza, and I fell in love with its fresh ingredients and overall flavor! Most of my guests had their pizza for the first time and are planning a separate trip to Funville and Napoli Pizza.

Another reason to have your toddler celebrate their birthday at Funville is that parents do not have to chase after their toddler. This is because Funville is a small space, but it is packed with interactive and fun activities that will keep them occupied. It is also clean and well-maintained thanks to the staff who ensure everything is in order. I could catch up on conversations with parents and enjoy myself while knowing my daughter is playing safely with other kids.

I highly recommend this event space! Thanks, Funville!

Review: We recently went to Funville for a playdate with a friend. Our 2 year olds had such an amazing time to the point they passed out in the car driving home. The inside is clean and has an enriching environment for young minds to experience grocery shopping or running a restaurant.  My son and his playdate enjoyed feeding us ice cream . My older son didn't feel left out as he traveled through their obstacle course and pretended to be a construction worker.  We even met a new family who was celebrating their daughters 3 birthday. It was a wonderful experience and we will be back .

Thanks Jen for your hospitality.

Review: Hi Valerie,

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize if our pricing felt too high for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our pricing:

	‚Ä¢	$1 for adults: We strive to keep our prices affordable. Many indoor playgrounds charge around $4.99 for adults, or even the same amount as for children. For comparison, our family recently visited the Peppa Pig Theme Park, which charged $70 for adults despite there being no rides for adults. (It was super fun to watch our kids having a BLAST!)
	‚Ä¢	$4 for children 8 months and younger: But they play for FREE WITH A PAYING SIBLING!
	‚Ä¢	$10 for children aged 9 to 21 months: Our playground is specially designed for this age group, with plenty of toys and activities tailored to their needs.
	‚Ä¢	$16 for children aged 22 months and up: We carefully researched our pricing and can assure you that our prices are among the most competitive in Georgia.

Regarding cleanliness, I can assure you that we take this very seriously. We clean and disinfect regularly throughout the day, even if it may not always be visible. We understand that while you‚Äôre focused on watching your child, it might be easy to miss our team in action. Additionally, we don‚Äôt mop the floors during business hours to avoid soaking your socks or causing slips and falls, which is why we require socks to be worn. We are also moving our shoe rack outside the entrance to help keep socks clean and ensure a better experience for everyone.

We appreciate your input and hope to welcome you back soon.

Review: 5+ stars for The Funville Factory! A lovely venue. Safe, clean, and the perfect place to host your child's birthday party. We did my daughter's 4th birthday there this past weekend and everything was perfect. Jen (the owner) is awesome. So sweet, reliable and responsive. She wants everything to be easy and perfect for you as the busy parent. The rest of her staff is also so beyond sweet. Everyone had a BLAST! Also, the pizza they get from next store is really yummy (antico style) not just ""regular pizza."" The type of play stuff they have is really good for ranges of ages so my daughter and most of her friends are 4 but there were siblings there older and younger that all had things to be occupied with. We did the 3 hour galaxy package to have the place to ourselves, so worth it. 3 hours of play time is VERY generous!! Overall 10/10 experience. Wouldn't change a thing!!<3<3<3<3

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs fourth birthday at Funville Factory and it could not have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived, the owners were right there welcoming us and helping set everything up, making sure we had everything we needed. They even accommodated us with juice boxes, the cutest Super Kitties themed plates, and a pile of stickers that the kids went crazy over.

The place itself is a little smaller than some of the bigger indoor playgrounds, but honestly that was a huge plus. There was so much variety packed into the space with swings, slides, pretend houses, and climbing areas, and because it was cozy, it was easy to keep an eye on all the kids without feeling overwhelmed. The owners were constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy and calmly stepping in if two kids looked like they might get into a squabble. It felt so safe and thoughtfully run.

The party room looked amazing when we walked in, like a mini Super Kitties world made just for our daughter. They paid attention to every little detail, making sure every child had a seat, plenty of juice, and a stack of stickers to take home. It made the whole party feel really special and personal.

Funville Factory is perfect for younger kids, especially around two to six years old. It seems like they do not really accept kids older than six, which honestly makes sense because the space is so perfectly tailored for the little ones. If you have a four-year-old like we do, this place feels like a dream.

What really stood out the most was how personally involved the owners were the entire time. They were not just running the place, they were making sure our daughter and all her friends were having the best time. We could not have asked for a better experience and we will definitely be back.

I originally was going to have a friend with me to help take the girls to a park or something because it‚Äôs hard to take them places by myself. Our plans fell through but I really wanted the girls to have an adventure. So I searched indoor places and stumbled upon this place! So We went Last Friday in the evening and at first I was hesitant with the prices but I decided to give them a shot! And I‚Äôm sooo glad I did!! The pricing makes so much sense once you are in there! They have lots of toys and jungle gym type things for toddlers to play on! It‚Äôs super clean in there, even with it being a place for toddlers the germs are always everywhere. But the staff was frequently cleaning and watching over the kids so the parents or nanny ,like my self , can feel at ease and not have to be a Helicopter. MAJOR PLUS! They also have these cute slippers that you wear to go to the restrooms so your feet aren‚Äôt touching the bathroom floor! Lastly in the front they have snacks, more toys and gagets for the kids either free or a low price! Overall, me and the girls will Definitely be back! And thank you Funville for making our experience peaceful and fun!

Not only is this place suited for kids under 6, the staff does an incredible job of keeping the place clean and organized. An impressive feat with a bunch of 1&2 year olds running around.

Review: We came here for my daughters 2nd birthday party and she absolutely loved it! I love it, clean, nice staff. We booked for a birthday party and it came with pizza, juice boxes, and water for the guest. Prices are great and worth its. I love the fact my daughter was able to play with kids around her age and not be ran over by older kids. I will definitely be coming back and I stay a hour away.

Review: This place seems like a lot of fun for kids, has lots to play with, is clean and well-maintained, and has reasonable prices.

However, the two times I‚Äôve been there‚Äìweekday afternoons‚Äìit‚Äôs been uncomfortably crowded. They also have a fair bit of clutter from the toy kitchen, puzzles, train station, etc. that ends up littering the whole area.

Between the overcrowding and the clutter, my one-year-old was terribly overstimulated after an hour and a half each time we visited. He had trouble falling asleep‚Äìwent to bed well over an hour late‚Äìafter both of our visits. We get out and about doing toddler things most days and that‚Äôs never happened anywhere else, so for me that really highlights how overstimulating it is here.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun place for lots of kids, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a great environment for mine.

It is the perfect size for kids to explore without feeling overwhelmed, and parents can easily supervise from almost anywhere in the facility.

The entire space is consistently spotless, providing me with a lot of peace of mind.

The staff is very friendly and attentive, which enhances the overall experience.

They also offer party events and ""Parents' Night Out""!

We have a fantastic time every time we visit.

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean, fun, and well-managed space for children!

Review: We signed up online for our toddler twins for the 4-6PM slot, we arrived at 4:23 after a 30 minute drive to get there. We were shown the door even though we had reservations for being late (??). No mention of the website of a grace period or requirement to be there with 15 minutes of the reservation time. Really bizarre. Our kids were hysterical since they didn‚Äôt get to go in after seeing the place and us getting them excited. Poorly run and wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Go to catch air instead.

For the price of the package and add on decor I think we got a great deal! The staff is very friendly and easy to work with and we did not feel rushed or pushed to leave at the end of our time slot.

Review: This is the nicest indoor playground we found in the Atlanta area. I frequent quite a few of these with my 2 yo on rainy days and birth parties. I couldn't even have imagined one could be so nice until a friend brought me here. The colors are pastel and soothing, they play classical music, and the staff wipes down and tidies constantly throughout all the stations. They have stations for fine motor and gross motor skills. You just don't see overstimulated children, like the other ones. I love this place and will continue driving here from Brookhaven. The owner is really awesome too! My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves

It is always clean, and the staff is always friendly.  It was a no-brainer to book there for my son's Halloween-themed 5th birthday.  They handled setup, balloons, decor, plates, plasticware, napkins, ordering pizza, cutting and passing out cake, gift bags, cleanup--really everything except supplying the cake.  And it was all so CUTE! We just showed up and enjoyed. Highly recommend and will definitely be back.

Review: We stumbled across Funville earlier this summer (thank you OTP Mama for the tip!) It quickly became a favorite play spot for our toddler and was a life savor for us on those grueling hot summer days.

The place is AMAZING - with all sorts of toys/sensory exploration/playground fun you need to keep a toddler (or crew of toddlers!) entertained for hours on end. They also offer various packages - that you can take advantage of through their membership OR NOT. (I personally appreciate that flexibility in a membership/subscription dominant world) Of course they have birthday party packages, and we just hosted our son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect - but it was an amazing day that went off without a hitch. The owner, Jen, went above and beyond with the decorations. All I had to do was share the number of attendees and theme, and she took care of the rest (‚Ä¶and had it decorated better than I ever could have!!) Jen‚Äôs professionalism - which permeates through her entire staff - is top notch and the Funville team‚Äôs customer service makes party day enjoyable for everyone (parents too!). The pizza that‚Äôs included as part of the birthday package is delicious - and also happens to be right next store, in case you need to add on any last minute additions. (Have I mentioned the convenience of this experience??) My husband and I were carefree from start to finish and it really changed the entire day for us - it was totally worth it. They also took care of the gift bags AND had a special gift for the birthday boy.

THANK YOU Jen and the Funville Factory team for making this such a wonderful day - and planning experience - for my family! I absolutely recommend this place for anyone with kiddos (toddlers are the sweet spot, but I feel like kids up to 7 or 8 would also have a ball). And if you‚Äôre looking for a fun space for your next event, and a professional/customer-focused staff to help you execute, you‚Äôve found your spot!

Review: Funville was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. I purchased the private event package, and the place was closed to the public for a couple of hours. My daughter could enjoy the place comfortably with her friends, and I could relax and enjoy talking to my family and friends without worrying about cleaning, serving food, or setting up the decorations. The staff did a wonderful job with the decorations and setting up the tables. My daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse-themed birthday, so the staff decorated the party room according to that theme and even had Minnie Mouse plates and utensils for the cake. They also provided goodie bags for all my daughter‚Äôs friends. My friend told me how much her two kids loved what was in the good bags. My daughter also received a Funville T-shirt, a Mickey Mouse puzzle, and a lollipop.

Also, the package includes Napoli pizzas (the pizza place is next to Funville) for your guests. This was the first time I had Napoli pizza, and I fell in love with its fresh ingredients and overall flavor! Most of my guests had their pizza for the first time and are planning a separate trip to Funville and Napoli Pizza.

Another reason to have your toddler celebrate their birthday at Funville is that parents do not have to chase after their toddler. This is because Funville is a small space, but it is packed with interactive and fun activities that will keep them occupied. It is also clean and well-maintained thanks to the staff who ensure everything is in order. I could catch up on conversations with parents and enjoy myself while knowing my daughter is playing safely with other kids.

I highly recommend this event space! Thanks, Funville!

My older son didn't feel left out as he traveled through their obstacle course and pretended to be a construction worker.  We even met a new family who was celebrating their daughters 3 birthday. It was a wonderful experience and we will be back .

Review: Hi Valerie,

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize if our pricing felt too high for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our pricing:

	‚Ä¢	$1 for adults: We strive to keep our prices affordable. Many indoor playgrounds charge around $4.99 for adults, or even the same amount as for children. For comparison, our family recently visited the Peppa Pig Theme Park, which charged $70 for adults despite there being no rides for adults. (It was super fun to watch our kids having a BLAST!)
	‚Ä¢	$4 for children 8 months and younger: But they play for FREE WITH A PAYING SIBLING!
	‚Ä¢	$10 for children aged 9 to 21 months: Our playground is specially designed for this age group, with plenty of toys and activities tailored to their needs.
	‚Ä¢	$16 for children aged 22 months and up: We carefully researched our pricing and can assure you that our prices are among the most competitive in Georgia.

Regarding cleanliness, I can assure you that we take this very seriously. We clean and disinfect regularly throughout the day, even if it may not always be visible. We understand that while you‚Äôre focused on watching your child, it might be easy to miss our team in action. Additionally, we don‚Äôt mop the floors during business hours to avoid soaking your socks or causing slips and falls, which is why we require socks to be worn. We are also moving our shoe rack outside the entrance to help keep socks clean and ensure a better experience for everyone.

We appreciate your input and hope to welcome you back soon.

Review: There are chairs and little tables, but you are not allowed to use them while your kid is playing even though you can see your child the whole time. There are no other seats for you to sit on so you were just standing there the entire time.

Review: With recommendations from my friends who are also young moms, I reserved a Small Party Package for my daughter's first birthday party. My daughter seemed to have fun as well as the other guests, but when seated in the room, the party attendant and manager kept coming in and giving time updates very frequently. 2 hours, 1 and a half hours, one hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, and 7 minutes. Her party was extremely small, and it was mostly other adults there, so I found the constant updates unnecessary. Everyone was informed about the timeline by myself before the party even started, and we honestly just felt rushed. At one point, my sister had to stop a random child who had come into the room and started digging into goodie bags. As someone who has worked in a children's play place before, I understand that timeliness and organization are important, but between the lack of compassion and the overcommunication, I don't think we will be returning.

Review: The jungle gym part really should be brighter. My little was often scared and intimidated  her but not at other similar play areas and I think it has to do with the dim lighting. The toys are often broken and missing parts.

Also very cold, I always double up on socks and wear a coat.

But my 2.5 yr old has fun and it's great when it's raining.

Review: Weird and rude policy they trying to make money from parents, this is gonna last time I take my kid here is did not worth the money. We stop here at Sunday at 4 pm and pay for 23 dollars only for 1 and a half hours play they ask us to get out at 5:30 , I have to pay more 10 dollars to extend until 7:30 . Is WEIRD OVER WERD when u get over charge and no worth it so why on Google they said they open from 9 am to 7:30 pm . I believe other play ground don‚Äôt have this policy, what ever u get in until the time they close u need to get out. Don‚Äôt come here to many time frame will make u confused and uncomfortable. Are u going to pay $23 dollars for your kid play only 1:30 hours???

Review: This place sounds like a fantastic spot for families with kids! The variety of activities are plentiful enough to keep everyone entertained, from the little ones (ages 0-9 are specifically mentioned, including a baby slide!) to the grown-ups who enjoy joining in.

The practical aspects also get a thumbs-up. The facility is noted for its cleanliness, including the restrooms, which is always a big plus. Safety also appears to be a priority, with the padded surfaces. The staff are nice and efficient, contributing to a positive experience.

A couple of helpful tips emerge : remember to wear socks and bring cash if you're interested in the video games or claw machines. Visiting during lunchtime on a weekday seems to be a good strategy if you prefer a quieter atmosphere, likely due to school being in session.

Overall, this place seems like a winner for families looking for a fun, clean, and safe environment to spend quality time together. It's definitely earning repeat visits!

Review: They make you scan a QR code for a waiver to do on your phone even though they have paper copies available to fill out. This is the only indoor play place in this area so we came here bc we have no other choices and it‚Äôs wet outside‚Ä¶ but they charge the adults to enter, and they require the adults to wear socks as well so I just sent my kid in and waited at the front bc this is frustrating and I have never been charged at an indoor kid place before. I‚Äôm not paying $5 to wait ten feet closer. Not only all of this but it‚Äôs as small as a daycare so I don‚Äôt understand the upcharging, the ball pit is tiny, the entire play area is 30 ft by 16. WackyTacky is 10x better. Should‚Äôve just gone to a trampoline place instead tbh.

Review: 1. Neglect of management. There will be older children entering the 0-2 year old kindergarten area, but the management staff don't care at all. Other taller slides say that adults are not allowed to enter, but there are still adults going in to be with the children, and there are no staff to stop them.
2. The sanitary condition is not very good. The foam splicing boards on the floor are a little dirty and the air is not good.
3. Many toys are very worn and feel older than second-hand toys.

Review: We celebrated our daughter's 1st birthday at Kidtopia. I forgot the gentleman's name who was assigned to help us on 7/19/24 at 1:30 but he was awesome! He had the room already set up for us and he frequently checked in with us to see if we needed any help. I brought my own decorations and portable freezer for a DIY sundae bar which turned out perfect! Another pro was that it was less crowded on a Friday afternoon. A few con's was that the communication via email before the party was unresponsive and the water bottles provided in the package are mini sized. It was 94 degrees the day of our party so luckily they had the AC on. I'm not sure why the company would skimp on the water bottles...it seems they would still make a profit by providing 10 regular sized water bottles. Overall, it was a chill party, I would recommend it and do it again!

Adding to our distress, we were charged a $50 cleaning fee. Considering the cleanliness of the place was already subpar, it seems unjustified to impose such a fee for merely wiping up.

Review: This place was very fun for the kids and is larger than many other indoor play places that we have visited. The only gripe I have with those place is that many of the things to climb on aremt well.maintained and you can feel.the wood underneath the foam and it hurts to climb on top of things. Also, the arcade inside is very expensive with many of the games being a dollar to play.

Review: I want to give them more stars but they are not exactly customer friendly and looks like they don‚Äôt trust the customers.

We purchased their loyalty card for $165 which covers 10 visits.  Unfortunately after 3 visits we lost the card.   We let them know but they just refused to honor the purchased service or do a replacement so that we can complete the remaining visits.    It seems they think we are trying to scam them by lying. They just dont have any respect towards the customers.

We registered a complaint with BBB, but when BBB contacted Kidtopia they didnt give any response so the complaint was closed.

Its a pity but we can‚Äôt bring ourselves to visit the place in future for play or party.  We started going to Jump n‚Äôplay in Union City, where they atleast treat customers with some respect.

They were so dingy looking. I literally felt like my socks would get dirty. There were a bunch of popped balloons on the ground, all of the toys were dirty looking. I never seen any staff walking around to tidy up. Also the birthday room was super plain, white walls dirty and looked like it hadn't been swept or mopped in a while . Absolutely no effort put into it by staff. Plexiglass was super thin and looked like if a kid jumped on it hard enough it would break. Definitely a hazard for children and we will never step our foot in there again.  B E W A R E

Review: Brought our 8 year old here for his birthday. Spent a little over an hour. It was a Sunday afternoon, not too busy...overall, the play was great, ideal for kids 10 and under. The photos made it seem like a big place but it isn't. The ventilation isn't too good, lots of different odors circulating throughout the facility. It would have been a 4 star rating; however, we felt that the woman vacuuming the playset while the kids were playing was really unnecessary.  She was walking around with a handheld vacuum collecting spider webs and dust, maybe! She couldn't have done that prior to opening? Super strange and she was rude, not one smile.

Review: We came here on a rainy day - we were in that area and searched an indoor play area and this came up in my search. We arrived at 3:30pm - there are 2 hour play slots through the day. Each 2 hour slot was $16.00 (plus $3 if you wanted to get their socks, you don't have to) so we only had 1 hour to play. We could either decide to stay for the hour or wait for the 5 o'clock hour to start. We decided to stay for the one hour and when I was going to pay she asked me are you coming back at five? I said I'm not sure do I have to pay for both slots. To my Surprise I didn't if I stayed for one hour she would prorate my time and give me a discount which I found amazing. Or she could give me wristband so I can come back at five, which I thought was amazing as well! Both options were great! The play area had so many different variety of games and structures and slides. They also have an area with arcades.arcades. While we were here, I noticed that a couple families were having parties and noticed rooms where those parties were held, which seems like a great option for people wanting to host their kids birthday party.  I won't fail to mention that there was a stationary wooden ice cream truck that was pretty large. An adult could definitely fit in there or maybe three, I saw about 56 kids there at one time, and they had kitchen and little toys to serve the "" ice cream truck parlor guests"". My daughter had an absolute blast here and I recommend this spot for any parent wanting to take their kids to an indoor play area whether it's a rainy day or a special birthday celebration.

It looks like they never update the toys, they‚Äôre all very old and so many parts are missing, therefore eliminating the amount of toys kids can play with. To top it off, they never turn on the AC or Heat. In winter it‚Äôs freezing and in summer it‚Äôs unbearably hot. They‚Äôve also shut off their water fountains because they want you to purchase water.

The birthday parties could be held for a longer time slot than 2 hours. I think a minimum of 3 hours are needed since some time is always needed to set up and breakdown the birthday party decorations.

Review: I had my daughter‚Äôs 2nd bday party here a couple of days ago and it was such a pleasure. The workers, Kianna and Leo, were so kind and helpful from the beginning to the end of our party. Since I brought my own decorations, Kianna was a big help in setting everything up. They both made our time there a pleasant time. My kids and the other kids incited had a fun time. I love how we‚Äôre able to bring in outside food. Overall, Kidtopia was professional with communication, and great at hosting us there. I‚Äôd definitely recommend throwing a party here for your little one.

Review: I‚Äôd give one star but the birthday party was actually fun. Kids had a blast but staff and service were bare bones at best. Unfortunately as our time in the rented room ended and the staff helped us load the carts to take home gifts & leftover food somebody stole my brand new iPhone charger with extended cord and hair products. I didn‚Äôt notice until I unloaded our car back at home that an entire bag of items was missing. I guess when the staff said they‚Äôd load the carts and help us out that meant help themselves to my stuff. Called the facility hoping it was a mistake and my items were in list & found but nope, they‚Äôre gone and we‚Äôre almost definitely stolen by staff as we exited.
A good time can be had here but keep close eye on your valuables and not from other people playing in building but from sticky handed (not to mention generally rude) staff.
Painful to write reviews like this. Ugh.

Review: I just had an amazing experience at Planet Bounce in Jesup, GA! This place is fantastic, with tons of fun things for kids to enjoy.

What really stood out were the two young men working there. Garrison (I hope I spelled that right!) went above and beyond to make sure my 7 yr old had the best time ever. He was incredibly kind and polite, which made our visit extra special. It‚Äôs so refreshing to see such great customer service!

If you're looking for a fun-filled day out, I highly recommend Planet Bounce. We can‚Äôt wait to come back the next time we visit Jesup! Thanks again, Garrison!

Review: Paid for a birthday party here, way overpriced. I did the ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù package nothing about it is deluxe  except maybe the party decorator she did a great job. They require a $200 deposit which is fine and then require the rest the day of the party. (Also have never paid taxes on a deposit) ‚Äútaxes‚Äù I asked if I could pay for the rest of the party as we were leaving because I wanted to go to the party room and record my daughters reaction to the decorations, I was told no I had to pay right then like I wasn‚Äôt going to pay the bill or whatever, while being told that‚Äôs what I had to do my daughter ran to the room as she saw family going in there and I didn‚Äôt get to see her reaction or record it because they wanted to be difficult, so thanks for ruining that moment for us, we were regular customers, we won‚Äôt be back.

Review: Overall, it's a very nice place for kids to spend time. The facility is clean, fun, and engaging, which makes it a great spot for children to play safely. However, one thing we didn‚Äôt appreciate was the presence of extra attractions or items that seemed designed to tempt kids but came with additional charges.

As parents, we bring our children to these centers not just for fun and safety, but also for a brief moment of peace. It would be great if the management could reconsider how these extras are presented to avoid unnecessary pressure on both kids and parents.

Otherwise, a wonderful experience overall

Review: I reviewed recently, but popped again in my feed. This place is 'ok.' At first visit, noticed facility is in need of a remodel job (floors could use refurbishing to hold heavy adult and children traffic, private party sections could use regular maintenance) and if it's possible, this location will benefit from expanded space. Overall, a bit cramped to hold all the little ones running back and forth. It helps, that the staff is personable and friendly.

Review: There's comes a point where a manager needs to understand their customers. I understand policy is policy, and I wasn't fighting it, but my situation was poorly mishandled.

My mother took my daughter here at 430 pm on 11/18 to have a good time. I work nearby and my plan was to pick her up at 530. I get here, and I mentioned I'm just here to pick up my daughter. But my daughter, and you know kids, wanted to show me what fun things she is doing. Well, I was denied entry because policy states ""1 free adult"".

I explained to the manager, I've been here before and was granted entry just for 5 minutes just so my daughter can show off what shes doing. He was still asking for $7 so I said nevermind. My mother was pretty upset because my father has entered before without penalty. Maybe we got lucky with whoever helped us before because they were lenient. Maybe the worker who helped us wasn't a manager and didn't care for the rules? Who knows.

Anyways, if policy is enforced when they feel like enforcing it, it gets confusing to the customer.

The manager who helped me didn't handle it well. He could have said, ""I understand. I'm sorry. Please go in but next time, it will be $7"". And then I would follow suit. We don't read their online website and we were unaware of the additional adult fee. Now we are. But it's too late. We're not coming back here.

To add, the manager was pretty defensive the whole time we were talking; comparing Jolly Roger to other local places and how they're more expensive and strict.

Teeny Town is around the corner and they only charge entry per kid.

Review: We come here from all the way south San Jose. My 3 years old son loves here. We have been into almost all indoor playgrounds in bay area but as of now this place is the best. We used to love going to skyzone for jumping but they messed up installing screens for watching which we are avoiding for our toddler. Jolly Roger land has everything what other playgrounds don't. They have jumping area, swing, ball play, jungle, many bikes and cars to ride, riding field, snack area. Toilets are clean. Stuff is respectful. Not so many attractive screens. (Which is plus for us)
Only thing i wish it was closer to us and i wish they had wifi for parents to do their work while kids are playing. And charging stations.

Review: I brought my almost-2 year old daughter so we stayed in the under-4 area. She had a wonderful time, but I was annoyed at the bigger kids who were clearly over 4 taking over the carousel. I asked them a few times to not spin the carousel too fast while my girl was on it. Where are their parents!? There was only 1 young person staffing the front desk busy with entrants so she could not monitor, and I feel for her. Then another big kid, a boy, was rough housing and one of the parents said he pushed a toddler. That is unacceptable. The area was a little chaotic. The accessories were scuffed, broken, worn down, dirty. But the climbing and slide unit was fantastic, and my daughter got confident with each round

I suggest owners be strict with big kids entering the toddler area!

Review: Let me tell you, this indoor play structure in the East Bay is a real rollercoaster of emotions, and by rollercoaster, I mean both the ups and downs you'll experience while visiting!

First off, let's talk about the layout. It's like a maze of fun, and my kids absolutely love it. There are more twists and turns than a telenovela, and my little ones can't get enough. They've got a ball pit that's deeper than my love for chocolate, a slide longer than my to-do list, and a small jump place that makes me reconsider my anti-jumping stance (adults should be allowed to jump too, right?).

But what really takes the cake (or should I say ice cream) is the ice cream machine. Picture this: a magical contraption that mixes ice cream on demand. It's like having a dessert genie in a corner, granting all your sugary wishes.

Now, here's where the plot thickens. The seating situation for us grown-ups is about as scarce as a unicorn sighting. Seriously, finding a place to rest your weary bones is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. And if you do manage to snag a spot, you'll quickly realize it's located next to the massage chairs. You'd think those would be a godsend, right? Wrong! They emit a never-ending chorus of loud beeping noises that will make you question the life choices that led you to this point.

So, while I'd love to give this place a solid 5-star rating, I have to dock a point for the limited seating and the ear-piercing massage chair symphony. But hey, if you can overlook those minor hiccups, you'll be in for a wild ride of indoor playtime adventure. Just be prepared to jump, slide, and dodge massage chair beeps like a ninja in a candy store.

I can definitely say this is the worst place!!!! The place is packed; The party room is loud and too tight/small for 20 kids party. There is no party host. There is discrepancies between what the owner said and their staff, which costed a lot more money for us. Apparently, the owner won't honor what the staff agreed on the phone, and insist it's mis-communication. Shady practice!!!! I would stay away from this place for birthday parties.

They don't seem to care about older kids in the toddler area or kids jumping into the ball pit with shoes on... but they made sure to put all the small toys away half an hour before closing so that they can go home faster. Parents seem to not watch their kids here or care. I only enjoy my experience here when the assumed owner is working since they are more mindful of safety and rules.

Anyway he turns it back on and then turns it off again and then throws a wet floor closed sign hoping we don't enter, and when we ask for half our money back If they are gonna shut down almost an hour early he rolls his eyes and turns the machine back on. Look I get if it was like 7:50 and ten minutes before closing but there was still an hour left and we paid for an hour. Horribly rude. Do not go here unless you wanted to be treated with disrespect.

Review: This is unacceptable, they had kids playing around with out fixing this. I let the cashier know seem not to care.  Until something bad happens then they will take the time to care. If management is reading reviews please hire better staff. And check everything everyday before opening to the public.

Review: We are recent military transfers from California to the local area and we stumbled upon this venue one afternoon driving around trying to get a lay of the land! What a hidden gem! The owner allowed my little one to come in and preview/try out the play areas to ensure she would be comfortable and safe with this being a party venue for her 5th birthday and she fell in love with the place! The venue is perfect for those parents and kiddos who are leery of the traditional amusement park, arcades, and bouncy house places where not only you, but your children are overwhelmed and overstimulated by the sounds, flashing lights, and crowds of people running around! This venue gives you an opportunity to host a party where the kids can just be kids! And, the parents can relax because the staff is watching and assisting to ensure the kids don‚Äôt get bored, hurt, or feel left out! It was nice being able to enjoy mingling with the parents of other children, family, and friends without feeling like we were being pulled in a million directions/constantly interrupted! The owner was extremely accommodating and worked with me as I fluctuated between various details regarding the party! Not to mention they coordinated so many of the details and party planning that we just showed up with the cake, party favors, and a few other items and the rest was taken care of! I highly recommend this indoor playground not just for parties, but for those parents with last minute schedule changes that need some responsible adult supervision for their kids when you are in a bind! Drop ‚ÄòN Play is the Way!

Review: Our almost 3 year old toddler enjoyed himself today at this play center. It‚Äôs safe, play set area is kid friendly and lots of activities to keep kids busy. I met the owner who was checking him in. She was very nice. The establishment is clean and tidy. We are definitely bringing our little one back when we have appointments or errands to run for few hours. It‚Äôs very convenient and the hourly fees are affordable!!

Review: I did my son 3rd birthday party here. It was a great place for a 3 year old at first I was scared he was too small for it but he did amazing and great. He has a younger sister that‚Äôs one 1/2 did amazing playing on everything as well so I recommend for age one as well and up. The private party compare to other places you couldn‚Äôt  get a better deal no where else. I was bless with the fall discount and that helped me out so much as a single mother. Even though I wasn‚Äôt able to go out more for it due to money it still was perfect. The owner was amazing and friendly. The people that help set up and helped with the kids was amazing people and friendly. Very clean environment!

This place is absolutely amazing! The play area is clean, safe, and packed with activities to keep kids entertained for hours. My child had the time of her  life exploring the slides, climbing structures, and interactive games. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure everything was running smoothly.

What really impressed me was how well-maintained the facility was‚Äîeverything looked brand new, and safety clearly takes priority here. They even have a cozy seating area for parents to relax while keeping an eye on the kids or you can drop them off and take care of a few errands.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fun and stress-free outing for your family, this is the perfect spot. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon! Highly recommended!

From the first time I reached out to get information about booking a party to the morning of communication was amazing! They always made sure I was up to date with what was going on and what I needed to know prior to party day!

The day of the party they were beyond helpful making sure we had everything we needed and they even offered to help unload my car! They helped keep the pace of the party so everything was timed out perfectly!

My daughter and her friends had the absolute best time and she has asked me every day since when we can go back there to play!!

Also some of the electronic games were not working and some claw machines were missing jobs and buttons.  There is a corner with play pots and pans and kitchens that my child enjoyed playing in... but many of the food items were missing their other halves and some of the oven doors were broken. Love that you pay for the day and there's unlimited in and out!

Review: I should have known from the first call that I should not have booked my daughter‚Äôs birthday party here. I have never done a party at a jump n play kind of place before and needless to say this entire experience has left such a bad impression that I never want to do one again. There was never a manager available for us to speak to. No one communicated properly. The lack of communication is like nothing I have ever seen before. I‚Äôve been in the customer service industry for my entire life and have never seen a business that was ran so poorly.  I have never felt inclined to write a bad review but this place really ruined everything for me. When I first called to book my daughter‚Äôs birthday the phone rang and went to voicemail like it was a personal cell phone. If you are going to run a legitimate business then I would suggest having a real business line with a real voicemail box set up. I left one message, no call back, two messages, no call back. I left an email in the inquiry box on their website, no response. Finally on my third voicemail they called me back. I asked to book the date that I wanted to they said ‚Äúsure but let me call you back‚Äù. Whoever I was speaking with didn‚Äôt know how to reserve the room and date. They called me back and told me I needed to put down my credit card information for the 50% deposit but, they said they would call me back because they didn‚Äôt know how to take my card info. Then they called me back and sent me a link. I went through the steps with them on the phone. It took 20 minutes to do this. It was such a waste of time. As a business owner you need to figure out a better solution to taking payment over the phone. Come week of the party I get a call wanting to confirm my party. I confirm it. They call me back a couple days later and asked to confirm again. I confirmed it. Then they called me yet AGAIN on the actual day of the party to yet again confirm my reservation. The lack of communication was clear. As a business owner you should really work on communication with your staff.  We get to the jump n play the day of our reservation and they told me they needed the same card I booked the reservation with to finish charging us for the other 50% of the party. They also told me that there was an email sent to me that said I would need that card. No email like that was ever sent to me. They lied to me to make it look like it was my fault. To have your employees lie to the customer is pathetic. That card unfortunately was closed because we had fraud on the card so there was no way to present the card. The staff made my husband leave his own daughters birthday party to go get cash. There are so many ways in this day and age to be able to accept multiple credit cards. As a business owner you need talk to the bank about a solution.  Their business specialist will be happy to help you out with that. While my husband drove around in the pouring rain missing his daughters birthday party the staff continued to harass me for the money. They threatened to not allow any of my guests in until they had their money. Like they were pimps bullying their employees. They came in to ask me for the money three separate times within 30 minutes. Finally my husband came back after missing half his daughters birthday and gave the staff the FULL AMOUNT for the party. Not just the 50% that was needed. They said they would refund the 50% deposit which ultimately did end up coming back to us after almost a week. All in all I will never be giving another dime to this place. It‚Äôs sad because my daughter enjoyed going there but after this experience of unprofessionalism I never want to step foot there again. I hope the owner reads this review and figures our  how to make the proper adjustments. I never want to see a business fail but if this is how they run their business then I don‚Äôt see how it could last.

I visit this place frequently since my daughter is very happy. This place has many fun things for them and it stays less busy during the week during the day.
There is access to having birthday parties in that place.
It is a charge of $17 dollars per child and one adult with unlimited time

Review: I'm a bit disappointed when it comes to indoor playgrounds for kids. You have to buy their socks only ""store policy"". The arcade games are a bit expensive for their value. If it's not too crowded your kids can have fun. There's no limit on maximum occupancy so it will get full

Review: This is a cool spot for fun and entertainment for kids of all ages! The variety of indoor attractions is impressive - from bounce houses and obstacle courses to arcade games and toddler-friendly play areas, there's something for everyone. The layout is well thought out, making it easy to navigate even when it gets busy. The staff is friendly and attentive, always ready to help with a smile. While everything is clean and organized, I'd love to see a bit more seating for parents on the entrance. Overall, it's a great place for a family outing, birthday party, or just letting the kids burn off energy!

Review: DONT BOOK HERE!

Our experience with booking a party room was less than good. Nothing was set up in the room. We had to set up the tables and chairs. There were not enough plates nor cups given to us (which we paid for) there weren‚Äôt any utensils nor any napkins for my guests. We had to go back and forth several times asking for more party materials. We had to continuously ask for them to make an announcement for the kids to join for food. We paid over $400 for this experience. Why did we pay so much is we had to set everything up? I texted in advance to come in 30 minutes prior to ensure everything was set up and again, it was not.

Upon reaching out to management they said that it was a misunderstanding on my end and that I was at fault. I asked for some kind of discount and or compensation but they refused and left me on read.

Review: Very unpleasant experience at the indoor playground in Hayward ""Jump N Play""

Today I took my children to the Jump N Play playground expecting to have a fun and safe day. However, our experience was the complete opposite. I drove over 60 miles to get to the park hoping it would be worth it.

At first, everything seemed normal and the children were having fun on the rides. However, as we were playing, after a while, I noticed a group of people entering who clearly smelled like marijuana. The smell was very strong and obvious, and I found it unacceptable that the park staff allowed them to enter knowing that it is a place designed for small children.

I felt very uncomfortable and worried about the health of my children, as the smell was extremely strong and I did not want them to inhale those fumes.  I found it irresponsible and negligent of the park not to take measures to prevent the presence of illegal substances in a place where children should feel safe and protected.

Also, the games and equipment seemed old and in poor condition.

I do not recommend this park to any family looking for a safe and enjoyable place for their children. I hope the park takes steps to improve the safety and maintenance of the place.

Review: Here comes a heartfelt review from a truly grateful customer!

We hosted our daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday party here and this place was exceptional. Many guests gave us compliments saying that this was one of the best birthday events they had ever attended and that their kids had lot of fun. You know you have booked the right place when your guests say they will also plan their kid‚Äôs birthday here.

There are many things that that are unique about this place:
1. This place is truly a fun place for kids of all ages. Their games and rides are innovative, much better than competitors like Kidtopia. We had kids of age 3-4 and older kids of age 6-9, and all enjoyed a lot.
2. The staff is exceptionally helpful, caring and professional. Pearl and her team assisted us throughout the event. The entire team was involved in helping setup the decoration, serving pizza, cake cutting, cleanup etc. They ensured the place was clean, and were always very cheerful. They took photos of the event for us and were always willing to help. This truly exceeded my expectations.
3. We were offered a photographer as a part of the party package we had booked (a private event)- who did an incredible job. He not only captured all the key moments perfectly but also voluntarily setup a photo booth where all the guests could take photos. The photographer entertained all requests patiently, until the last guest, all this while with a smile on his face and suggesting some great poses. The guests loved this! While our guests got some amazing pictures with their families, we enjoyed seeing our daughter‚Äôs pictures with her daycare friends - all beautifully captured.
4. This place offers the option to book the entire hall and also allows outside food - which enhanced the experience. Our guests were pleasantly surprised. Very few places give such options. Many of the guests plan to celebrate their birthday events here as well.

If you are looking to book this place, you won‚Äôt regret it and if you‚Äôve booked it, you‚Äôre in for a pleasant ride.

Great for rainy days or something to get out of the house. *Just a side note for those with chemical sensitivity, it has a very strong smell from febreeze which if you've done your research can be an endocrine disruptor and mess with hormones* My 3 year old had fun though!

Pictures are deceiving. Also, I paid for the hour and socks, just to be told 30 minutes in that I had to leave because of a private party and was not refunded any amount of money. Why wasn‚Äôt I told that before paying ? Or price cut in half? The young girl that worked there seemed very out of place and had no motivation to her whatsoever.

Review: The fun we had!  I booked a party for my son's 5th birthday party and booked for the whole facility.  My sister lives near here and told me about the place but we didn't know what to expect.  I visited it about 2 weeks before the party to check it out.  One thing my son wanted was a huge bouncy house for him and his friends to bounce on.  Well, they had a obstacle course one which was great.  They also had a toddler area which was perfect for me because it was a place my 1 year old could go play while the kids were on the bigger bouncy area.   When the birthday party came, I was a wreck but the staff was so helpful.  They helped me setup, made sure my food was stored in a great place and just helped the party.  The kids apparently loved the toddler zone.  They stayed there the most!  It was a blast and I have to thank the staff for making my son's birthday great.

Oh and we added the face painter and she was awesome as well.  So sweet and patient with the kids.

Women bring their kids like it‚Äôs a daycare a chill out on the bench a let them just run wild in what I considered less age appropriate for them. The young man that was there could give two diapers less about anything going on. I love that it looks black owned but other than that it was a disappointment.

Review: I think the concept of this place is very cool and offers parents an outlet and place for their kids to release energy in a climate controlled environment.

The issues that I have with this place are; they have a toddler time for under 3 year olds, but it‚Äôs not in an enclosed area where parents can kind of relax and monitor their children.
They have an entrance area that should be gated,  so that kids are enclosed so and can safely play while being monitored by a seated parent, and that doesn‚Äôt require you to constantly chase them. I really dislike this lack of a feature at this establishment and it truly has a negative effect on the experience when going.

this is a place for children to play and I feel like it‚Äôs also a place where parents can go and possibly get some work done or socialise with other parents while safely monitoring their children play with other kids.

The lack of having a gated area does not allow this at all. It‚Äôs also quite dangerous to have an open area that a young child under the age of three could simply walk out and open the door and go outside and get hit by a car.

Next, There are not bicycles in the area.  with children that are under three years old , it‚Äôs kind of overkill asking them to constantly come off of the mat area. A heavier woman kept redirecting my child off of the mat. Why have bikes in the same area? People do different things. No one has ever mentioned this before or had a problem.

Then, they have an upselling scheme of charging you $4 if you forget your socks. I have about five pairs of socks at this point because I do end up forgetting the socks whenever I spontaneously decide to come by this place.
you would think they had some type of system.
It‚Äôs literally just a tactic to make more money.
Toddler Socks don‚Äôt cost $4 for 1 pair.
If a child is wearing socks, it‚Äôs ridiculous to even charge to buy theirs.

I feel the quality of children and parents is low class and I had an experience where a child put my child in a headlock and left a scratch of my child‚Äôs neck.
The child was a bit older and clearly had some behavioural issues as the parent was not able to communicate effectively for the child to acknowledge they had done something wrong.
For this reason in addition to the other concern stated, I decided that I won‚Äôt be coming to this place anymore.

It‚Äôs truly a shame because there isn‚Äôt anything else that‚Äôs in this area, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable paying $17 for one hour of letting my kid play and also subjecting my child to certain dangers. It‚Äôs not worth it.

Review: Initially, I didn't like it. It's a small place. I don't think the little rolling things should be so close to the play area especially when there are large party groups right next to the play area. I'm a first-time father so I'm very protective of my baby boy. We were celebrating his first birthday and I understand that the world doesn't revolve around but the other little kids are still little kids but NOT my kid so their being so careless around him didn't sit right with me even considering their young states. One kid was reckless on the rolling thing and ran into my new Jordans while his mom sat stuffing her face. That irritated me a bit but once I focused on my little guy and how much fun he was having it was all worth it.  But I will say that it was neat and clean and kids can have fun there and maybe when he's older we may give it another shot. They did inspire me to get my little guy a bounce house and trampoline although they don't have one. I would post pictures but I've got a thing about posting permanent pictures of my kid on the net. I would recommend it for maybe 2 and older. And if you're a decent parent who watches their kids and teaches them things.

The daycare is like the perfect size in numbers to where your child will get enough positive interactions from their peers and the staff. Please check them out! I highly recommend them.

Review: We had an awesome experience at The Playpad. I‚Äôd taken the day off work and was looking for somewhere to take my 3-year old to kill some time in the afternoon. I found The Playpad on the map and decided to head over. I pre-purchased my ticket through my mobile device (the page was cut off so I couldn‚Äôt see some of the text but that was a minor inconvenience). They had several ride on toys and 2 bouncy areas that my son enjoyed. There were not many people so that was nice. They also have a soft play area that‚Äôs nice from smaller kids. We also enjoyed the large connect four and the virtual reality game. There was also a camp going on while we were there and the kids were enjoying crafts. They have chips Sam‚Äôs juice for sale and there‚Äôs a dominoes next door. Parking was also a breeze. Overall, it was a great experience! The customer service was exceptional, I felt like my kid was safe and having fun, and it was a good value for the price. It‚Äôs small but it doesn‚Äôt take much to entertain a 3 year old and he had a ball!!

Review: I had my baby‚Äôs first birthday here, I would not advise anyone to party here at all. I rented the entire place for a private party . She only allowed 10 kids which is ridiculous. We paid for the extra kids which made no sense if I have the building for the party. The treatment she gave us was rude and uncalled for.  She aggressively threw us out of her establishment. Turning over tables so we wouldn‚Äôt sit. She threw away decorations and took pictures of my party as though she had a hand in it besides providing the building . I asked for the pictures taken throughout the entire celebration by her staff she refused to send them. First of all she didn‚Äôt get any consent from everyone. Comparing my experience to someone else 3 years ago she has definitely forgotten the importance of customer service . There was no reason to be intentionally impolite. I wouldn‚Äôt dare trust my child with her for a camp. I hope this helps someone make a decision.

We did my daughter's 4th birthday there this past weekend and everything was perfect. Jen (the owner) is awesome. So sweet, reliable and responsive. She wants everything to be easy and perfect for you as the busy parent. The rest of her staff is also so beyond sweet. Everyone had a BLAST! Also, the pizza they get from next store is really yummy (antico style) not just ""regular pizza."" The type of play stuff they have is really good for ranges of ages so my daughter and most of her friends are 4 but there were siblings there older and younger that all had things to be occupied with. We did the 3 hour galaxy package to have the place to ourselves, so worth it. 3 hours of play time is VERY generous!! Overall 10/10 experience. Wouldn't change a thing!!<3<3<3<3

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs fourth birthday at Funville Factory and it could not have been more perfect. From the moment we arrived, the owners were right there welcoming us and helping set everything up, making sure we had everything we needed. They even accommodated us with juice boxes, the cutest Super Kitties themed plates, and a pile of stickers that the kids went crazy over.

The place itself is a little smaller than some of the bigger indoor playgrounds, but honestly that was a huge plus. There was so much variety packed into the space with swings, slides, pretend houses, and climbing areas, and because it was cozy, it was easy to keep an eye on all the kids without feeling overwhelmed. The owners were constantly walking around, making sure everyone was happy and calmly stepping in if two kids looked like they might get into a squabble. It felt so safe and thoughtfully run.

The party room looked amazing when we walked in, like a mini Super Kitties world made just for our daughter. They paid attention to every little detail, making sure every child had a seat, plenty of juice, and a stack of stickers to take home. It made the whole party feel really special and personal.

Funville Factory is perfect for younger kids, especially around two to six years old. It seems like they do not really accept kids older than six, which honestly makes sense because the space is so perfectly tailored for the little ones. If you have a four-year-old like we do, this place feels like a dream.

What really stood out the most was how personally involved the owners were the entire time. They were not just running the place, they were making sure our daughter and all her friends were having the best time. We could not have asked for a better experience and we will definitely be back.

Review: I‚Äôm a nanny for two sweet little girls ages 1 and 2 . I originally was going to have a friend with me to help take the girls to a park or something because it‚Äôs hard to take them places by myself. Our plans fell through but I really wanted the girls to have an adventure. So I searched indoor places and stumbled upon this place! So We went Last Friday in the evening and at first I was hesitant with the prices but I decided to give them a shot! And I‚Äôm sooo glad I did!! The pricing makes so much sense once you are in there! They have lots of toys and jungle gym type things for toddlers to play on! It‚Äôs super clean in there, even with it being a place for toddlers the germs are always everywhere. But the staff was frequently cleaning and watching over the kids so the parents or nanny ,like my self , can feel at ease and not have to be a Helicopter. MAJOR PLUS! They also have these cute slippers that you wear to go to the restrooms so your feet aren‚Äôt touching the bathroom floor! Lastly in the front they have snacks, more toys and gagets for the kids either free or a low price! Overall, me and the girls will Definitely be back! And thank you Funville for making our experience peaceful and fun!

This is a small business and the owner is super kind and personable. She really does enjoy children. The place is very clean. They sanitize constantly. My daughter never gets sick from here like other indoor play areas. It‚Äôs a great place to come anytime but it has been a life saver during cold rainy weather as well. They do parents night out which has been amazing. My daughter will not go to anyone but she will go to the owner at Funville. They also have lots of special events such as reading or arts and crafts. I highly recommend this place for just playing and for birthday parties. It was one of the best parties we held.

Review: We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday here and it was amazing !! We took the decor package as well which was great option , all I needed to do is bring the cake and it‚Äôs all ready! I loved how the decorated  the party room with the theme I‚Äôve picked , everyone who walked in the room was amazed on how great the room looks ! The owner Jenn and the team made sure we‚Äôre good through out the time we were there and our baby even got a present from them. In general we love this place but I highly recommend this place for parties and play time !

Review: I‚Äôve been going to Funville for a while now and I have to say this is the best place in town for young kids. I had a really hard time finding an age appropriate playspace that catered to toddlers.

Not only is this place suited for kids under 6, the staff does an incredible job of keeping the place clean and organized. An impressive feat with a bunch of 1&2 year olds running around.

I also had the chance to speak with the owner, and she takes cleanliness, safety, and overall experience very seriously while being incredibly personable.

I highly recommend Funville for any parents wanting a safe, fun place for their little!

The staff members are really nice and the environment is SUPER clean. I love that they make you remove your shoes and have a designated bathroom area with provided slippers to go to the bathroom. It‚Äôs such a cute little area and they even do birth celebrations. Definitely recommend parents taking their kids if you‚Äôre looking.

Review: This place seems like a lot of fun for kids, has lots to play with, is clean and well-maintained, and has reasonable prices.

However, the two times I‚Äôve been there‚Äìweekday afternoons‚Äìit‚Äôs been uncomfortably crowded. They also have a fair bit of clutter from the toy kitchen, puzzles, train station, etc. that ends up littering the whole area.

Between the overcrowding and the clutter, my one-year-old was terribly overstimulated after an hour and a half each time we visited. He had trouble falling asleep‚Äìwent to bed well over an hour late‚Äìafter both of our visits. We get out and about doing toddler things most days and that‚Äôs never happened anywhere else, so for me that really highlights how overstimulating it is here.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fun place for lots of kids, but unfortunately it‚Äôs not a great environment for mine.

Review: This is the nicest indoor playground we found in the Atlanta area. I frequent quite a few of these with my 2 yo on rainy days and birth parties. I couldn't even have imagined one could be so nice until a friend brought me here. The colors are pastel and soothing, they play classical music, and the staff wipes down and tidies constantly throughout all the stations. They have stations for fine motor and gross motor skills. You just don't see overstimulated children, like the other ones. I love this place and will continue driving here from Brookhaven. The owner is really awesome too! My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves

Review: We stumbled across Funville earlier this summer (thank you OTP Mama for the tip!) It quickly became a favorite play spot for our toddler and was a life savor for us on those grueling hot summer days.

The place is AMAZING - with all sorts of toys/sensory exploration/playground fun you need to keep a toddler (or crew of toddlers!) entertained for hours on end. They also offer various packages - that you can take advantage of through their membership OR NOT. (I personally appreciate that flexibility in a membership/subscription dominant world) Of course they have birthday party packages, and we just hosted our son‚Äôs 2nd birthday party there.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what to expect - but it was an amazing day that went off without a hitch. The owner, Jen, went above and beyond with the decorations. All I had to do was share the number of attendees and theme, and she took care of the rest (‚Ä¶and had it decorated better than I ever could have!!) Jen‚Äôs professionalism - which permeates through her entire staff - is top notch and the Funville team‚Äôs customer service makes party day enjoyable for everyone (parents too!). The pizza that‚Äôs included as part of the birthday package is delicious - and also happens to be right next store, in case you need to add on any last minute additions. (Have I mentioned the convenience of this experience??) My husband and I were carefree from start to finish and it really changed the entire day for us - it was totally worth it. They also took care of the gift bags AND had a special gift for the birthday boy.

THANK YOU Jen and the Funville Factory team for making this such a wonderful day - and planning experience - for my family! I absolutely recommend this place for anyone with kiddos (toddlers are the sweet spot, but I feel like kids up to 7 or 8 would also have a ball). And if you‚Äôre looking for a fun space for your next event, and a professional/customer-focused staff to help you execute, you‚Äôve found your spot!

Review: Funville was the perfect place to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 3rd birthday. I purchased the private event package, and the place was closed to the public for a couple of hours. My daughter could enjoy the place comfortably with her friends, and I could relax and enjoy talking to my family and friends without worrying about cleaning, serving food, or setting up the decorations. The staff did a wonderful job with the decorations and setting up the tables. My daughter wanted a Minnie Mouse-themed birthday, so the staff decorated the party room according to that theme and even had Minnie Mouse plates and utensils for the cake. They also provided goodie bags for all my daughter‚Äôs friends. My friend told me how much her two kids loved what was in the good bags. My daughter also received a Funville T-shirt, a Mickey Mouse puzzle, and a lollipop.

Also, the package includes Napoli pizzas (the pizza place is next to Funville) for your guests. This was the first time I had Napoli pizza, and I fell in love with its fresh ingredients and overall flavor! Most of my guests had their pizza for the first time and are planning a separate trip to Funville and Napoli Pizza.

Another reason to have your toddler celebrate their birthday at Funville is that parents do not have to chase after their toddler. This is because Funville is a small space, but it is packed with interactive and fun activities that will keep them occupied. It is also clean and well-maintained thanks to the staff who ensure everything is in order. I could catch up on conversations with parents and enjoy myself while knowing my daughter is playing safely with other kids.

I highly recommend this event space! Thanks, Funville!

Review: Hi Valerie,

Thank you for your feedback. We apologize if our pricing felt too high for you.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of our pricing:

	‚Ä¢	$1 for adults: We strive to keep our prices affordable. Many indoor playgrounds charge around $4.99 for adults, or even the same amount as for children. For comparison, our family recently visited the Peppa Pig Theme Park, which charged $70 for adults despite there being no rides for adults. (It was super fun to watch our kids having a BLAST!)
	‚Ä¢	$4 for children 8 months and younger: But they play for FREE WITH A PAYING SIBLING!
	‚Ä¢	$10 for children aged 9 to 21 months: Our playground is specially designed for this age group, with plenty of toys and activities tailored to their needs.
	‚Ä¢	$16 for children aged 22 months and up: We carefully researched our pricing and can assure you that our prices are among the most competitive in Georgia.

Regarding cleanliness, I can assure you that we take this very seriously. We clean and disinfect regularly throughout the day, even if it may not always be visible. We understand that while you‚Äôre focused on watching your child, it might be easy to miss our team in action. Additionally, we don‚Äôt mop the floors during business hours to avoid soaking your socks or causing slips and falls, which is why we require socks to be worn. We are also moving our shoe rack outside the entrance to help keep socks clean and ensure a better experience for everyone.

We appreciate your input and hope to welcome you back soon.

Review: Dear Eve's Garden Team,

I wanted to share how much we enjoyed our first visit today. I was immediately impressed by how clean and welcoming your facility is. The staff members we encountered were also incredibly friendly and made us feel right at home.

As a work-from-home mom, I particularly appreciated the opportunity to get some work done while my children could play in such a comfortable and safe environment. Additionally, the sensory-friendly activities were absolutely perfect for my son who has autism.

Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful experience for my family. We are already looking forward to our next visit!

Best regards,

Tamecia

Review: Eve‚Äôs Garden was such an amazing experience for both me and my son. There are lots of entertainment activities to occupy 1 year olds while parents overlook their children. I viewed items and areas being cleaned throughout our time there and I love that there are 3-4 bathrooms (that I‚Äôve counted) on sight. Although the virtual experience with the sandbox was not available, my son still enjoyed himself playing in the sand. There was even a painting opportunity for the kids. Overall this is the place to go for a quality experience for your kids.

Review: In response to Curt Digla & Nordrissa Lewis:
I completely disagree with this review, as my experiences at this venue have always and consistently been the complete opposite. It‚Äôs clear that the reviewer had a frustrating visit, but many of their complaints seem exaggerated or based on misunderstandings.
First, calling this place a ""glorified daycare"" is unfair. It‚Äôs an indoor entertainment space designed for kids to have fun in a safe and engaging environment. The bounce houses, attractions, and activities are exactly what one would expect from a family-friendly venue.
It makes perfect business sense for certain attractions to be available only on specific days to encourage visits during slower periods (i.e. Wednesday)‚Äîthis is a common business strategy, not an attempt to deceive customers.
Regarding pricing, hosting a party at any entertainment venue comes with costs, and $416 for a birthday party that includes a dedicated space, play areas, and food is actually quite reasonable compared to similar venues. Pizza and Capri Suns are standard party offerings, and expecting gourmet options at this price point is unrealistic.
As for the cake, I don‚Äôt know of a single venue that includes cakes as part of the package‚Äîoutside cakes are clearly allowed, so all it takes is asking. However, last-minute issues can happen anywhere, and instead of escalating frustration, a simple check with staff could have clarified the situation.
The owners and their family members are PHENOMENAL, and their staff is professional. If a child was asked to remove a wristband, I have no doubt it was handled appropriately. The accusation of racial favoritism is not only unfair but also unfounded‚ÄîTHIS BUSINESS DOES NOT OPERATE ON RACIAL BIAS.
Additionally, the claim that the venue fabricates positive reviews is simply false.
Comparing this experience to renting a bounce house at home completely ignores the fact that not everyone has the space, time, or desire to host a party themselves. Many parents appreciate the convenience of an all-in-one venue where they don‚Äôt have to worry about setup, cleanup, or keeping kids entertained.
This review is overly negative and fails to recognize the value this venue provides. My personal experience, as well as that of many others, has been overwhelmingly positive.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VENUE TO PARENTS‚ÄîIT IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST, FRIENDLIEST INDOOR PLAY AREAS WE HAVE EVER TAKEN OUR LITTLE ONE TO. WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN!

On Wednesdays we come for toddler time and since my toddler isn‚Äôt in daycare, it‚Äôs nice to have a social setting where he can meet other kids.

If you're looking for a safe, family-friendly, Christian-based environment that uplifts children and offers engaging, kid-friendly programs, this is the place to be!

Every time we visit, I can sit back and relax, knowing my son is safe and well cared for. The staff is attentive, engaging, and truly makes the experience enjoyable for both kids and parents. They also offer a variety of fun and educational programs each month, which I absolutely love! Highly

Review: I was here yesterday at my cousins 2nd birthday party and I had a bad experience I completely agree with Niva and Curt, when having a child micromanaging other kids and snatching their wristband off is very unprofessional not only that the male owner comes to a party to try and check someone about a bad review is unprofessional and unreal. The prices are too high for it to be a daycare center with 2 bouncy houses. 30$ to do nothing is insane. Then for you to use the same paint brushes for each child face like Covid and other things not going around is crazy. I rate this place a 0/10 I will never send my worst enemy there.

The building accommodates the amount of bounce houses that it can according to its size, no false advertising at all. If someone is looking for more they could have simply driven an hour away to find one. No need to tear down an awesome business. It‚Äôs clean on the inside and many staff around to keep it that way and to offer any help. I personally will come back to this business with awesome owners and I‚Äôm glad that they have brought an indoor playground here to Conyers as it was greatly needed and appreciated.

Review: We came here as part of a birthday party and had a nice time! We were greeted warmly, and the facility was immaculately clean which started things off perfectly. They have a couple different bounce houses, an infant/small toddler area, an obstacle course, and two different sensory rooms. This would be an excellent rainy day spot to take a family, especially if you have infants and school-aged kiddos.

The only reason this isn‚Äôt a five star review is because the venue itself isn‚Äôt great at noise dampening and with the motors from the inflatables, it‚Äôs very loud even before there are kids running and playing. Overall, if we lived closer we‚Äôd absolutely be frequenting here!

Review: I can‚Äôt rave about Eve‚Äôs Garden enough!!! I took my daughter to this establishment for the very first time, and she had an absolute blast!!! I was extremely impressed and pleased when I called in and spoke with the owner. Her name is Scherika (I‚Äôll come back and confirm if I spelled her name correctly). She was so nice, pleasant, down to earth and professional all at once. When we arrived, my child was the only guest there, but the owner assured me that she would have someone to play with in no time, as her children were just finishing their studies. We received a first visit discount, but even without the discount, it‚Äôs still very reasonably priced. She and her children were so sweet and attentive to my daughter. She also has massage chairs for the parents (better than the nail salon pedicure chairs). She noticed that my daughter was tugging on my hand, but I had just sat down and began the massage, so she came and got my baby, took her by the hand, and led her to yet another one of the many activities that they have to offer, so that I could finish my massage‚Ä¶ THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for that!!! I‚Äôm also happy that no shoes are allowed, so that keeps dirty shoes germs at bay. All in all, a wonderful experience!!! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back in a couple of days!!!

Review: I was searching for an indoor playroom in my area to take my nearly 20-month-old granddaughter and found Eve's Garden at the last minute when I had almost given up. I wasn't in the mood for the chaos of a trampoline park, but with the extreme heat, I knew we wanted to be indoors. From the moment we walked in, I was impressed by the safe, clean and fun environment. My granddaughter had an absolute blast, and to my surprise, my 11-year-old son enjoyed himself as well. They had air hockey, basketball, jumbo connect 4, an inflatable obstacle course, an interactive sand room and an interactive ball game room with a projector for him.

The variety of activities available kept both children entertained and busy. It took my granddaughter a little while to acclimate, but in no time, she was running around, laughing and playing! For this outing, I was specifically looking for a toddler-friendly space, ensuring she could have fun without the risk of being trampled by bigger kids. Eve's Garden perfectly fit the bill, and it was an added bonus that my son also had a great time. The music was amazing, and although we didn't partake because we had just eaten, I saw that they had a variety of snacks and drinks for purchase.

I've already recommended Eve's Garden to a dozen friends and family and can't wait to visit again when my granddaughter is back in town. The experience, staff, cleanliness and overall atmosphere were all top-notch. 10 out of 10!

She assisted with the setup and clean up, kept everyone on schedule with the itinerary, provided everything we needed, and was just a joy to work with. Thank you guys for your hard work and making my daughter's birthday such a memorable experience.

Review: Wow! This was great for my 2 year old! Here are some note worthy things

1. It smelled and looked super clean!
2. It was organized which promoted safe play which naturally encouraged the little ones to put things back where they found them . Yall!!! My kid won‚Äôt even do this at home haha!
3. Staff and the owner were very friendly and made sure to interact with the kids.
4. The girls that work there actively encouraged play and explained how to use the interactive games.

Go! Great for a day when the kids have the zoomies and need to get their energy out !

Review: I have 4 small kids and I take them to indoor playgrounds often. Coming here was the BEST experience I‚Äôve had. I hardly have bad experiences at indoor playgrounds, but the customer service was unmatched. My kids had a great time and I had a great time too. The staff was extremely helpful in the whole process- from helping my kids put their non-slip socks on, to actually playing with my kids. They enjoyed the bouncy houses, the air hockey, the game room, basketball , the play area, and the sand. There are so many activities to choose from. We will definitely be going back.

Review: My children LOVED Eve's Garden!!!! They played the entire time! My younger one doesn't care much for inflatables, but she loved the younger kid interactive area and REALLY LOVED the interactive sand table. She actually tried an inflatable before we left and liked it.  My son loved EVERYTHING, from the inflatables to the ball wall, to the sand table, to the air hockey to basketball...like I said EVERYTHING!

My six year old had a meltdown, unlike one I had ever seen when it was time to leave. The owner helped me, made me not feel judged, and even whispered a quick prayer for my patience. I don't think she really understands how much I needed and value that! This place is really a gem!!!!

Review: Excellent play place. I'd recommend for kids under 10, plus or minus a few. Designated toddler-friendly area, bounce houses of various sizes, an obstacle course, and two computer interactive rooms. Basketball and air hockey. And I LOVE how sanitary and well maintained the facilities are. The staff members were super friendly and helpful. We'll be back!

Review: Brought my 1.5 year old here for the first time. There is a great area set up for babies/young toddlers. He also really enjoyed the sensory sand box. The owner and her daughter were so nice. My lil man is very shy and timid but the owners daughter was so sweet with him and took time to interact and play with him while he warmed up. He enjoyed himself here. I appreciate that it wasn‚Äôt super loud and chaotic like other indoor play grounds. We‚Äôll be coming back especially during the too-hot to play outside summer days.

Review: Came to visit the area from Maine & were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this business. We brought our 3 & 1 year old there today. Had a lovely time. Staff was so kind & patient with the kids. If you want a place to let the kids get out some energy in a controlled & safe environment, this is the place! My kids had a blast & didn't want to leave. Give them a try :)

Review: We had our daughter‚Äôs second birthday party here the other weekend and it went so amazing. Everyone was so helpful, kind and eager to assist or make things easier for us. I really couldn‚Äôt say enough great things about the establishment and the family who runs it.
The thing that drew me in to this facility is how it is someplace safer and more aimed to the younger kids. Taking my toddler to a big name jump place is absolutely out of the question. They‚Äôd get trampled before getting completely through the door. At Eve‚Äôs garden, I know she‚Äôs able to run and jump and play- just living her best life and I don‚Äôt have to be in constant fear she‚Äôs going to get ran over by a big kid.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they have things aimed for the older kids, it‚Äôs not just for toddlers. My 8 year old daughter and 9 year old niece had a blast there as well! There‚Äôs a really cool obstacle course kinda thing that they had a great time with. There‚Äôs an interactive sand table that‚Äôs one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen for kids in a long time. Ok maybe not just for kids cause I did play with it too lol and there‚Äôs an air hockey table that took me back to my childhood daycare days.
Overall, this place is great. The staff is great. The environment is great. We will definitely be back to Eve‚Äôs garden indoor playground!!!
Thank you all again so much for helping us with our party. Top tier. 10/10 very much recommend!!!

Review: This fun place just opened a few weeks ago and my kids had a great time! For ages 13 and under, they have inflatables, a basketball arcade game, ball wall room with projector, a standing sand box with projector, air hockey, large connect four, and a designated place for really little ones. They even have a spacious party room for you to have your birthday parties! The whole place, including the bathrooms, are clean and the owners and staff are super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend Eve's Garden Indoor Play for a fun time!

Review: Eves Garden is a fun place for kids. My daughters had a blast playing on the inflatables, air hockey and the interactive ball wall. It is the perfect size for my youngest daughter who is 3 years old to stay entertain without being overwhelmed with too many people or kids running around. My oldest, 6 years old, could have played on the ball wall all night. They really enjoyed themselves and the owners were really friendly in making sure the girls were safe and having fun.
