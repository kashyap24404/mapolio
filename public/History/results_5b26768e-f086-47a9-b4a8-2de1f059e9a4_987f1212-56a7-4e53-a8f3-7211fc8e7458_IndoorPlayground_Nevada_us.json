From beginning to end it was such a smooth process and really made my job a lot easier as far as prep work went. Miss Michelle and the rest of the staff were amazing! The package I purchased included a theme of my choice, them setting everything up for the party all decorations, paper plates, etc. included! Afterwards, they cleaned everything up for me which gave me a lot more time to be able to just enjoy the party and my baby. I am so grateful for this place and the wonderful people who own it, and I hope that they stay in business forever! I would also like to add that it was very clean. It smelt clean upon entrance, which also made me feel a whole lot better for my baby and the other kiddos that were playing truly a great place to have a party. If you have a toddler, they will be extremely entertained, and the parents can even take a seat on the sofa and relax as they watch the kids play!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erienne Elliott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My daughter had the greatest time for her birthday.

It was time to leave and one of my kids doesn’t want to leave, and I was alone with 3 kids (one is infant), so I was trying to carry the two, but the kid of mine who’s is crying were able to go back inside the play area, I told the lady that I’ll be back to get him because I had to drop my other children’s off in our car. So when I got back, an old lady grabbed my child to the exit door (like the play area door) I said I got it. I just don’t like how she grabbed my son like that and literally to kick him out just because there’s a party coming by the time they close. Idk who she is. But I don’t like what she did. I said I’ll be back and I did. Good thing my other kids are left in the car for a minute or else I’m gonna be there to confront her why she grabbed my son literally to the door SMH lady let me do it, don’t touch my child. Besides, I already noticed that most of the educational music toys doesn’t work, it doesn’t have even batteries. What’s up with that SMH. Toys are old it’s not that it’s dirty because it’s already end of the day, it’ doesn’t work\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julien\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Briella Lee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth Erickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The owners are so friendly and always welcoming. The play area is great for kids up to about 5/6 years old. My kids are 1 and 3 and there are plenty of activities for both of them, they also have a baby play area. We just started to visit with our playgroup, Tiny Hikes and Adventures. It's great here because there are always friends to play with, but our Tiny Hikes Friends are everything!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bryant Chesser\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Astrid magnolia Jimenez valenzuela\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I looked for it by blippi\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kevin Ersoy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for young kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lililuv85\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Attended a Birthday party, place was ,amazing, secure, facilities were clean, all the kids enjoyed playing there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Duong\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fidgets is a small playground that my daughter and I have been frequenting for the past two years. Whenever I need a moment of relaxation and she needs some playtime, we know exactly where to go!\n\nOne of the things that I truly appreciate about Fidgets is the sense of safety it provides for my daughter. The playground is just the right size - not too big - allowing me to always have a clear view and hear her voice from across the room. It brings me peace of mind.\n\nMoreover, Fidgets is equipped with a variety of toys suitable for kids of all ages, ranging from 1 to 6 or 7 years old. It ensures that every child's play needs are met. Additionally, I find the place to be consistently clean, which is a huge plus for me as a parent. The staff members are always friendly and welcoming, making our visits even more enjoyable.\n\nI wanted to reach out and share my positive experience with you. If you're ever in need of a safe and fun environment for your child, I highly recommend checking out  Fidgets. I'm confident you'll have a similar experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: CW L\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Staudinger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Fantastic place for the little ones up to age 6.

I could not recommend this place more.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: L. B.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My baby loved the playground! I couldn't believe that we could stay there as long as we wanted for only $14!!! Everybody should take their shoes off before entering, which is a great idea for the safety of our little ones. Also, you can take outside drinks and food with you as long as you keep it in the cafe area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tim Northington\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Had 4yr old bday party here today.

Will def recommend to others!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bethany C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great idea for an indoor playground! So many choices for the kids they never got bored. Went for my nieces 1st birthday party. Ages ranged from 1 year to 7 and all the kids had a great time. Clean and bright, toys were nice and well organized. Highly recommended. I didn’t think something like this could be so much fun for the family!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K J\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My 14 mo daughter loved it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janice “Jan” Hartmann\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Reasonably priced and well maintained play place.\n\nWe first visited 5 months ago, and our grandson requested a return visit.\n\nIt's a nice place to allow ones child to play freely and still be in view.\n\nThe place is on the smaller side compared to many other places, yet this is a bonus, especially for young children between the ages of one and three. Older kids might not find it challenging enough, yet for younger children, it's the perfect place to mingle, learn to share and play with other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mari Moreno\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Our family loves this places!

Plus you can see the entire room and keep an eye on the kids without following them around everywhere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Roger Nitti\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I'm a Balloon twister and do birthday parties here often. Always very clean and great family that owns  & runs  it. I recommend it one hundred percent for your kid's birthday.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miesha Tate\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We hosted a dual birthday here for 2nd and 4th Birthday for our Daughter and son. We had to pick 1 theme (they provide plates and some decorations) so we went with Encanto. For our son we brought some of our own decorations and they had no issue with that.\n\nThey have packages that include pizza and drinks as well as either face painting or a character that comes to entertain the kids, we chose the face painting and it was a huge hit!\n\nIt’s also nice they have early time slots for party (I think we chose 10am-12pm) reservations as I find with small kids it’s usually easier to get things done in the morning before they get sleepy and cranky.\n\nThe playground is clean and the service was great.\n\nOne thing to remember is bring your own socks! Adults and kids have to wear socks no shoes allowed inside but if you forget them they are available for purchase at the front.\n\nPopular play items for my kids are the ball pit and the train they can ride around! There’s also dress up that my daughter really loves!\n\nWe also come here regularly just to play, my kids love it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Morgan Baker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Fidgets is a great (and the most affordable) place to have an indoor party! We had our daughter's 2nd birthday here and it was a blast! The toys are all age appropriate and the climbing structure was fun for older kids at the party. It was clean and spacious and I liked that no shoes were allowed. We did the Mickey and Friends theme and the decorations were amazing and it was so lovely to not have to decorate or clean up. Michelle was so friendly and helpful during planning and the party as well. We would definitely recommend this to other parents and consider using Fidgets next year for our daughter's birthday as well!

It’s age appropriate and I’m glad the kids were smaller than him. There’s a lot to do and snacks. The only thing i kind of didn’t like Is how packed it was. There was a ton TON of kids and adults. It was hard to keep an eye on my kid, plus with covid and everything i felt uneasy. But Oh well, the kid enjoyed it so\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evelen Corro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: A fun, clean and great indoor play delight for small kiddos!

He enjoyed his birthday and he had alot of guest that enjoyed themselves too. We had a great turn out and the staff was very helpful the whole time from beginning to end.\nHis theme was Dinosaur and they decorations they did were perfect we did add a few of our own and they all really went well. It looked great.\nI highly recommend this indoor playground for birthdays. Best part is it was closed to public \"only birthday guest \"we had the whole place to ourselves. They offer some really nice add on to we had a photographer come take party pics and pics of the smash cake. We also had a photo booth and had lots of fun with it too. So if you are looking to do a party This Is The Place.\n\nThank Fidgets for a great First Birthday Party.

And it did not disappoint. The play area is huge! There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shunran Zhang\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: Nice and clean place to go with kids, feels like they want to stay here foever❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniella Silverstein\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: This place is so fun for kids.

Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.\nToday is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.\nPlus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)\nIf you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelica Viramontes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Love love love this place!

It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.\n\nI hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sharla Gibson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Nice employees.

Checking out with cashier and she sees my girls in grip socks and says we no longer allow grip socks. This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessenia Gross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I absolutely loved the layout, especially the area with the chairs and the jungle gym – it was perfect for the kids to play and for parents to relax.

Thank you for creating such a wonderful space!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Lealofi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Absolutely amazing experience at this children’s indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how incredibly clean and well-maintained. One worker JADE never stopped cleaning the entire facility. Star is the manager on duty. You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.\n\nOne of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.\n\nWe brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.\n\nHighly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joseph Leday\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I like this place a-lot i take my niece and nephew here all the time and we all have a blast and the employees are very nice and helpful\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sueparat Cameron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Very clean and nice for kids.

The truth is, we went to Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday with my family.\n\nMy son just turned 5 and is very calm and loves playing with role-playing toys, like tents, playhouses, etc.\n\nIt's a great concept, served by a Mexican woman with a wonderful attitude. She and her dad run the business brilliantly, and it's a great time taking the kids while they play safely. You could be working and having a coffee. It's a GREAT option to take the kids if you're already in Las Vegas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Odalis Colon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This indoor playground is a must-visit for toddlers. During our out-of-town visit, my 2-year-old had a fantastic time here. The staff and owners were attentive, helpful, and friendly, fostering a sense of community and love among visitors. Snacks and a seating area were a bonus for energetic kids. The reasonable price point makes this wonderful place an excellent value. Don't forget to bring socks for everyone, including parents.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louven LaHuillier\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: My kids always look forward to going here.

My granddaughter loves Blippi and this place was supposedly highlighted on the show. When we first arrived the man who greeted us was very friendly. However, my daughter and I very disappointed as we thought that the place would be bigger and more modern. My grandbaby goes on a weekly basis to a play gym in Richmond, Virginia that is VERY clean and modern. So, to see this place that was a hodgepodge of old toys, and stuff was a letdown. Most of the toys seemed dirty  and worn. The carpets were stained from apparent throw up and the carpet padding throughout was thin. For a kids play gym the padding should definitely be upgraded. I experienced the lack of padding after I hurt myself coming off on the slide. Overall, the place was very basic and was not worth the half hour drive from across town.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taufique Ahmad\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Small and cozy place for toddlers.

I have an 11-year-old autistic daughter, and the staff's treatment of her was shocking. One of the female employees repeatedly grabbed my daughter aggressively whenever she had food, instead of simply notifying me or any nearby family members. This was completely inappropriate. On top of that, they were obsessively micromanaging their already filthy carpet, and the same woman was spraying cleaning chemicals around the food while my children and guests were eating. To make matters worse, the male employee was incredibly rude, making odd and uncomfortable remarks throughout the event. We all felt highly uncomfortable the entire time. I am genuinely baffled by the positive reviews—there's no way anyone could be satisfied with service like this. I strongly urge to investigate this, as this level of treatment is unacceptable!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Onkar Deep\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My first love\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love this place.

The staff are so kind, and you can tell that they genuinely love kids. The thing that definitely sets this playground apart from the others is that there are super comfortable couches to sit on while you watch your kids. It’s a game changer, especially for someone like myself with a spinal cord injury.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Guenther\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Very crowded when schools are out.

Morciglio\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: When entered this place, a small child walked through the area where an old male employee noticed.  He questioned child's mother about\nit !!!     Kinderland SHOULD have a younger female employee that's a mother; NOT an old man !!!!!   To avoid children from entering that area; there MUST be a small portable gate; which makes common sense !!!!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kinia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I love that place.

Although everything look so nice and well kept up with, my two 3 and 4 year olds would not have had much fun. We did visit on a Saturday it seemed very busy and my husband and I noticed a lot of younger babies. I'd sat ideally this place would be awesome for 6m-2yearolds. I would not feel comfortable alloy 3and 4 year olds running around due to the limited space and with babies all around.  Although I would definitely recommend for parents with children u Der 3\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gleidson lotto Sena\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Yes BETTER\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tui Takai\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We were visiting Vegas, and my kids wanted to go here because Blippi came here, so they enjoyed every minute, and the owners are super kind and playful with the children as well!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pia Pie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: After researching multiple places, I decided to have my daughter's 2nd birthday here and have no regrets.

Price is great too!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordan O.\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It used to be much better than it is. It feels dirty now and very messy. Toys are everywhere, often have hard toys in the ball pit which poses as a hazard. Kids plowing through other kids, throwing balls at them. There isn’t much structure, and I know parents should be watching their own kids but staff should also enforce it more. Their “cafe” is basic snacks and a basic coffee maker, nothing special. We used to love coming here but it isn’t the same.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jazzy b\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Walked in into this place and already felt chaotic. Its understandable that it was busy, and probably came at the peak of it being busy. But me and my husband did not feel welcomed. Nobody greeted, parents just stared at us. We didn’t know who to talk to, there’s was just a lot of conversation everywhere. We started feeling overwhelmed and we walked out. Really disappointed because we don’t live near the area and we drove here to expect our toddler to play here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Luise Cooper\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Franchesca Santiago\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My 2.5 year old son loves this place!

The owners have not changed over these years; they are kind, warm, loving people with the best customer service. This family-owned business is an example of what a family-friendly business should be like. I love them wholeheartedly and have been a nanny for 18 years. I have brought many kids into my care because it is safe, clean, and fun. The owner watches everyone's kids and is always so helpful every day. I highly recommend this indoor playground.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patricia Arevalo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is the most friendly, clean, exceptional children's indoor playground.

We walked in the door, the male worker was arguing with a lady over the insurance waiver. The lady worker told us to fill in the insurance waiver for our 2 year old and then pay at the end. The lady advised no waiver needed for my 8 month old, as he was not crawling and playing on the equipment. My wife and 2 year old entered the play area, I stayed in the enterance to feed my 8 month old. While feeding the male worker was yet again arguing some another customer over the insurance waiver (lady had brought her friends child, and did not have access to previously filled out waiver), this went on for 15 minutes.\n\nAfter my 8 month old was fed, I went and sat in the “cafe” area of the play center with my child and waited for my eldest to finish. As we were nearly done, I went to pay, as my wife was rounding up the 2 year old. The male worker would not take my money until we were actually leaving (this was fine), he then started to question why my 8 month old did not have an Insurance Waiver…$&@? Is this guy for real?….I explained the situation, and he just went on and on and on….at the end, I turned around and said “you either want my money or you don’t”….this is an old man with nothing else to do!\n\nPlay center was not clean, no cafe, small and expensive for what it is. Do not recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucretia Starr\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: The owner is so hands on. It's like being at home. The little ones have such a great time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kas miur (Kasmiur)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Both kids liked playing here.  The 6yr found enough to entertain herself and some other kids to play with, the 13month found some toys also.\n\nStaff is friendly and has some good options for snacks and drinks. As well as different seating options. I like the fact they don't charge for adults, just kids so both parents going doesn't cost additional.\n\nIf you are in Vegas and need to make sure your 1 to 6 year old is tired out, this place will do it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emaan Talks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelssi M.A.\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is great for kids 3 and under.

It’s annoying to watch parents let their kids destroy things intentionally and barely say a word to them. I feel for the front desk who did ask the kids to stop even though it’s the parents responsibility to keep their kid in check and not just ignore what’s happening.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sunny Hills\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This is a very toddler-friendly place, so if you have a child under 5, it’s a great option. However, it may not be as engaging for older kids. Since my son is 1, I find it better suited for us compared to other places. Another big advantage is that they have workstations for parents, with desks and chairs, which is fantastic. I can sometimes get work done while keeping an eye on my child playing nearby. The space is also not too large, making it easier to keep track of my kid because I can spot him quickly. Another perk I appreciate is that they allow outside food and drinks, so I can easily feed my son during playtime.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaydee Zhao\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ana Reclosado\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: It’s a okay place for toddlers\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tom Van Steenkiste\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Super clean place, not sure how pricing stakes up as we were there for a special event.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louven LaHuillier\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: A good sized playplace for my little ones and I can easily see them play about.

While they did have fun, I dont think we'll be returning. Nothing seemed very clean, lots of damaged or broken toys, and toys not in their correct place (and not being returned to their home by staff in the 2 hours we were there.) The poor girl at the front seemed to be alone, handling everything. I get it, she can only do so much. With that, there were also issues of enforcing rules. There were kids eating in the play area, running, taking off socks, and a child almost leaving the building, which I, personally, had to stop and console him while trying to keep track of my own kids. If the price was half as much as Kangamoo, Wally Wombats, or Kids Town I could see past all these things but for the same price, we'll drive a little farther to go someplace that is more kept up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Ho\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chaelin Kwon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We just had our kid's 2nd birthday here.

I would say that this play area is great for kids 6 and under based on the size of the toys and space inside of the play area. Bring your own socks, or you can purchase them for only $2/pair. Very clean as well. Friendly staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Both my kids (ages 1 & 4) love Wigglin out! We have been coming here for years.\n\nWigglin Out is a smaller indoor playground, geared towards younger kids, which I love, because some of the bigger playgrounds are overwhelming for toddlers. The facility is locally owned, spotlessly clean, and the owners/staff are so kind.\n\nWigglin Out is also one of the most reasonably priced indoor playgrounds in Vegas, and they run great specials and host fun events. This is definitely one of our favorite spots for the whole family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R David\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We were in Vegas for a week (end of August) and attended this facility about 4-5 times. We had a fantastic experience. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Most importantly, the facility is more intimate and not as loud/hectic as other indoor playgrounds.\n\nThere are plenty of different toys for children to experience. We really valued that the size was more intimate (it made our children less distracted and not as over stimulated as the louder, super bright/neon/flashy places) but most importantly, this Wigglin' Out is OPEN EARLIER than all the other places.\n\nThe earlier open hours were key because most children are up early so to have to wait until 11 am to start burning off energy is too close to lunch/nap times. Now keep in mind, we were visiting from Canada so I recognize that earlier weekday hours may not be as important for locals.\n\nBut for us, as tourists, this venue was excellent: wonderful customer service, more calm/intimate setting, and better opening hours.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blaine Jasmin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We always have a great time when we come here.

We'll definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Peter Henrie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber U\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lawrence Hoac\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Enok Madrid\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jatarra Pryor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My experience with Wigglin' Out has been a fantastic experience. Chris, the owner, is great with all of the families that enter into the facility. We are all like family in his eyes. He keeps the center clean and organized. The children have a wonderful time and enjoy playing with each other. It is a perfect place to take my toddler as well as take a break and watch her play. I am a first time parent. Finding places that are made just for her is a little bit hard. This place has ample space for the children to explore yet small enough for me to keep my eyes on my little one, while sitting down. I continue to come became my little one loves it so much. It's were she gets her wiggles out. Thank you Chris for always being wonderful to my family. We truly appreciate it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Roger Nitti\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I twisted balloons for a birthday party very nice place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: karla miranda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My son enjoys coming here 😁😁 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charlene K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is awesome!

Overall, it was a good experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey McCallum\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great. I’ve been bringing my daughter since she was 11 months old. They have a young toddler section that is somewhat blocked off and you can safely trap your baby in there. Now that my daughter is 20 months she has so much fun running around, jumping, sliding and playing in the ball pit.\nThis place is a lot cleaner than other indoor playgrounds and I like that it’s not too big so I can keep my eye on her but also give her some space to play.\nThey have comfy couches for parents and an eating area so the kids can enjoy their snacks. The other great thing is you don’t pay by the hour so you can really let your kids burn off all their energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Okay indoor playground but if you have younger kids I would avoid. There are too many older kids (8 or 9 years) playing way too rough around the younger kids, including one who kicked my one year old daughter in the face on purpose.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A CP\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My daughter loves coming here.

Can get crowded but still plenty of space to find something to do. I like that I can follow my son around wherever he goes, since he’s under 2. Clean play area and clean snack/sitting area for the parents. We’ve been back twice now and I plan on purchasing the 10 passes for $85 or the monthly plan. It wasn’t posted anywhere that you had to pay 3 months upfront for the monthly plan (which was $60 or $65 per month, I believe) so heads up on that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Jensen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Donna Peterson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Roxana Dela Cruz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: The best indoor playground.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruba Naddaf\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R PRuley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Took my nieces and nephew here and they had such an awesome time!

He was very excited to see other children. So this mom complained to the front desk about my child instead of making a connection with me and maybe get our children play together. Like cmon my child is still a baby and I’m doing my best to teach him the right way and it’s not like every parent is perfect, we all make mistakes when educating our children. The front desk person was telling me to supervise my child better and tell him the right way to behave. I’m trying to do my mom job and I have a very active baby and I get tired too. I was told in a rude manner as though saying we are not welcomed back. Especially the other mom was a regular customer. I could become a regular Cust too. I need my money back please\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: owln williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Great place. Reserved for our daughters 3rd b-day party.

And so did I! This particular place is GREAT for smaller children since there are a lot of toys geared towards to the \"younger than 5\" age group.  Staff was very nice and inviting and the establishment was very clean. I figured the restroom would be \"questionable\" and even that was very clean. Overall a great experience and I'm sure my daughter and I will visit frequently.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: LOVE THIS PLACE!

The first strike was that they charge for parents to sit and watch the kids. Fine, it's poor customer relations but it's their business to run. Strike two is if you want to go in to watch you must buy their socks even just to sit and watch. When I protested I was told that was their policy and I didn't have to stay if I didn't like it. I didn't and didn't. That was strike three.

I will recommend go on week days if you don't like busy time because it can get super crowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: I have been here multiple times, and I almost booked a birthday party here one year.. but we were in the area so I had decided to play here last Sunday. But we couldn’t even get inside. And after I found out what happened, I will NEVER return.\nThe parking lot had at least 30 cops, and I asked one grandma, as She was being shuffled out of the building, what happened? This is as the police were taping off the parking lot area, and eventually, the front door after hurrying several other people out of there. She told me, “go, get out of here! There was gunfire! Go!” I will absolutely not return after that, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut despite that incident… I would still give this place 1 star because they never keep anything clean. We used to come here a lot, but we had stopped and went to different indoor playgrounds because nearly every time that we would come here, within the next 2-3 days, my kid was sick. And he would end up with an ear infection as a result, and it was really bad. It was at least three separate times that we came to LOL and my son was sick a couple days after.\nMy son was only 2 then, and I was at home with him all the time.. he couldn’t have got sick from anywhere but here as he was not in daycare, and we really didn’t leave the house very much at all, therefore I know that it had to have been at LOL that he got sick. Kids will be running around coughing and sneezing and still playing and touching everything. If your kid is sick you should not bring them out to a place like this, obviously, but soo many people do it anyways! So rude.\n\nThe staff could have done temperate checks during cold/flu season? Or if they saw an obviously sick child, ask the family to leave and sanitize the area? But you don’t see the staff ever cleaning anything here. The tables are a mess a lot of the time, the play area is worse. They only walk around with a leaf blower to “clean” up the ballpit balls that have gone astray. Never seen anyone wipe anything down.\nYou can tell they don’t really care to clean much of the many surfaces because obvious shoe marks, dirt, etc. all over the play area and floor. The ball pit balls feel disgusting and greasy. It’s the worst on the high levels of the play area. I’ve climbed to the very top which is very high up and that’s where it looks the dirtiest, probably because it’s not as accessible as the ground floor and most parents aren’t up there to notice. But why are there dirty shoe marks when it is a “socks only” facility anyways?!\n\nIt is too bad the staff/owner don’t really care, because this place would be great if I was just judging the playground equipment! Unfortunately, they allow in what I feel like is more than their capacity should be, and the place is flooded with kids running left and right, no staff supervision anywhere at all, and they don’t clean a thing afterwards.\nThe owners obviously don’t care to change their policies and improve this place as I’ve seen numerous other reviews that were recently posted.\nOverall they lack sanitation for a children’s facility and we saw the aftermath of an extremely dangerous hazard in a children’s play place… so thankful we weren’t inside when this occurred and I hope everyone was okay.\nI hope they get shut down after this incident, it is so not ok for this to have been happening at a place for kids. If they stay open I think they should install metal detectors & hire a decent cleaning crew to sanitize this place.\nWill never return ever. I already avoided coming here when my kid would ask, instead I’d suggest a different indoor playground, but now it will be a hard no.\nI wouldn’t have even came here today in the first place, but we happened to be nearby on that side of town, so I said fine we will go.\nBut driving there, I kept telling my son, don’t put your hands in your mouth or on your face, unless you want to get sick!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scuba Steve\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Great place for the kids, good choice of food and snacks. I really wish they run the AC a bit cooler in this place though, those kids be coming out looking like they came from the pool... I get they are running around but the amount of bodies the room gets warm fast. Especially its summer now with 100+ degrees outside inside should be cool. As a parent just sitting in the dining area its warm..\n\nThis place is one of the better bigger indoor play area in the southwest.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelique Garcia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: American first Investment group\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My kids live going here.

There are plastic balls everywhere, many of them cracked and no staff in the playing area at all to monitor. Extremely dirty due to zero maintenance. On top of that the girl at check in was so unprofessional - charged me extra and when I mentioned it after I looked at the rates, she just rolled her eyes and said I should have told her before making payment and that she can’t do anything now. Was unbelievable and so apalling! When I asked if there is someone else I can talk to, she just said there isn’t any supervisor/manager. No apology and zero people’s skills.  She either hated her job or was just a bad person.\nI had my kids with me so I went in even though I didn’t want to. I called their customer service line the same night and I was assured the manager will call me in the morning but no one called and it’s been almost a month now.\nHence I am writing this review as it is clear that the problem is not just employees but the business itself.

There are children of all ages big and small running at full speed around this small area with no regards to their surroundings even on the concrete where the seating area is located which is a major safety concern since everyone is in socks, I guess thats why you have to sign a waiver prior to entering this danger zone. There is no staff supervision, rule enforcement, limtiation on the number of people inside, no staff picking up the balls that are sacttered in the sitting area which is again all concrete. The food is over priced and definitely not worth it, nothing comes out as it is on the pictures. I ordered Juju nacho supreme wish i would have taken a pic for comparison before throwing them away. In the picture on the menu it shows beef on the nachos, it was given to me with chopped up chicken strips and  none of the toppings on the picture. There is no description of whats on anything just a name and a picture. Great concept for a play place but definitely needs some work!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Etene L Taimalelagi\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Came here last Sunday 2/16/25 with my 2 grandchildren. I mean the kids had fun that’s the main thing.\n\nMy complaint was that the snack bar prices are way too high.  I ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches which had to be ordered as part of a combo meal. No alacart option.  And it came up to around $42.33.  This cost more than the admission for my two grandkids.  They didn’t have an option to pay in any other form except Zelle…I thought that was peculiar since the snack bar accepted debit/credit…\n\nBottom- line is that I don’t think we’ll be patronizing this establishment again.\n\nStaff-\nFront desk staff were apologetic about having to send a Zelle payment for admission.  For the most part type two gals were friendly and courteous.\n\nCafe staff.\n5/10 for service and value\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Villavicencio\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Beware. EVERYONE must remove shoes to enter. Yes even adults. Make sure you're wearing socks with grip on them for safety. Was invited to a birthday party and the floor in the room was very slippery. Many slips happened, including me. Yes you sign a waiver to enter. Now I see why. Fun place for kids, but this is just one big injury/lawsuit waiting to happen. Now imagine having to go into the public bathroom, in your socks. I did not want to try that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charde Kelly\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I was extremely disappointed with our experience at LOL Kids Club in Las Vegas. It’s supposed to be a fun and inclusive place for children, but unfortunately, we experienced clear discrimination during our visit. The staff treated us unfairly compared to other guests, and when we brought up our concerns, they were dismissive and unhelpful. No family should have to deal with this kind of treatment, especially in a place meant for kids to feel safe and welcome. I will not be returning, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately.\n\nThe Arabic man who says he is the manager is horrible. Looked my two 6 year olds and 1 year old in the face and told them he wasn’t letting them in and they were not going to play today.  Do not bring your children. Children do not deserve this verbal abuse.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karrianna Siv\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: If this place can get a 0 rating, it would have been given quickly! This was my first and it will certainly be my last. They expects you to take your shoes off as soon as you get in but their restroom is filthy! I ordered food and found hair in my food. When I addressed it to the lady in the kitchen she didn’t apologize or offer anything else. She just stated “okay” and walked away… Save your money, time, and energy for a place where it not only be cleaned/sanitized but who can be kind! Kindness goes a long way!!\n\nOriginally, I rated a 1 star ⭐️ However, I brought it up to a 3. I believe it was the manager that came back and refunded me for my onion rings that had hair in it. I appreciate the effort to try and make things right. That’s an honorable thing he did and I thank him for coming to speak with me and asked if there was anything else he can do for me.\n\nWhile I felt like the situation was handled inappropriately. I would like to send my sincere apology to the young woman who walked away. I’m learning that people have different responding mechanisms. But want to extend my thank you for bringing it up to management attention to help make things right.\n\nBut please, clean your restrooms and floors. Help keep our community healthy.\n\nThanks!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Randy Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Arto M\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Staff is very rude and disrespectful.

Plastic box for shoes is very limited in this place.\nAnd be aware for entry rate. 2 parents with 2 kids in a single payment transaction is more expensive then 2 separate charges (1adult+1child). They rip you off if you dont pay your attention.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gianna Griffin\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My daughter recently hosted my twin granddaughter's birthday party at LOL Kids, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place. My daughter paid $1600 for their Ultimate Package, which included 3 rooms, food (8 large pizzas, 2 appetizer platters, 2 salad platters), unlimited drinks, and icee treats for the kids. While the price was hefty, we expected great service and a smooth experience for such a special occasion – but that wasn’t the case.\n\nIssues we faced:\n1.\tShoes Policy Problems: Upon arrival, we were told all adults had to remove their shoes. This included elders and people with health issues who would be sitting the entire time. We had to argue with staff to get waivers to allow our elderly family members to keep their shoes on, which should have been handled more gracefully.\n\n2.\tRoom Mix-Up: To our surprise, when we got to our reserved rooms, they were given away to another party. We spent nearly 45 minutes sorting this out, and the issue wasn’t resolved until we spoke with the owner. The excuse they gave was that they thought we were part of another party, but no one bothered to confirm anything. It was very frustrating, and we didn’t even get into our rooms until an hour after the scheduled party time. As compensation for the inconvenience, the owner gave us a frozen tiramisu cake and two fruit trays – hardly an adequate fix.\n\n3.\tPoor Food and Service: The service at the party was subpar. The host was unprofessional, and we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks and inquire about the food. We were given random food substitutions, like ranch dressing instead of the Caesar dressing we ordered. When we asked the staff about it, they acted like they didn’t know what we were talking about, and one of the workers at the register admitted they had just run out of the correct dressing. Additionally, we had to keep asking for plates, cups, and basic items, which seemed to annoy the host.\n\nFor the amount of money we paid, we expected much better service and attention to detail. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing a positive experience.\nFinal Thoughts: If you’re planning to book a party for your children here, be prepared for potential stress and poor service. The lack of professionalism, mix-ups with reservations, and inattentiveness from the staff made this a frustrating and disappointing experience. For the price, there are certainly better venues that will respect your time, money, and your child’s special day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olga Kukuk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Benjamin “nonprofithow” Everhart\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Go here!

Both kids and grown ups could play. Food was pretty good. Definitely worth the price. UNFORTUNATELY, at the bottom of the big red slide in the ball pit I found my 2 year old daughter playing with this knife. Thankfully it was closed, but I can't even imagine if it was open and my kid or another slid down onto it. Ended up getting sidetracked with my kid running away and forgot to mention it to a worker, I wish I did. Anyway, I feel that they should have someone regularly checking the ball pits and play areas for things like this. It makes sense that ANYTHING can fall out of ANYONES pockets here, it should be regularly checked. Place was fun, a bit run down, but finding the knife definitely was not. 2/5 stars for that reason.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rose Cherry Anderson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Johnny Reyes\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Place is a total scam now.

I've been to this children's play place more than once, and my previous experience was disappointing due to the cleanliness of the play area and the staff's attitude. We let a Groupon expire because I didn’t want to return. But after my daughter kept asking to go for the last two weeks, I figured we’d give it another shot, hoping it had improved. Unfortunately, it’s worse than ever.\n\nWe visited on Saturday, 8/24/24, meeting friends for a playdate when the place opened. After letting the kids (both 5 years old) settle in, we sat down, periodically checking on them. The floors in the seating areas were filthy, covered in shoe and sock prints, and this was right after opening. Then, my daughter came over and told me she stepped on glass. Shocked, I asked her to show me where. Meanwhile, her friend showed her mom a small injury she had gotten while trying to avoid the glass, causing her to fall and land on the glass, which ripped her new leggings and cut her knee, making it bleed.\n\nI walked over and saw glass scattered everywhere near the front windows. Another parent mentioned that their child had found the rock that had clearly broken the window. When my friend asked for a bandaid and the staff saw her daughter's bleeding leg, they told her it had already been cleaned up. I then informed them that was definitely not the case; glass was still all over the mats. This is a play place where kids are required to wear socks only. One child was already bleeding, and that was the staff’s response? A few of us parents started using toys to barricade off the area because the glass had spread over a large area. There was no urgency from the staff; they eventually came over with brooms and said, \"It's not our fault people keep breaking our windows.\" True, it’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to maintain a safe environment for the kids.\n\nDespite our concerns, the girls wanted to keep playing, so we kept them away from that area. The staff’s cleaning efforts were inadequate—they didn’t even bother to get a vacuum to clean up the shards of glass on the mats. They removed our barricades. It wasn’t until the owner arrived later that the staff finally brought out a shop vac and sealed the window to clean up the glass properly. Yet, the owner never checked in with my friend to see how her daughter was doing.\n\nWhen our kids got hungry, we ordered food: one large pizza and an order of chicken spring rolls. The food took a long time to arrive. When I bit into the spring rolls, I found a triangular piece of bone inside the chopped chicken. I took multiple pictures as proof. Then I noticed a rash on my friend’s daughter, which hadn’t been there before. That was the last straw; we decided it was time to go.\n\nThis place is a disaster—the staff is terrible, and there’s zero regulation on older kids roughhousing. An older boy, maybe 8-10 years old, was grabbing my daughter’s hands in the ball pit, and I had to intervene calmly. No parents were in sight.\n\nWhen you go to a play place, there’s an expectation of cleanliness, kindness, and safety—this place has none of those. To top it off, only one sink in the women’s bathroom worked, the paper towel dispenser handle was broken, one toilet was out of order, and another was clogged. The toys, like the large Legos and the balls, were filthy, and even my daughter mentioned that the slides were dirty.\n\nWe had to explain to our girls that we were leaving because it wasn’t safe—between the broken glass, the bone in my food, and the rash, it was time to go and never come back. I’ve mentioned this experience to other mom friends, and they all had horrible things to say about this place. I have no idea how this place is still open; it needs to be shut down.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Martika Elliott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: It's a cool experience for me and my son\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruslan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Menakhi K Henu Jay\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: The main thing that matters is that my boy had a great time.

Admission is reasonable. Cashier in the front didn’t give us wrist bands so that made leaving confusing. Food was pricey but decent, took almost an hour before we got our food and partially due to them not properly putting phone number in for text notification. Kids had a lot of fun though. I feel like there should be staff walking through checking on kids cause it is a big area and to try to keep balls in their areas as it is a tripping hazard. This area is so big you can lose a kiddo and if they don’t actually check wristbands/neglect to give them then I feel this could be a major safety hazard. I do like that you have unlimited play time though unlike other places we have gone to.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucy Deng\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have so much fun in here！\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kailani Benavides\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: everything is good but the pizza is very expensive and bad\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Guenther\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Great place and your kids will love it.

Came here with my son my sister and nephew on Memorial Day the man that checked us in gave me a really hard time because we wanted to pay separately instead of together to avoid the additional $7.95 charge for an adult. He made me put my son’s water cup in the dirty shoe bin because water was “not allowed.” Upon entering I noticed water canteens on almost every table so I went back and brought this to his attention where he then gave me my son’s water cup back. Very strange. I’m 7 months pregnant and wanted to take my son to do something fun and in turn I come here just to feel super stressed out and uncomfortable by a grumpy employee. Super disappointing. Bathrooms are completely disgusting as well, brown on the walls in the stall. So it seems that the staff was concerned with my son’s water bottle than anything else!

My issue was with their policy on charging adults. I arrived with friends, each accompanied by their own child. When we were asked if we came together, I said yes and offered to pay for everyone, expecting my friends to reimburse me later. Despite each adult having their own child and us all signing waivers, they insisted on charging me for four adults simply because we arrived as a group. I questioned why we had to pay extra when they weren’t providing any additional care for our kids. They replied it was their policy for group arrivals. Frustrated, I requested a refund and went to Kangamoo at Sunset instead.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anny Smyth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nima Lhaden\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sophia Marielle\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: employees gave so much attitude i didn't like their energy\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Breen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I would like to express my appreciation for the professional and courteous service provided by the front desk staff, particularly the young man who was also observed diligently vacuuming the kitchen.

Waited 45 minutes for a quesadilla and chicken sandwich.  The bathroom was disgusting and we arrived near opening so it was not restocked from the night before or cleaned.  Leaking toilets while wearing socks, there are sandals but no sign if for public use so was unsure who's they were.  The machines for the kids to use in the play area were broken or lacking power to where the balls would not shoot out or power up.  The games seemed expensive, $1 for 2 tokens.\n\nOverall I'd say it was ok.

It's a very large play place, and sometimes, when it's too busy, the little ones get hurt/run over by older kids. All the kids, for the most part, appeared to be under 6 when I was there.  The jungle gym is big enough that a parent is able to climb through it as well. Seemed pretty clean, didn't go to the restrooms which I hate because you're in socks only. They have some arcade games, but after spending $18 to get in, it can get expensive playing games. The birthday space I wasn't impressed with simply because it's all linked together in one large room.  Just rows of tables, maybe 10 - 15, so you don't have a personal space. You're behind glass separated from the general public, but not from anyone else having a birthday party at the same time. There's plenty of seating available for parents while the kids play, and the snack bar has a nice variety of items. Pricing wise they're high, but it's a play place so I expected it. It was almost $7 for a small slurpee (6 or 8oz I believe) and bottle of water.  The air guns in the playpen weren't working and there are several of them. Looked like no one had checked them to see because balls were stuck in them that weren't intended for the guns. I wasn't able to pull them out, and even guns that had nothing stuck in them weren't working either. Overall, my daughter enjoyed herself so I'd definitely go back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mariah Zaste\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids always have a blast the food is mid but the kids love it and I love the massaging chairs\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Banks\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Used to love this place years ago...it's went downhill since...not the cleanest at all.

I hadn't been in a few years, and took my three kids last week. The employees do a good job of keeping everything picked up and clean on the surface... But this place needs a deep cleaning BAD! The entire playground area had a faint smell of urine, and everything has a layer of grime on it. I was really iffy about letting my one year old climb on things, and sure enough he ended up sick. Half the stuff was broken (one of the trampolines, the zipline, etc), BUT, my kids still had a blast. In all honesty though, I'll probably just choose a different playground next time that I know is very clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Sissons\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing!

The staff is friendly and does a great job of keeping the play area clean and the bathrooms clean. They also sell diapers for the little ones and all three bathrooms have changing tables. I will definitely be coming back here every time I am in Las Vegas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evora Evoraa\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This playground has honestly been the worst experience for my daughter . My daughter has gotten sick here multiple times , they aren’t very sanitary , I’ve been missing months for it to be better but nope workers sitting on their bum selfs on their phones not cleaning play area at all some how it gets dirtier each day it’s a socks only howww ? yes I understand it’s a playground for children but it’s also very hazardous , there’s a lot of broken things , broken steps and a window where my daughter was about to fall from . There’s been so many concerns for me , children aggressively pushing my daughter , calling her stupid , mothers fighting amongst each other , the staff works for nothing and doesn’t ever intervene . I’ve escalated my concerns with the owner and she has shown no interest whatsoever, instead of providing solutions for her playground she just says her workers aren’t police officers ? She has also mentioned that she plans on not having any maintenance done to the playground not even within a year as she also made it known that she was the cheapest and best in town and actually planned on raising her prices , you can’t even express your concerns to the workers because you get strikes as a customer ? She has also just said other places are better than hers while giving the excuse of her playground being old ? Half of the place is torn down lady. Overall such an awful option , I originally opted towards this playground because of how conveniently close it was to my house but I will be resorting to anything and everything else for the best experience for my daughter . I had the year membership and gave these issues time to be resolved and they just worsened . I recommend Wally Wombats , it’s only $5 more for the annual membership and it’s an overall better alternative . Good Luck to kangamoo\n\nPhoto credits to Mealexc S.

Centrally located and easy to access, it’s filled with exciting activities geared toward younger children. The playground is very clean and well-maintained, which immediately put us at ease as the kids explored the slides, climbing structures, and interactive areas. They enjoyed every minute, darting from one play zone to the next with endless energy. The welcoming environment and thoughtful setup made this a delightful outing for everyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christopher Walter\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: 14 bucks for each child for 3 hours.

My one year old was crying desperately and I was just trying to feed him with ONE GRAPE to calm him, but immediately they told me that outside food wasn’t allowed inside (only their junk food of course). They couldn’t wait for the baby to calm down. Also, this employee was always speaking on the speakers telling kids what not to do. Very annoying. If in spaces for kids there’s no compassion and kindness, where are we supposed to go?\nIt’s a nice structure though, and I bet with different management it would be a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joshua Segal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 11 months ago\nReview: Great idea, location, friendliness of staff, and affordable.

Most of the time have children in them as well and it went from $10to $14 per child I've since been to many other places and see there's better but it's still ok for people who it works for and that's why I still give 4stars\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David (QuasiDave)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great indoor play area for kids.

Don't Bring Your Little Kids Here!\nI brought my 3 year old here today and it's full of adults barreling down the slides head-first (without kids) and teenagers bullying little kids on the trampoline. The big kids - far too old to be there were boisterous and dangerous, pushing little ones over. It isn't a place for little kids.\n\nNot to mention there were FAR too many people in there - clearly part-time parents and their family members. There should be limits to two adults per kid.\nThere was a 350lb man up on the climbing frame net area making the whole thing creak and shake and the useless TEEN staff (clearly management doesn't want to pay adults!) couldn't manage anything. It is a matter of time until that comes down on someone's head.\n\nThe whole place is a disaster and danger to children. There should be an upper age restriction on how old kids can be to enter - it's not a place for the over 10s and this was being exploited because of the useless management.\n\nThe running around of a 5-year-old does not have the same momentum as a ten-year-old running around, ploughing into little ones. Again, the little mouse voices from 'management' did nothing and the trash parents were more interested in their phones than watching their kids. Upon entry, they should be spoken to about watching their kids, not to let them bully and over tens should be turned away.\n\nAlso, their toxic stamp takes 60 years to remove and will make my kid's arm red in the bathtub, trying to get it off.\n\nAvoid. At all costs. It's a matter of time until a kid is really hurt - or worse at this clown show and they get sued into oblivion regardless of their stupid waiver or signs, that no one reads.\nIf I could rate it minus stars, I would.\nWe will never be back and we'll be telling other parents to avoid the place too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Shafer\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fix your parents area.

So I went back on December 20th and to my disappointment, the two attendants who are in the courtyard were exclusively looking after a single child and that same child wanted me to take my daughter out of Jump so she could feel comfortable. obviously I didn't take it away, it's a collective space. Then these two attendants went down the slide with that same child. They were taking exclusive care of her and in the end they even made a balloon flower, ignoring all the children who were in the space. Then my daughter chose a snack, but I was without my wallet waiting for my husband to arrive in 10 minutes and the attendant was super rude saying that I couldn't open the snack package without first having to pay $1. My daughter is autistic and was very upset by the situation. If I paid $14 why wouldn't I pay $1. and he was still mocking. I will not return to this place again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaime Monroy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patricia Shelton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Grandson's third birthday party it was awesome all kids all ages very happy\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veronica Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We went here for a 3 year old birthday party and we were beyond impressed.

For today Nov. 11th. At the time of booking I was told IF more than 15 kids showed I would be charged for the 22 child count party. OK not a problem.\n\nI was also told we would get 2 full hours in the party room.\n\nWhen I arrived today I was CHARGED for the 22 child party as soon as I walk through the door. They did not even wait for the head count. Then also asked for a TIP. Right as we arrived.\n\nThe employees could have cared less about helping us set up the party!!!\n\nThe \"party host\" with the party was virtually none existent. We did basically everything ourselves from set up to clean up!\n\nWhen the party was about over we were told to vacate the party room before the party for even over. BEFORE the 2 hour mark! The hostess finally showed up and said we could stay additional time for another $50.00.\n\nWhen I went to the cashier she number 1 refused to give us out money back because it was a 15 child party not 22.\n\nSecondly, she refused to give us an additional few mintues in the party room that the hostess communicated we could pay for.\n\nNOT one person was kind or courteous. There was very poor communication.

They refuse to give me a new pass (and you can clearly tell the pass has never been used) or refund the $95 spent on it. I was shrugged at and told they’ve had people have their whole cars stolen and won’t replace it. We will not be back and will not support a place that operates like this. What’s the point of having us sign a log book upon purchase of the pass if you can’t track it? I’m a Nanny that has been here with lots of kids here and we will not be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A C\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Helena Donker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for parents  and kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: quantumous\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just like childhood.

Strike two is if you want to go in to watch you must buy their socks even just to sit and watch. When I protested I was told that was their policy and I didn't have to stay if I didn't like it.

I will recommend go on week days if you don't like busy time because it can get super crowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: I have been here multiple times, and I almost booked a birthday party here one year.. but we were in the area so I had decided to play here last Sunday. But we couldn’t even get inside. And after I found out what happened, I will NEVER return.\nThe parking lot had at least 30 cops, and I asked one grandma, as She was being shuffled out of the building, what happened? This is as the police were taping off the parking lot area, and eventually, the front door after hurrying several other people out of there. She told me, “go, get out of here! There was gunfire! Go!” I will absolutely not return after that, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut despite that incident… I would still give this place 1 star because they never keep anything clean. We used to come here a lot, but we had stopped and went to different indoor playgrounds because nearly every time that we would come here, within the next 2-3 days, my kid was sick. And he would end up with an ear infection as a result, and it was really bad. It was at least three separate times that we came to LOL and my son was sick a couple days after.\nMy son was only 2 then, and I was at home with him all the time.. he couldn’t have got sick from anywhere but here as he was not in daycare, and we really didn’t leave the house very much at all, therefore I know that it had to have been at LOL that he got sick. Kids will be running around coughing and sneezing and still playing and touching everything. If your kid is sick you should not bring them out to a place like this, obviously, but soo many people do it anyways! So rude.\n\nThe staff could have done temperate checks during cold/flu season? Or if they saw an obviously sick child, ask the family to leave and sanitize the area? But you don’t see the staff ever cleaning anything here. The tables are a mess a lot of the time, the play area is worse. They only walk around with a leaf blower to “clean” up the ballpit balls that have gone astray. Never seen anyone wipe anything down.\nYou can tell they don’t really care to clean much of the many surfaces because obvious shoe marks, dirt, etc. all over the play area and floor. The ball pit balls feel disgusting and greasy. It’s the worst on the high levels of the play area. I’ve climbed to the very top which is very high up and that’s where it looks the dirtiest, probably because it’s not as accessible as the ground floor and most parents aren’t up there to notice. But why are there dirty shoe marks when it is a “socks only” facility anyways?!\n\nIt is too bad the staff/owner don’t really care, because this place would be great if I was just judging the playground equipment! Unfortunately, they allow in what I feel like is more than their capacity should be, and the place is flooded with kids running left and right, no staff supervision anywhere at all, and they don’t clean a thing afterwards.\nThe owners obviously don’t care to change their policies and improve this place as I’ve seen numerous other reviews that were recently posted.\nOverall they lack sanitation for a children’s facility and we saw the aftermath of an extremely dangerous hazard in a children’s play place… so thankful we weren’t inside when this occurred and I hope everyone was okay.\nI hope they get shut down after this incident, it is so not ok for this to have been happening at a place for kids. If they stay open I think they should install metal detectors & hire a decent cleaning crew to sanitize this place.\nWill never return ever. I already avoided coming here when my kid would ask, instead I’d suggest a different indoor playground, but now it will be a hard no.\nI wouldn’t have even came here today in the first place, but we happened to be nearby on that side of town, so I said fine we will go.\nBut driving there, I kept telling my son, don’t put your hands in your mouth or on your face, unless you want to get sick!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scuba Steve\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Great place for the kids, good choice of food and snacks. I really wish they run the AC a bit cooler in this place though, those kids be coming out looking like they came from the pool... I get they are running around but the amount of bodies the room gets warm fast. Especially its summer now with 100+ degrees outside inside should be cool.

There are plastic balls everywhere, many of them cracked and no staff in the playing area at all to monitor. Extremely dirty due to zero maintenance. On top of that the girl at check in was so unprofessional - charged me extra and when I mentioned it after I looked at the rates, she just rolled her eyes and said I should have told her before making payment and that she can’t do anything now. Was unbelievable and so apalling! When I asked if there is someone else I can talk to, she just said there isn’t any supervisor/manager. No apology and zero people’s skills.  She either hated her job or was just a bad person.\nI had my kids with me so I went in even though I didn’t want to. I called their customer service line the same night and I was assured the manager will call me in the morning but no one called and it’s been almost a month now.\nHence I am writing this review as it is clear that the problem is not just employees but the business itself. I definitely am not returning and want to warn others as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carlos Herrera-Briones\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: this place is totally not worth it. machines don't work. and guy started the leaf blower at the end to kick everyone out. very rood people\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Bohannon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Transformed Nichole\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My children enjoyed themselves when they werent slipping on balls that were literally ALL over the place or getting balls thrown in their face by other peoples children who were not being supervised. This place has no safety percautions in place AT ALL. There are children of all ages big and small running at full speed around this small area with no regards to their surroundings even on the concrete where the seating area is located which is a major safety concern since everyone is in socks, I guess thats why you have to sign a waiver prior to entering this danger zone. There is no staff supervision, rule enforcement, limtiation on the number of people inside, no staff picking up the balls that are sacttered in the sitting area which is again all concrete. The food is over priced and definitely not worth it, nothing comes out as it is on the pictures. I ordered Juju nacho supreme wish i would have taken a pic for comparison before throwing them away. In the picture on the menu it shows beef on the nachos, it was given to me with chopped up chicken strips and  none of the toppings on the picture. There is no description of whats on anything just a name and a picture. Great concept for a play place but definitely needs some work!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Etene L Taimalelagi\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Came here last Sunday 2/16/25 with my 2 grandchildren. I mean the kids had fun that’s the main thing.\n\nMy complaint was that the snack bar prices are way too high.  I ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches which had to be ordered as part of a combo meal. No alacart option.  And it came up to around $42.33.  This cost more than the admission for my two grandkids.  They didn’t have an option to pay in any other form except Zelle…I thought that was peculiar since the snack bar accepted debit/credit…\n\nBottom- line is that I don’t think we’ll be patronizing this establishment again.\n\nStaff-\nFront desk staff were apologetic about having to send a Zelle payment for admission.  For the most part type two gals were friendly and courteous.\n\nCafe staff.\n5/10 for service and value\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Villavicencio\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Beware. EVERYONE must remove shoes to enter. Yes even adults. Make sure you're wearing socks with grip on them for safety. Was invited to a birthday party and the floor in the room was very slippery. Many slips happened, including me. Yes you sign a waiver to enter. Now I see why. Fun place for kids, but this is just one big injury/lawsuit waiting to happen. Now imagine having to go into the public bathroom, in your socks. I did not want to try that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charde Kelly\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I was extremely disappointed with our experience at LOL Kids Club in Las Vegas. It’s supposed to be a fun and inclusive place for children, but unfortunately, we experienced clear discrimination during our visit. The staff treated us unfairly compared to other guests, and when we brought up our concerns, they were dismissive and unhelpful. No family should have to deal with this kind of treatment, especially in a place meant for kids to feel safe and welcome. I will not be returning, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately.\n\nThe Arabic man who says he is the manager is horrible. Looked my two 6 year olds and 1 year old in the face and told them he wasn’t letting them in and they were not going to play today.  Do not bring your children. Children do not deserve this verbal abuse.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karrianna Siv\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: If this place can get a 0 rating, it would have been given quickly! This was my first and it will certainly be my last. They expects you to take your shoes off as soon as you get in but their restroom is filthy! I ordered food and found hair in my food. When I addressed it to the lady in the kitchen she didn’t apologize or offer anything else. She just stated “okay” and walked away… Save your money, time, and energy for a place where it not only be cleaned/sanitized but who can be kind! Kindness goes a long way!!\n\nOriginally, I rated a 1 star ⭐️ However, I brought it up to a 3. I believe it was the manager that came back and refunded me for my onion rings that had hair in it. I appreciate the effort to try and make things right. That’s an honorable thing he did and I thank him for coming to speak with me and asked if there was anything else he can do for me.\n\nWhile I felt like the situation was handled inappropriately. I would like to send my sincere apology to the young woman who walked away. I’m learning that people have different responding mechanisms. But want to extend my thank you for bringing it up to management attention to help make things right.\n\nBut please, clean your restrooms and floors. Help keep our community healthy.\n\nThanks!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Randy Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Arto M\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Staff is very rude and disrespectful. I and my wife went there with our 2 kids and ask additional box for shoes and jackets because all staff wasn't fit in one. Answer shocked me - \"one box per family\". Can u imagine? Plastic box for shoes is very limited in this place.\nAnd be aware for entry rate. 2 parents with 2 kids in a single payment transaction is more expensive then 2 separate charges (1adult+1child). They rip you off if you dont pay your attention.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gianna Griffin\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My daughter recently hosted my twin granddaughter's birthday party at LOL Kids, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place. My daughter paid $1600 for their Ultimate Package, which included 3 rooms, food (8 large pizzas, 2 appetizer platters, 2 salad platters), unlimited drinks, and icee treats for the kids. While the price was hefty, we expected great service and a smooth experience for such a special occasion – but that wasn’t the case.\n\nIssues we faced:\n1.\tShoes Policy Problems: Upon arrival, we were told all adults had to remove their shoes. This included elders and people with health issues who would be sitting the entire time. We had to argue with staff to get waivers to allow our elderly family members to keep their shoes on, which should have been handled more gracefully.\n\n2.\tRoom Mix-Up: To our surprise, when we got to our reserved rooms, they were given away to another party. We spent nearly 45 minutes sorting this out, and the issue wasn’t resolved until we spoke with the owner. The excuse they gave was that they thought we were part of another party, but no one bothered to confirm anything. It was very frustrating, and we didn’t even get into our rooms until an hour after the scheduled party time. As compensation for the inconvenience, the owner gave us a frozen tiramisu cake and two fruit trays – hardly an adequate fix.\n\n3.\tPoor Food and Service: The service at the party was subpar. The host was unprofessional, and we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks and inquire about the food. We were given random food substitutions, like ranch dressing instead of the Caesar dressing we ordered. When we asked the staff about it, they acted like they didn’t know what we were talking about, and one of the workers at the register admitted they had just run out of the correct dressing. Additionally, we had to keep asking for plates, cups, and basic items, which seemed to annoy the host.\n\nFor the amount of money we paid, we expected much better service and attention to detail. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing a positive experience.\nFinal Thoughts: If you’re planning to book a party for your children here, be prepared for potential stress and poor service. The lack of professionalism, mix-ups with reservations, and inattentiveness from the staff made this a frustrating and disappointing experience.

Both kids and grown ups could play. Food was pretty good. Definitely worth the price. UNFORTUNATELY, at the bottom of the big red slide in the ball pit I found my 2 year old daughter playing with this knife. Thankfully it was closed, but I can't even imagine if it was open and my kid or another slid down onto it. Ended up getting sidetracked with my kid running away and forgot to mention it to a worker, I wish I did. Anyway, I feel that they should have someone regularly checking the ball pits and play areas for things like this. It makes sense that ANYTHING can fall out of ANYONES pockets here, it should be regularly checked. Place was fun, a bit run down, but finding the knife definitely was not. 2/5 stars for that reason.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rose Cherry Anderson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Johnny Reyes\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Place is a total scam now.

I've been to this children's play place more than once, and my previous experience was disappointing due to the cleanliness of the play area and the staff's attitude. We let a Groupon expire because I didn’t want to return. But after my daughter kept asking to go for the last two weeks, I figured we’d give it another shot, hoping it had improved. Unfortunately, it’s worse than ever.\n\nWe visited on Saturday, 8/24/24, meeting friends for a playdate when the place opened. After letting the kids (both 5 years old) settle in, we sat down, periodically checking on them. The floors in the seating areas were filthy, covered in shoe and sock prints, and this was right after opening. Then, my daughter came over and told me she stepped on glass. Shocked, I asked her to show me where. Meanwhile, her friend showed her mom a small injury she had gotten while trying to avoid the glass, causing her to fall and land on the glass, which ripped her new leggings and cut her knee, making it bleed.\n\nI walked over and saw glass scattered everywhere near the front windows. Another parent mentioned that their child had found the rock that had clearly broken the window. When my friend asked for a bandaid and the staff saw her daughter's bleeding leg, they told her it had already been cleaned up. I then informed them that was definitely not the case; glass was still all over the mats. This is a play place where kids are required to wear socks only. One child was already bleeding, and that was the staff’s response? A few of us parents started using toys to barricade off the area because the glass had spread over a large area. There was no urgency from the staff; they eventually came over with brooms and said, \"It's not our fault people keep breaking our windows.\" True, it’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to maintain a safe environment for the kids.\n\nDespite our concerns, the girls wanted to keep playing, so we kept them away from that area. The staff’s cleaning efforts were inadequate—they didn’t even bother to get a vacuum to clean up the shards of glass on the mats. They removed our barricades. It wasn’t until the owner arrived later that the staff finally brought out a shop vac and sealed the window to clean up the glass properly. Yet, the owner never checked in with my friend to see how her daughter was doing.\n\nWhen our kids got hungry, we ordered food: one large pizza and an order of chicken spring rolls. The food took a long time to arrive. When I bit into the spring rolls, I found a triangular piece of bone inside the chopped chicken. I took multiple pictures as proof. Then I noticed a rash on my friend’s daughter, which hadn’t been there before. That was the last straw; we decided it was time to go.\n\nThis place is a disaster—the staff is terrible, and there’s zero regulation on older kids roughhousing. An older boy, maybe 8-10 years old, was grabbing my daughter’s hands in the ball pit, and I had to intervene calmly. No parents were in sight.\n\nWhen you go to a play place, there’s an expectation of cleanliness, kindness, and safety—this place has none of those. To top it off, only one sink in the women’s bathroom worked, the paper towel dispenser handle was broken, one toilet was out of order, and another was clogged. The toys, like the large Legos and the balls, were filthy, and even my daughter mentioned that the slides were dirty.\n\nWe had to explain to our girls that we were leaving because it wasn’t safe—between the broken glass, the bone in my food, and the rash, it was time to go and never come back. I’ve mentioned this experience to other mom friends, and they all had horrible things to say about this place. I have no idea how this place is still open; it needs to be shut down.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Martika Elliott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: It's a cool experience for me and my son\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruslan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Menakhi K Henu Jay\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: The main thing that matters is that my boy had a great time.

They are very intrusive and want to collect all of your personal information. Who knows where they are selling it.\n2. They charge for grandparents & handicap people who are not there to play. They force elderly and handicap people to buy socks and tickets when they just want to sit and watch their grandkids play.\n3. OVER priced for the small space kids have to play. The kids get bored with such limited things to do.\n\nNo 👎🏻 thanks. They will be out of business soon.\n\nGo to a trampoline park. It's a much better value and kids will have more to do. Plus you won't get knocked over the head with charges just to watch your own kids....\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Calderon\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I had heard so much about this place and was excited to take my granddaughter.  I won’t go again.\nIt is obviously not well maintained at all.  Dirty, and SO many games broken but not marked as such.  Dropped a lot of coins that got us nothing.  Adult pricing seems excessive and to have to buy their socks - though I was sitting at a table the whole time seemed foolish.\nTheir listing should boldly state their shoes/ socks policy.\nTheir house keeping needs a royal step up and their employees need to learn some manners.  Disappointing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Nicholson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Nice\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Crysta Leena Patricio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vira Vorobiova\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tom Van Steenkiste\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Second adult per kid you have to pay for is kind of a bummer but other than that a really nice place.

Admission is reasonable. Cashier in the front didn’t give us wrist bands so that made leaving confusing. Food was pricey but decent, took almost an hour before we got our food and partially due to them not properly putting phone number in for text notification. Kids had a lot of fun though. I feel like there should be staff walking through checking on kids cause it is a big area and to try to keep balls in their areas as it is a tripping hazard. This area is so big you can lose a kiddo and if they don’t actually check wristbands/neglect to give them then I feel this could be a major safety hazard. I do like that you have unlimited play time though unlike other places we have gone to.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucy Deng\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have so much fun in here！\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kailani Benavides\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: everything is good but the pizza is very expensive and bad\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Guenther\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Great place and your kids will love it.

Came here with my son my sister and nephew on Memorial Day the man that checked us in gave me a really hard time because we wanted to pay separately instead of together to avoid the additional $7.95 charge for an adult. He made me put my son’s water cup in the dirty shoe bin because water was “not allowed.” Upon entering I noticed water canteens on almost every table so I went back and brought this to his attention where he then gave me my son’s water cup back. Very strange. I’m 7 months pregnant and wanted to take my son to do something fun and in turn I come here just to feel super stressed out and uncomfortable by a grumpy employee. Super disappointing. Bathrooms are completely disgusting as well, brown on the walls in the stall. So it seems that the staff was concerned with my son’s water bottle than anything else! There’s a Wally Wombats not far from this place, way cleaner and friendly customer service.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Lopez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I can’t comment on their playground because I didn’t get inside. My issue was with their policy on charging adults. I arrived with friends, each accompanied by their own child. When we were asked if we came together, I said yes and offered to pay for everyone, expecting my friends to reimburse me later. Despite each adult having their own child and us all signing waivers, they insisted on charging me for four adults simply because we arrived as a group. I questioned why we had to pay extra when they weren’t providing any additional care for our kids. They replied it was their policy for group arrivals. Frustrated, I requested a refund and went to Kangamoo at Sunset instead.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anny Smyth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nima Lhaden\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sophia Marielle\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: employees gave so much attitude i didn't like their energy\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Breen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I would like to express my appreciation for the professional and courteous service provided by the front desk staff, particularly the young man who was also observed diligently vacuuming the kitchen.

The place is large with a good layout.\n\nThe negatives - The posted food menu did not match what the cashier was ringing up and she could not change it to match without being up charged.  Waited 45 minutes for a quesadilla and chicken sandwich.  The bathroom was disgusting and we arrived near opening so it was not restocked from the night before or cleaned.  Leaking toilets while wearing socks, there are sandals but no sign if for public use so was unsure who's they were.  The machines for the kids to use in the play area were broken or lacking power to where the balls would not shoot out or power up.  The games seemed expensive, $1 for 2 tokens.\n\nOverall I'd say it was ok.  If they maintained the broken items and cleaned better it would be a five star.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: USN MAA\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is a terrible place.

It's a very large play place, and sometimes, when it's too busy, the little ones get hurt/run over by older kids. All the kids, for the most part, appeared to be under 6 when I was there.  The jungle gym is big enough that a parent is able to climb through it as well. Seemed pretty clean, didn't go to the restrooms which I hate because you're in socks only. They have some arcade games, but after spending $18 to get in, it can get expensive playing games. The birthday space I wasn't impressed with simply because it's all linked together in one large room.  Just rows of tables, maybe 10 - 15, so you don't have a personal space. You're behind glass separated from the general public, but not from anyone else having a birthday party at the same time. There's plenty of seating available for parents while the kids play, and the snack bar has a nice variety of items. Pricing wise they're high, but it's a play place so I expected it. It was almost $7 for a small slurpee (6 or 8oz I believe) and bottle of water.  The air guns in the playpen weren't working and there are several of them. Looked like no one had checked them to see because balls were stuck in them that weren't intended for the guns. I wasn't able to pull them out, and even guns that had nothing stuck in them weren't working either. Overall, my daughter enjoyed herself so I'd definitely go back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mariah Zaste\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids always have a blast the food is mid but the kids love it and I love the massaging chairs\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Banks\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Used to love this place years ago...it's went downhill since...not the cleanest at all.

Great customer service!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julianne Doty\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 days ago\nReview: The facility itself is super nice and our kids had a great time- my issue was with the staff. Parents bring their young kids to these places and are paying for a pleasant experience and outing. Right when we walked in my 3 year old son saw a shark he wanted, so at the end of our trip we went to the arcade to try to win tickets. He was closing in on nap time, so we went to the front to get the shark toy, and we were 30 tickets short. He had a full on meltdown and i asked the staff lady if i could just pay the difference and she told me to go back in to win 30 more tickets. With two toddlers this is sort of unreasonable so i asked again if i can just pay for it as he was almost to the point of vomiting in the entry of the building. She just watched as he freaked out over this shark and literally no staff said anything just sorry we can’t do anything. Any normal business catering to2-3 year old children would know kids may want a toy at the end and have waived the 30 ticket difference or just allowed me to buy the $2 shark for my son. It made a fun experience an awful one for myself and my toddler. Know your audience people.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diana Suarez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 days ago\nReview: Great place for kids!

It's a little pricey when it comes to birthdays but that's because they do the whole decoration. They do a digital background for your daughter or your son. That also comes with pizza drinks\nif you go to different places and check those prices it's about the same or less here . My daughter is scared of chuck e cheese. So we come here now! As long as my daughter isn't scared, that's all that matters to me. Their food is actually pretty good.They just got those bougie cakes.I've been seeing everybody buy. They just installed a new arcade as well. It's great They have a few different games for the littles to play on . It's one of those little cars with the camera so you can ride along and get your picture taken while having a blast. they also have a picture booth in the building .. the lady that does the party planning is so awesome. When nobody came for my son's birthday, she had Wally come out for free and take pictures with the kids! When we had my daughter's birthday there, it was a blast Everybody showed up and they still gave us a card for a free visit but come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Warren Laque\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: My grandson loves this place always makes a lot of friends and has so much fun very friendly staff very clean a place I can relax in air-conditioned comfort and feel he's always safe\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Perez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Mall ring location is the best out of the two locations in Las Vegas.

It’s so nice having a place where she can grow and explore her blossoming physical abilities! Both locations are great and the front desk staff has always been super sweet and helpful! We also love that we can leave and come! Parents concerned about older kids being around their littles, try taking your littles to the toddler time from 9-12 Monday to Friday!

Indoor playground was spacious and had many things to do for my two year old son. Would definitely go again, and would probably host a birthday party there.\n\nWhat's inside?\n- Huge ball-pit area + interactive projected screen\n- Playground/jungle gym thing with swings, a large slide, obstacle courses, and guns that actually shoot the balls (unlike Uptown Jungle where the guns did not work)\n- Party Rooms; decently sized and much colder compared to main area, and could fit around 20 people.\n- Food area (didn't order myself but the party had pizzas, fries and drinks)\n- Arcade area; I didn't personally check it out but it looked like a decent size.\n\nMy only \"complaint\" is that it was a bit warm in there, but I understand as it was a large space and must be difficult to keep cool. Also the restrooms could have been cleaner.\n\nStaff was kind, had no issues.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angel Taylor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My son (age 2) and I had a great time!!!

If you have a baby or toddler, I highly recommend bringing them when the older kids are at school so they don’t get accidentally run over in all the excitement.  The facility is clean and well managed so even my VERY particular husband was impressed (he didn’t want me bringing the baby here at first).  I love the quiet room off to the side so I could give baby a break and nurse when needed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joeann Brown\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It’s overly crowded and they have the audacity to raise the price.

We came early in the morning on a school day so there were no problem of \"big kids.\"  They loved going up and and down the giant and small slide.  My little one liked the swings and merry go around.  My 3 year old liked hitting the screen by the ball pit with the balls for their video game activity.  It tired her out.  The space was really fun for an hour or two but then it does get a little repetitive.\n\nThis is a fun place to visit when the weather doesn't allow for outside play and kids need to get out.  But weekday mornings are probably best.\n\nThe service was lacking.  I was trying to find the Aldi nearby and asked the staff there and they told me how to get there but failed to tell me that it wasn't open yet.  So I took my 2 kids all the way over to Aldi's only to find out that they're still under renovation.  That was a fun walk for everyone after two hours running around at Wally Wombat's.  A little heads up like, \"hey last we heard it wasn't open yet.\" would have been awesome.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sheridan Jackson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My granddaughters had a terrific time.

They have a comfortable seating area with vending machines & massage chairs for parents. They have a large party room, that's great for birthdays and the staff was cleaning throughout the party to keep the area clean.\n\nCons- lots of broken games. Most games don't have \"out of order signs\" over the token slots so, kiddos are frustrated with machines. Some machines that \"work\" are missing buttons so you can't select different options. The token machine was out of order in the back with a broken foosball table.... making it confusing where to get tokens (At the front desk)?  The little swing sets have twine rope holding the swings together, I don't think it's sturdy enough for play (an accident waiting to happen).\n\nOverall it's okay, but it's not Wally Wombats.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sari Dan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Very clean and perfect size for toddlers.

I always used to come here… But not anymore.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janice “Jan” Hartmann\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Coming here was our grandson's choice, as he had been here once with his mom. The name has changed since then, to the current name , \"Kid's Topia.\"\n\nAt first look, he was happily entertained, but after viewing so many broken toys and arcade games that we had spent money on, with no refunds, I can't recommend this place outside of a safe area for 5 and under to play.\n\nThe arcade games that work, I'd say, are geared for 6 and up, some older.  I guess they're trying to appeal to families with older and younger kids, to inculde them all.\n\nThe attendent was kind and kept on top of keeping the area sanitized and toys organized.\n\nLastly, the bathrooms were clean and brightly colored with fresh painted colors and equipment.\n\nThey have a nice couch sitting area for adults and snacks or lunches to bring in. Towels or something to clean the tables would be appreciated.\n\nMy three star rating was for safety and cleanliness, with two stars removed for broken arcades and equipment, with the no refund policy on tokens. My husband reminded me that it was about our grandson's enjoyment and that he had fun with another little boy he played with, so it was worth it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daryl Pritchard\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Came to visit with my family, the owner os very rude and kicked my entire family out due to a schedule\nError on their part.

From the moment we stepped through the doors, we were greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that immediately put us at ease.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Kids Topia is the wonderful experience it offers for children. The facility is thoughtfully designed with a variety of engaging and stimulating activities that cater to children of all ages. From colorful play structures to imaginative play areas, there was something for every child to enjoy.\n\nThe staff at Kids Topia are truly exceptional. They are not only friendly and approachable but also highly professional and attentive to the needs of the children.\n\nSpeaking of safety, I was impressed by the security measures in place at Kids Topia. The facility is always locked, providing an added layer of security for peace of mind. Additionally, the cleanliness standards are impeccable, with a strict shoes-off policy that helps to maintain a hygienic environment for children to play in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Clean place.

Being in his presence is unpleasant. You get a sense of...wrongness from him.\n\nThat's separate and apart from the fact that he's still wearing a mask in 2023.\n\nHand sanitizer is mandatory at this place. They're going to squirt some of that poison on your kids' hands whether you like it or not.\n\nI found out before they tried. Before I even paid, actually.\n\nThat's good. If I'd paid and had to leave, I wouldn't have liked that result. If they'd tried to pump that poison onto my kids' hands, they wouldn't have liked the result.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kevin Ersoy\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: They have some fun stuff for kids, but it's not helpful to have half the place full of non included arcade games.

CLEAN , Open with tons of variety of toys. My son is 17 months and there was plenty for him to do as well as toys for older children. The basketball hoop entertained my husband as well, while I played with our son 😂 friendly staff, price is about the same as other indoor play grounds however this one has all day play! You can step out and grab lunch then come right back and enjoy more play time , no extra cost . Definitely worth the drive for me as I don’t live close to this one. Will be back for sure\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ameli Аmeli\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I came here with my 4year old daughter, but I also had a 9month baby with me.

I said that I would look after my eldest daughter, and he would be in a stroller at 9 months old  and will not play, this playground is not suitable for his age. They insisted that we buy socks from them for the baby, I did not agree.and we stayed on the street with the baby and they didn’t let us in, I will never bring my daughter here again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: at at\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: MARIBEL CASTILLO\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yvonne Kai Anderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We always have tons of fun at Kids Planet!

There was a lot of really big kids and the place is really small so crashing into the little ones and being bullies of course, i didn’t like that. It’s not as clean as other places  I’ve visited either. It smelled like feet so much, and it was extremely loud. For being on that side of town it was really ghetto.\nThe other place we usually go to was closed so it is what it is.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley lynn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My 2 year old absolute love it so much to do for her\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Krystian Chraczynski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Clean and the staff is very friendly.

It doesn't look like a lot compared to other indoor playgrounds, but that didn't stop them from running around non stop for almost three hours. One of the gentlemen there had a small drone that he flew around for the girls to chase. That was great! There are cute, unusual arcade games for older kids. We'll definitely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: van Teme\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Moore-Dowd\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: pritika chaudary\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashneel Prasad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: Awsome place.

Has many eye catching activities. Never boring. The gentlemen working there was very attentive to his job and even engaged with the kids which was very rare to see. Just the right amount too. Not to mention he was very sweet and to the point with our first introduction to the place. There was a moment when I thought one of the arcade games wasnt working but it's just that it was very quiet, still, he gave me another coin to start over. I go to many different indoor playgrounds and this one makes the mark. Not to mention the pass is all day?! Yeah. Def amazing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Wolbert\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: This place is for young toddlers. To let them run around and be wild.

Right after that we went to the playground I took my 2 old daughter there the thing I didn't like was that my daughter got hit about 4 times there where kids there none of there parents where looking at them.  The other area where there suppose to be 3 years and younger there was older kids therethat was over 3 years old which these kids where rough. I thinks parents should looking at there kids at all times. There was some staff walking around and they didn't say anything about the older kids that where in the 3 and under section where the balls are at and slide. Im just saying to the family's that go there I found out that in the morning its better to take your toddler instead in the afternoon. In the morning they have a toddler only from a certain time. I think the staff should be more responsible what they see if thr company is enforcing the rules. Going back there again yes I would go but only in the morning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Triple Threat\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 hours ago\nReview: Awesome place the girls love it here!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Wendt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: Very fun for my toddler and cheap prices during the day when it's a little bit less chaotic.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danit Rubanoff\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 days ago\nReview: We love this place, it’s always so clean and staff is friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jenni.M01\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cyrena Davidson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan Lopez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a week ago\nReview: Friendly staff, always have a great experience.

Definitely come back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam Villanueva\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Wally Wombats is hands down one of the most delightful and family-friendly indoor playgrounds I’ve ever visited. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that feels like a breath of fresh air for parents and an absolute wonderland for kids. The space is immaculately clean, thoughtfully designed, and bursting with creative energy—it's clear the team behind Wally Wombats truly cares about making every visit a memorable experience.\n\nThe play structures are incredible—colorful, safe, and engaging for a wide range of ages. My kids could have stayed for hours exploring the climbing walls, tunnels, and slides, while the soft play areas are perfect for little ones who are just learning to crawl and walk. I especially appreciate the attention to safety: the staff keeps a watchful eye on the play zones, and everything from the flooring to the equipment feels high-quality and well-maintained.\n\nWhat really sets Wally Wombats apart, though, is the heart behind it. The staff is exceptional—kind, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about creating a positive environment. They go above and beyond to ensure families feel welcome and supported, whether it’s helping with a birthday party setup or offering a friendly smile when you need a coffee break. Speaking of which, the café area is a fantastic touch! It’s a cozy space where parents can relax while the kids play, and the menu has plenty of options that make it easy to refuel without leaving the building.\n\nWally Wombats is also an incredible spot for hosting parties and special events. Their team takes care of the details so you can actually enjoy the day with your family, and they make every celebration feel special and unique.\n\nWhether you're looking for a safe, engaging place for your kids to burn off energy or a welcoming community space for families to connect, Wally Wombats delivers in every way. It’s a gem in the community, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. If you’re in the area, do yourself and your family a favor—come experience the magic of Wally Wombats!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yon Mongcal\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The place is actually fun for kids looking clean. The only problem is that the noise which K don’t know where is it coming from and it terrifies my boy ( May not affect other kids ). But the place is actually good for the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matisla\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Went for the first time on a Sunday at 10 AM, so glad we got there early because it wasn’t crowded yet. Everything looked clean and I saw a staff member regularly spraying down the equipment, which was nice. My 4 year old had so much fun running around!\n\nOnly downside was they didn’t let us use the bikes. The staff said it was too crowded but honestly, it didn’t feel that way. We didn’t try the food or drinks so can’t comment on that. Overall, a fun spot- we’ll probably be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: N M (Redfeline)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5-star rating!

That upsets me because the guy knew that. Why aren't employees  taking pride in their work.\nIf they wouldn't eat it like that, why would they have someone else to do so.\n\nOther than that it's ok..minor adjustments should be considered.\n\nAlso not being able to bring your food in is a game changer especially little snacks for babies.\nBut I can deal with that!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sheree Dickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Our son always has a blast here!!

They stopped with therapy then turned it into an arcade. The staff here is rude at times. It seems like it lost the purpose of what wally wombat used to be. A place where kids were respected and valued and mostly cared for. This is just a dark dimmed playground now. My kids like the indoor playground because this is where they started their therapies. It became like a second home. Now the price to even play has gone up so much and also most of the staff just has an icky face towards childre. Like why even hire people like that. Another issue, it happens a lot ... when trying to get our bucket up front our profile 'doesn't show up\" so I have to go and re do the waiver again and again. It saddens me how this place was so amazing for kids is rotten bit by bit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christian Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Thank you Christian for your 5-star rating!

I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oshun 4U\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 days ago\nReview: Very clean, staff were friendly and helpful.

Also, their facility is extremely clean, and so big and safe, it makes throwing birthdays and spending evenings or weekends here pretty magical for our kids😍😍\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lesly Pordes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We had our 3 year oldest birthday party at Kidstopia and we loved it. The place is very clean and has trampolines, swings, big wheels, slides, and other games for kids. There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linda Hang\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: If I can do no stars I would! They need to do better with their appointment dates! I booked an open play a month ago! A month! For Thanksgiving day. Nowhere on the website or when booking the open play says they will be closed for the holiday. The holiday wasn't blacked out either. So I THOUGHT they were going to be open since not everywhere is closed.

We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.\nMy daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.\n\nOtherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shirley Furlong-Lim\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This place is clean and organized. The owner is very nice and friendly.

Positives: nice staff, clean bathrooms, not too busy. Negatives: you have to pay extra to use the arcade games and many of them didn't even work or were missing buttons. The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Princess Tolentino\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I rented this place for my daughter’s 1st bday. I have to say this place is very clean and spacious especially the party room. I love how the place offers areas for little to big kids. The arcade was a hit for the older kids. The staff was very friendly and very attentive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris We\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dana Telfer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We had the best time at Kidstopia for my son's third birthday! We booked last minute bc of the extreme heat warnings, and they made everything so easy and fun! We will definitely be returning to take advantage of the clean, air conditioned facilities!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evelyn De Jesus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I was hired to face paint at a party here and I must say I was impressed! You will have to take your shoes off, which I think is great. The party room is so large. The kids really looked like they were having a blast! I plan to return with my grandson. Only negative is the parking lot is a bit small. Owners seemed very friendly too. Great place!!! 👍🏽👍🏽\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anthony Proano\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! The kids loved it! The owner, Loucas, and his team really went above and beyond. They take care of you and make sure the party is a good time. We will be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yenisey Ramirez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place to host a birthday party.

SUZY at the gift desk was very approachable and sweet. Good vibes. Good Energy. Good Music.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Ka’awa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Recently had my son’s 3rd birthday party here and it was such a great time! We did the semi-private weekend party package and had about 50 people in our party alone but it was nice to also share the venue with the public. The party room is huge and has a private bathroom for your guests.\nThe party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here. Not to mention Lucas (owner) and his staff are very friendly and easy to work with\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sonji\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charisse Najarro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was a success. The place was clean and the staff and owner were very nice and easy to deal with. I would recommend this place for your kid’s parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittney Moore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had the best experience having our daughter’s 4th birthday party here this past Saturday!! Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Phillip Busche\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday there, was great.

The owner Loucas and his employees are so friendly and so hospitable. Our daughter’s birthday party was a success. There was even ample room to have Pose Party Post set up a braid bar for the girls. The kids had so much fun and could not get enough of the claw machine there. The parents that came were able sit back and relax knowing their kids were in sight and safe.\nThey set up the party room too which is such a huge help! Overall, just a nice establishment to be able to support.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louie S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a really lovely indoor playground.

Party room is big and spacious and beautifully decorated and again spotless. I am really impressed with Kidstopja and highly recommend it to children of all ages.

A wonderful, clean, indor environment for them to play and make new friends. Yes, they're temporarily closed and going through a transition period with new management coming in June, but I'm sure it will continue to be a fun place for the kids to play and socialize.

We've been here a few times with out homeschool friends and the kids play for hours. I'm getting ready to buy the membership so I can work in one of the rooms they have while the kids play. We can bring our own food and eat there so we always bring a lunch. It's def worth checking out. Super clean too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dawn Diaz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: We couldn’t have asked for a better venue for our little princess first birthday.

Thank you so much😊 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Green\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: VIP Family Indoor Play and More is a gem for both kids and parents! My kids love it, and honestly, I do too. Friends and family have given it a solid 10/10, and my out-of-state relatives always ask to visit when they’re in town. The events are top-tier, and the owners are incredibly kind, generous, and welcoming. The space is spotless, fun for the kids, and surprisingly relaxing for parents. It’s also a perfect co-working spot—bring your laptop, and you’ll be set!\n\nThe best part? There are no blind spots, so I can always keep an eye on my kiddos without worry. They even allow outside food and drinks, which is a game-changer. Everything you need to know about events and open play is super clear on their website and flyers, so you’ll always know what to expect. Definitely recommend this place to any parent!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Promise Strong\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Had my daughters bday there privately closed off the whole place for us as we enjoyed karaoke & video games she also made custom decorations which was Bambi my daughter loved plus provided unlimited drinks all we had to worry bout was food. I also went there a few times just for my kids to play 10/10 recommend I always try to look for indoor places for my kids this is the most convenient & secure place to me where you can bring your own food & it has things for all ages here. As well as jus my kids havin fun Witout me havin to run around & worry about where they’re at all the time becuhz it’s very spacious but not big enough to lose your children you can relax & watch them attentively no problems. They also do events & activities frequently it’s fantastic I love this place getting my monthly membership soon!!! Really one of the places that’s actually worth getting a membership too\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sandee Van Epps\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: This is a really fun place for kids 0-13.  They have karaoke rooms, and videogames. There are so many toys and a cute play area. There are security measures to avoid little kids getting out by themselves. The owner is super nice and helpful, and so is the staff.  The whole area is super clean. And the best part is that they have enclosed areas for the very small kiddos, where they can stay safe from older kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Itati's World\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Such a great place to let your kids play. With this extreme heat, it helps so much to go to an indoor place that’s not packed of older kids. I love that it’s smaller, so you won’t loose your kid lol\nThe staff was super sweet and it was super clean.\nDefinitely coming back again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joann Stoll\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Nice space for small babies and toddlers.

I am very lucky that i found this place on google and fell in love right away upon seeing the video on their website hearing their vision and the commitment they want to provide for their guests was spectacular and upto the day of the event they really treated us like VIP and made sure we are having fun!\n\nThe owner is very responsive thru instagram and calls for all the my questions and concerns and that is a plus, this place suites for everyone all ages. I was overwhelmed with how they prepared the place for us, every dollar i paid for was worth it. They have a very friendly staffs and Jasmine the owner really went an extra mile, she is super sweet and very communicative, she’s so wonderful making us feel like a real VIP while having fun at the VIP Family. Everyone wasn’t left out everybody has something to do.\n\nWe all had fun and when we went home I realized that I didn’t even have pictures with everyone because we were out there having so much fun. I only have few photos but the memories we created out there will be treasured!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kirill Byelin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place! Kids had a blast! It has a different vibe from most play places we’ve been to. Kinda feels like you’re at someone’s house birthday party who has a bunch of fun toys and games to play. My 9 y.o. Boy love the video game tournament. And 7 y.o. Daughter loved running around playing with other kids. The owners were very cool and seemed to enjoy what they do. We’ll definitely be back. (Sorry, had so much fun that we forgot to take a pic until we already left)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kasia Kassie “kassie” Christy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had my daughters teen karokie birthday party at ViP Kids and loved it!

Great place to take children or family activities.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Donovan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just went to check this place out with my friend and our kids. We stayed for THREE HOURS because our kids were having so much fun, and we got a chance to actually sit and talk while being able to keep our kids occupied and have a safe eye on them.\n100% worth a visit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yuval Zookin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our family has found sheer joy and excitement here every time we visit. It's become our favorite spot for our little one's adventures. From the moment we walk in, the vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff make us feel right at home.\n\nThe impressive array of toys available keeps our little explorer engaged for hours on endplay and when she's old enough the structure im sure will be a hit too, offering a perfect blend of exploration and play.\n\nOne thing that caught our eye is the private-party rooms. They exude warmth and charm, and we can't wait to host a special celebration there. The attention to detail is remarkable, ensuring every event is unforgettable.\n\nEven though we haven't experienced one of their private events yet, we're eagerly anticipating it. The thought of celebrating amidst such a lively and welcoming atmosphere is incredibly enticing.\n\nIn summary, if you're seeking an indoor playground that ticks all the boxes for kids and parents alike, look no further than VIPKids Indoor Play & More - It's a haven where laughter fills the air, friendships are formed, and memories are made.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diana Contreras\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: VIPKids lives up to its name.  The moment you walk in, the staff greets you warmly and is really attentive throughout. Not only does our family enjoy the daily play but also birthday parties and special events hosted by VIPkids, which are now our favorite! My toddler has a blast running around in the safety of the play area while we enjoy karaoke and game consoles in their upscale party rooms that look out to the play area. They have designated play pens for babies that give me peace of mind.\n\nThe owners are fun, engaging, and truly passionate about catering to everyone’s unique events, letting you get as creative as you’d like and making you feel like family. For events, they are with you every step of the planning process - from amazing balloon arches to piñatas, and personalized center pieces they help bring your vision to life. 10/10 would recommend for all ages and family events!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jose Menjoulou Perini\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is amazing, the staff is super nice, kind and helpful. They have so many options for kids to have fun and entertain themself. My favorite part of this place is that not only kids have fun but also the adults. Every time I go there  I love to karaoke or play video games. Also I love that every month they have special events with diferente themes. If you are looking for a clean and fun place to spend the day with your family or friends I totally recommend VIP Kids Indor Play & More.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carolina Díaz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: VIP kids is a great place!! I love the concept it offers because there are activities for kids of all ages. My favorite part is the rooms with karaoke with all the wigs and also the video games. I also love it because they offer the option to bring in your own food for parties. The owners are nice, professional and  very accomodating. I highly recommend everyone to visit VIP Kids, it's a super fun place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blake1720\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: There’s good and bad about this place. The reason I rated it three stars is due to the price being so high for an indoor playground verses what you get. 18.50 for one kid. The siblings is 16.50. It amounted to 36 something. The pass is for the entire day, but since it’s only the size of an office space I think it’s a stretch for the average family to stay more than a few hours. (My kids 3 & 5 wanted to finish up within 1 hour.) It’s a small, family owned playground (owner was very nice and gave a lollipop to each kid.)\non the way out) I’ve been to almost all the indoor playgrounds in Vegas, some very well put together that charge less. They have motorized cars that are basically useless since they do not have the battery and cannot be driven. My kids were asking multiple times to get them to work, which I of course couldn’t. I don’t see the point of having two enticing cars that cannot drive in that space. The basketball area was a great addition that my boys enjoyed. The bathrooms weren’t super cleanly. Out of two bathrooms one of the doors lock didn’t work. It would probably benefit the business to have another employee on hand to tidy the space a bit. The actual play set is fairly small. They did have comfy couches and lots of floor toys. Ultimately, If the price was more reasonable I wouldn’t be as harsh. I feel other play places you pay less for more. I wish the owner well though and hope they can grow their business over time.\n- [ ]\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kylee Crowther\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is where it’s at!!!! My kids absolutely love coming to play. Not only do they have a fun place for kids, but they also have so many different events for families and all ages. They really cater to the public and make you feel like a VIP.  The customer service is also fantastic. If you’re looking to have a birthday party, or any other event, they make it happen exactly how you want it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashton Baez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: An absolute gem! VIP kids offers a diverse range of activities for all ages, including indoor play ground, board games, toys, air hockey, basketball, karaoke and video games. Impeccably clean and staffed with friendly faces, it's a haven for families. Kids enjoyed the playground and the activities, while the rest of the family rocked out to karaoke and battled it out on video games. A perfect blend of fun and entertainment for everyone!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diego Barraza\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place highly recommend this location\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ariane Barrera\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We went to VIPKids for my daughter’s birthday party.

The owners are so kind and accommodating and they can help you with anything that you need, even the clean up! I highly recommend VIP Kids for birthday parties, karaoke parties, adult parties, and video games!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: From the moment we stepped into VIP Kids Indoor Play & More, Jasmine, the owner, welcomed us with such warmth and enthusiasm that we instantly felt like part of the VIP family. Her dedication to creating a vibrant and engaging environment for children is evident in every corner of the meticulously maintained facility, filled with a variety of fun and educational activities designed for kids of all ages. Jasmine's passion doesn't stop at the decor; she is actively involved in every event, ensuring each child and parent has a memorable experience.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was the costume party, a testament to Jasmine's commitment to providing extraordinary family experiences. She was there, engaging with parents and children alike, orchestrating games, handing out prizes, and even joining in the fun, which added a personal touch that made the event even more special. Seeing Jasmine interact with families, including my children and myself, highlighted how much she cares about fostering a community where children can safely play, learn, and grow.\n\nWhat truly sets VIP Kids apart, under Jasmine's stewardship, is the sense of community and joy it fosters among families. Jasmine's attentive, friendly approach and her genuine passion for enriching children's lives shine through, making every visit feel personal and unique. The three hours of gameplay, laughter, and bonding flew by, leaving us all eagerly anticipating our next visit.\n\nIn conclusion, VIP Kids Indoor Play & More, under Jasmine's loving guidance, is more than just an indoor play center; it's a haven of happiness and growth for families. Her welcoming presence, along with the center's fantastic offerings, ensures that every family leaves with cherished memories and a longing to return. For anyone looking for an exceptional play experience that feels like home, VIP Kids, thanks to Jasmine, is the ultimate destination.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristin Huth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Super cute play room with everything ur kid would want to play with. Kids didn’t want to leave\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Page\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We celebrated my son turning 4 at VIP Kids. While the place was fine and the kids had fun, the customer service was non existent. We paid for a two hour party (2:30-4:30), but the employee was telling me 40 minutes before the party ended that I had to be out by 4:30. So I had to stop hosting to start packing everything up… before my event ever ended?\n\nWe have done an indoor playground for 3 birthday parties now and this was by far the worst experience we’ve had. The employees offered no assistance and rushed us out while having the next party people waiting in the lobby before our party ended.\nLastly, when booked they said that we would pay the deposit at that time and pay the remainder at the end of the party. Upon arrival they required payment before the party started.\nOverall not a great experience and would not do a party there again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Burns\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: This place does definitely not resemble their name. They do NOT make you feel like a VIP.  Management needs a lesson in customer service. This is not a good place to spend your money.  That is all they care about. It’s basically one small room with a very small place area. I saw no video games. They are so small that if they have a private party that is all they can accommodate. They will ask u to leave. They are closed on Sunday which is crazy! They require everyone, including handicapped adults” to remove shoes and have soaks on. Even to sit on the couch. If u challenge them on anything they are rude to u. There are much nicer kid play areas in Las Vegas than this one to spend your money at. This place will not make it long. I have more toys in my back yard than they have at this place.\n\nAfter reading the owner or managers response to my review. I’m editing my message. I would actually love for them to post the video of me going in there. Because that is not how things transpired.   When I walk in I ask about the hours and the cost to play. The girls at the front tell me That they are having a private party in 20 minutes and will be closing to the public. She said I should have called, but that I could fill out there forms and have a tour and a look around to check things out.\nI also mentioned that I would’ve called if my comment on her post had been responded to. Because It wasn’t I couldn’t find the post so I didnt remember the name or address. I proceeded to drive around the area trying to find it. I did not know their phone number or their name and I was looking for the original post so that I could call.\nYes, I was with the teenager and a one-year-old. They are my grandchildren. Yes, my one-year-old sat on toy car while I was reading their pricelist , took their tour which last about 3 minutes because it’s one tiny room,  I then took an important phone call. While i let my granddaughter , whom we had removed her shoes as requested so she could see if she was going to like it there , go check out the toys. Then I was Approached and asked to leave. I had been there maybe five minutes !!! Them saying I let my grandbaby play there is a stretch. She sat on a little toy car !! I was trying to see this was going to be something she would like to do. When I told the girl, I thought you said we had 20 minutes  She said , yeah we have to clean for the party. I was more than willing to pay for 20 minutes. Mind you. But they didn’t give me a price for that!!\nI said ok fine. And we got ready to leave! She said I Stormed off? I walked out the door!! Yes that’s true My 16 year old grandson was getting his sister and putting her shoes on. That is because I am handicapped and I can  not lift her! how is it storming off???\nI am in so many parenting groups that I will tell every single one of them not to take their kids there. I have never ever ever been treated so rudely in my life. I have worked in customer care for 35 years!  none of my friends are going to be interested in taking their kid to a place where if they have one party, they cannot accommodate anybody else.  It is literally one room with two little side closets. One where they sit down and have pizza and one where they have a little karaoke. There’s nothing there for teenagers. My teenager grandson said that he would not want to stay there at all ever for anything. And like I said, I have more toys in my backyard than they had in that place. not to mention you do not speak to potential customers like that.  Just how much do you think I should’ve paid for my grandbaby to sit in a toy car for a minute?  I truly am curious how u treat children if this is how u treat their parents . Your business will be gone in a year. Unless it’s a money laundering business. .\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Francis Adam Sinsuat\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place rocks! We really love the space and how you can sit anywhere and relax and not have to worry about where your kids are especially if you have toddlers.

Keep it up!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Liset Alvarado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love VIP KIDS.

Def a hidden gem!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elias Sanchez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I brought my three kids here ranging from ages 9 to 2 years old and I was impressed with the cleanliness and variety of things to do for all ages! my 9 year old went straight to the video games and my 7 year old started playing with the variety of toys that were there and my 2 year old went to the playground. That was the first time I was able to set up my laptop and get some work done while all three kids were entertained. I highly recommend this place to every parent! The staff was very welcoming and friendly and I appreciated that they took the safety and rules seriously because I have been to indoor kid's playgrounds where it was a mad house. Awesome place and I will be reaching out to get my Daughter's party planned there as well!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gabriela Sanchez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Love this place ! It’s very intimate and quiet for kids and adults . None of that screaming or crying that you hear at most indoor places . I work a lot and I love bringing my 2 year old here to socialize while I get some work done on my laptop . I also enjoy their tables where I can pack a snack to enjoy with my little guy . And they sell all the snacks he loves !!! Such a great idea thank you for opening in the northwest .\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: russell henriquez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a great experience at VIP Kids.

Everything is very clean and the party/karaoke  rooms are cute and modern. The owners are awesome and are willing to accommodate how you want the place set up for the private bookings. Pricing is fair with a huge variety of things you can add on if you wish (even a Photo Booth!) Also they let you bring in your own food and drinks so you aren't limited in what you can serve. It was great having a party at place that was safe enough for the little kids to roam wild and free but still had a cute vibe and things to entertain the bigger kids and adults. Definitely recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bo Heaton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son loves VIP kids. Because of that, we decided to do his 3rd birthday party there, construction themed. We chose the package where decorations, tableclothes, plates/utensils, and drinks were included. We felt that the price was very fair for what we got. The kids loved the play area, the video games and karaoke. There is plenty of tables and comfy couches for the adults to be comfortable and socialize. The owner is very accommodating and texted often with updates. We appreciate the personal touch of the decorations. I recommend VIP kids for single day passes and birthday parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Davies\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is awesome! Highly recommend!!

It was small and the color scheme and activities more centered for girls. I brought my 3 almost 4 year old son here and although he had have fun he seemed to have lost interest after 30-45 minutes. He said it was for little babies and I would agree this place is better for 1- just turning 3 year olds. $16 for all day but we aren’t at the mall for that long and we don’t usually end up going back so the price is a little high.

We mostly like to play outside in the summers but we love that they have a trampoline we can use and lots of things to climb on. It keeps my kids entertained and they love it here. I've been here a few times and I actively watch them and follow them to make sure they are safe and I personally think it is gross. Staff are teenagers that aren't very friendly and play on their phones the entire time. The 3 times I've been there I saw someone \"clean\" once. The girl just sprayed benches people weren't sitting on without wiping them down which isn't really cleaning. I also never personally saw them clean the playground. I don't know what their cleaning expectations are but I've been to other indoor playgrounds before I moved here that had employees go into the play area every hour with spray and cloths to wipe down the equipment and it always smelled clean. We will go here again most likely but I wish their staff would actually work and make the place a clean and friendly atmosphere like I'm sure the owners expect them and pay them to do.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maria Granados\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica K Smith\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Nice and well sized indoor playground for kids. The kids played for about an hour and a half before they were ready to go. We've been twice and both times other kids closed off parts of the playground and wouldn't let other kids in or stole all of the balls etc., talking to other parents, the kids, staff etc isn't really worth it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Knight\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Adam Morfin\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Overall the place was just ok. The ball pit was non functional, no ball cannons,  which was a bigger play area kinda outta commission. Also there are balloons stuck on the ceiling that have either popped or deflated long ago and just for looks should be cleaned up. The play areas did seem fairly clean but some maintenance could be done. While it didn't feel unsafe it felt very worn.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madison Dilts\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: This was very fun to take the kids I nanny to!

Great for year around fun and kid Birthday parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joshua Garner\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My kids loved this place. There is lots for them to do here. My kids are ages 6-11, and they are the perfect age for this place. It might be a bit much if your kids are younger than that. Especially if you go on a busy day like spring break. If you take your toddler age kids, it's pretty likely you will find yourself climbing up the big toy to save your lost and scared kid 😂.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is the layout. I was there on a busy day, and all the seating for the parents at the front were full, so we had to sit on the side in the back. Which made it hard to watch for our kids, this resulted in one of my friends kids going outside in a panic looking for him. 🤦🏼‍♂️ We had no idea until some other mom there found him and brought him back in and helped him find us. After that we just had to stand up in the front till some seating cleared up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nick B\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited 3 months ago\nReview: Fun place for the kids to play. $10.50 each or $8 for an $80 10 visit punch pass.

The birthday service is ok,  there are no \"private\" party rooms, just portions at the back.  The play space is large and fun for kids of a wide age range. My child is excited for every birthday party there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michael DuBois\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Our experience with Coconut Cove was terrible from beginning to end. We booked a birthday party there for our 6 year old and some of his friends. The play equipment was not clean and there were a few areas that seemed unsafe, some holes in the netting, etc. The party attendees, including the birthday boy, left feeling pretty let down by the lack of rule enforcement and general mayhem. When trying to address these issues, we couldn't find a single adult employee to address these concerns. There were a few tennage-aged employees who didn't seem to know what was going on.\n\nThe real kicker in all of this, is that after we checked out with the front desk and left, they later had trouble running our card for the remaining balance due, which resulted in the owner reporting us to the Centerville Police for theft. After speaking with a police detective, we (ofcourse) paid the unpaid invoice. Needless to say, we won't ever be back to Coconut Cove again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janna Lieber\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We love going to Coconut Cove.

Place was dirty with wrappers, hair bows, garbage in the play area the whole time we were there.  Employee walked around 3 times in 2 hrs carrying a spray bottle and garbage in visible site still did not get picked up.

It could be cleaner, though. And my suggestion for improvement would be to place hand sanitizer around the playground? Also the floors are slippery and kids are running around in their socks… seems a bit like a recipe for injury. Overall, a fun place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ryan Anderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Fun place to take the kids when the weather is not so inviting.  There is a huge, multilevel playground inside with obstacles and slides galore.  It’s a children’s indoor paradise!  The admission price is decent at first glance BUT it is for an unlimited amount of time…so take advantage of it!  With that said, kids get hungry when they are running around.  Coconuts cove does allow you to bring water inside.  They have some cheap, healthy snacks for purchase to help keep the little ones going.  For birthdays, it is a great place too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jay Paul Werner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 6 months ago\nReview: We've been here twice now and my kids love it!

My toddler had fun, the entrance price and snack prices are good, but it felt gross. My toddler unfortunately had a pee accident, my fault, I grabbed Clorox wipes and paper towels to clean it up and let staff know. It’s my mess and I’m fine cleaning it up but they didn’t even help keep kids off that area or anything. Didn’t move a finger. I guess that why it feels dirty there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: steve martinez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My Grand daughter loved this place the little  separate area for toddlers and crawlers was perfect for her.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joshua Dance\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Super fun indoor playground.

I wish I was smaller or had this place when I was younger. There are so many fun activities to do within the play area. Things that spin, shoot little foam balls, to swing on, to slide on, to climb on. I went as an invitee to my nephew's birthday party that was hosted by Coconut Cove. They supplied pizza. Our party had 4 of them. They brought out 1, then 2 more after a while, and 1 more again a bit after that. It was strange that only a small number of people were able to eat at a time. I'm not sure on cost. I didn't have to pay anything to enter as part of the party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alli Jean\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Came here for the first time with my daughter for a birthday party. While playing my daughter was pushed down on the trampoline multiple times. This child then sat on my daughter after I told him not to do that and scratched her face. His parents were not around so I informed an employee who told me all they could do was tell the child not to do it (but not until another employee came to cover her at the desk) and that it was up to the parents to make sure kids are not acting that way. This is not acceptable. If a child is hurting other children staff should be allowed to ask them to leave. My daughter has visible scratch marks on her face where the child broke skin as well as a rug burn from when he pushed her from behind on the trampoline. We will not be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Steven Perry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The kids love it\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Madison Romig\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: SO MUCH FUN!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chase Saxton\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Conveniently located and a fair price.

We bought the punch pass so we never question the cost when they ask to go. It took us 1.75 years to use it because the kids don’t love that it’s far away for us (almost 25 minutes). They don’t ask to go often. But it has been a great tool in the tool belt to keep them busy in the summer, on a rainy day, or when I need a break. It keeps them entertained. We also got a similar place closer and plenty of parks and museums, but this one helps us mix things up now and then despite being farther. It’s nice to be able to relax while they play in a safe environment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A.M.G. F.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: My daughter was invited to a birthday party and I expected it to be super loud like previous places we had been to. I was pleasantly surprised to find the noise level wasn't what I expected. It's a big jungle gym with mazes, bouncers, balls, and slides. It dawned on me that there were no fans going as there were no massive blow-up toys. The kids had fun, and the parents could visit without yelling over massive fans going. I would say it was a good experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: P Ramos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 11 months ago\nReview: Some things are in disrepair, but they have the merry go round working\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Findlay\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: There were some fun activities for my older kiddo, but the overall feel was kind of dirty. The floors were gray, and the baby area was not very appropriate for my crawling baby. The floors were covered in crumbs and other garbage, which he naturally tried putting in his mouth. There was also like a giant soft toy the size of the wall in there that was easy for a baby to pull up on and have topple on them. There were honestly mostly older children playing in that section, even though it's only for babies. I understand that's the parent's job to watch, but I would recommend a better enclosure or something like maybe a baby gate or something? There was just a large soft block in place of a door, but my crawling baby kept climbing over it instead of playing with the other toys so I had to just stand next to him the whole time ensuring he didn't go over head first and hit his head. If it were more secure I could have at least sat down at the table right next to the baby zone instead of hovering. The other thing is that it's super difficult to see inside the play place. If parents aren't really supposed to be in there with their kids but are to watch their kids, there really needs to be some way to observe what is going on. There were multiple times I lost track of my son for several minutes just because of the layout. Maybe adding in mirrors or something to make it easier to see what is going on would make it a less stressful experience.\nI think there is great potential. I love the idea of this place. I think people should support it, and hopefully management will continue to make improvements so our kids will keep having a fun indoor space to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jae D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A great option for kids gyms. It's not the largest, but it's got great variety and fun slides. They have both a babies and toddlers section in addition to the main area. Well air-conditioned on a 100 degree day. Snacks are reasonably priced and the staff are friendly and care about the area. It's very clean. A nice place for the kiddos to run around and parents to relax. We'll absolutely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Robin Mikolyski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids, ages 6 and 9, has a great time.

Even all the adults seemed be enjoying themselves and playing along. We arrived right when they opened on a Friday and by noon, the place was packed with people. It was pretty clean and I saw the one employee  wiping the play area and tables down frequently. Pretty much when she wasn't helping a customer in any way, she was cleaning. All these other reviews claiming it was dirty, I think they're just being over the top and expecting the place to look brand new and never touched, which is impossible. I did see the sit and spins that were mentioned in other reviews that had damaged padding on the corners. They were  still damaged when we went, but they didn't seem to be a safety hazard either. And all of the air guns didn't seem to be working, which was a bummer, but there's so much else to do in there so it wasn't too much of a disappointment. I would recommend grippy socks for sure after seeing many kids slip and fall in the cement flooring outside of the play area. And their pizzas are a little small, but they aren't bad for the price. They don't taste like a frozen pizza someone just tossed in the oven. We felt like we were eating a made from scratch pizza.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Coons\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: It's fun for the kids.

The only 2 employees I could identify (teenagers browsing Pandora together), could not be bothered to observe several kids running up the tall slides with their socks off, crashing into other kids with their socks off, causing them to cry. \"Do you guys police kids with their socks off running up the slides and crashing into other kids?\" \"We try to... (back to Pandora). Top 5 posted rules all broken. 1) Little to no parental supervision. 2) Socks not being worn by 25% of ALL kids everywhere. 3) Kids climbing up slides (en masse). 4) Rough play abounds. 5) Outside toys all over the place.\n\nYou have to do better, owners. I had to be overly vigilant and police other people's kids. If anyone has a lawsuit originating on 4/6/24 from 4:15-5:45 pm, let me know in will witness to the incompetence of the staff and the negligence of ownership.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: karen Camuñez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Hi, Karen.

My only critique is that because it goes so far back it’s almost impossible to watch your kid the whole time. And there are often other parents that aren’t watching their children so stuff could happen up in the play area and no adults would ever see it. Love the baby play area though! Great idea and great play set, would just love to see it separated or better view for parents towards the back to watch their kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bob Berger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Nice chill place to let the kids run and make pseudo friends while you do a tiny bit of work at the tables.  opportunity to give your attention first to your kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gerardo Vázquez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fun, safe, clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Klebe\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The kids loved this place but a lot of stuff didn't work and we got very sick.

The price is ridiculously high, though.

I felt sick the entire time I was there, once I left the property it’s like my soul could finally breathe and I felt better within 5 minutes. This place is super tiny too. The prices on their tvs for food and drinks are wrong as we got charged more than what was advertised on the screen even after we told the lady that it’s cheaper on the screen and got a reply of “oh well we haven’t changed it yet”….  Kidstopia and Hangtime is WAY better and has way better vibes/energy. This place felt like a daycare, the whole vibe was off. Wouldn’t recommend this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cheryl Lindsay\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 days ago\nReview: My grandkids absolutely love it here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: AW Transportation\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Seth McNeill\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: you get what you pay for\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lea Campbell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Becky Evans\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Not very clean\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samanta Campos\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: It's a giant playground, my kids had a lot of fun, the maximum age for them to play there is 12 years old.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lily Bedolla\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: When you enter it smells a lot like feet but that is expected cuz it’s a kids place with no shoes on. I have toddlers so it was a bit more difficult for me bc my daughter was scared of getting hurt and she wanted to go on a the toy wheel where it spins several kids but the same big kids kept spinning for like two hours they would bump the younger kids they would even bump into the fence with their body parts flying everywhere not caring who goes near them they should have more consideration for the others around them but that’s not the businesses fault but I felt maybe they need like a worker by that station just letting them know what’s safe and what’s not bc the three workers were just in the counter chit chatting and just signing people in when someone walked and the kids looked like wild animals a lot of screaming mostly the older ones cuz they would do things without looking where they were doing or going and it would cause accidents and clashing but the place itself they have a lot of fun sections for the kids to play the toddler section was nice too especially since I did notice that was a pretty safe area bc the older kids weren’t aloud on it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B S\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: The playground was great!  It had a smell, like a daycare?  But that comes with this age group I guess?  I would suggest some fresh air or some smell goods :). Other than that the kids had a fantastic time.  Ages 2-8 all had lots of fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Saundra Johns\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Such a fun place, and the kids absolutely love it! One suggestion: it would be great if the 4-and-under area could be better enforced. We had young ones in that age group who weren't able to enjoy the space because it was taken over by older kids and adults.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ayyeee_its_sammy 117\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My boys love it here 💙  thank you!!! …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miranda Steed\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 4 months ago\nReview: Amazing employees who made the experience so great!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandon Burger\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Bait and switch! We decided to try out Coconut Cove after seeing 2 and under was $6 with a parent free to watch over them on their website. When we got there, we were told it would be $12 for the parent with the kid free. When we tried to explain the discrepancy to staff, they looked at us like we were crazy. It’s a shame since this place is much closer than the new Big Green in Saratoga, but I guess we’ll have to make the drive from now on.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Peter Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: An excellent indoor play park that our 19 month old loved exploring and trying all the slides and the fun ball float area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bruno Fontoura\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: If your kid is sick, please STAY AT HOME, thank you 🙏🏼 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsea Austin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I love that there are no arcade games here and my kids can run and get some energy out.

Overall it was really good ! Very reasonably priced and lots of variety of fun to be had. I brought my 1 yr old and the ball cannon sound did scare her and it is quite loud. I know it's fun but i don't think they are needed. Kids weren't even shooting the balls they were just doing it to scare the little kids and make noise. Loved that they had affordable grab and go snack options. The toddler area is a bit small but it seems a place geared for maybe 5 & up anyways. That being said I will definitely go back. Happy it wasn't busy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Balwanth Reddy Bobilli\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the review!

I understand keeping the temperature a bit lower in the summer but for the fall, it was so cold. My kids had a blast and there is a lot of fun things to do. We will go again, but I’ll make sure to bring an extra coat 😂 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J.\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited 7 months ago\nReview: The last time we came in about November or December 2023 and it only cost $5 a kid for the entire day. This location is a ways out of our area, so it has been something I keep in the back of my mind if we're ever close by. The price has more than doubled, $10.50 now each kid no matter how long they play. 2 years old and younger play for free. I asked why the price doubled, but the girl at the front desk had only been working there a month and replied with 'inflation? I don't know when or why it changed. I'm just a teenager'. Lol\n\nUpdate: Following the business' response, I realize I was relying on what my friend had said when referring me here--and confusion occurred about the price because I didn't know whether we had paid for parents or not. Please forgive the confusion! I've kept this review to 4 stars. Kids love it if you're in the area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joshua Meibos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Playground is a blast for kids. My toddler can stay here all day, and even at 2 years old, can use just about everything here. For an indoor playground, it's quite clean compared to others I've seen.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaynee Jarvis\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: It was great but party rooms were boring\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alyssa Dixon\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: 3 stars because though there are a lot of great things about it, the policies are just dumb. The staff was great, it was a fun place, pretty clean, and pretty good equipment - though it's not well lit, the drinking fountains were broken, and it was pretty cold inside. We had fun playing for my son's birthday party, but their party policies are unclear and confusing. Nowhere, when I booked the party (which includes entrance for 10 kids), did it say you can only arrive 5 minutes prior to the room reservation, which I didn't appreciate because I wanted to schedule the room for 5:00pm but couldn't because that wasn't an option (even though no one had the room booked before us) and we wanted to start the party then and play before eating pizza and cake at 6:00 (playing before eating, so kids don't get sick). It took several phone calls and convincing the manager to let us play before our room reservation (even though when we got there, there was almost no one else there). The website and signs on the door say \"No outside food or drink\", but then there is a place to eat food and the other guests I saw there were eating outside food, so it's stated everywhere but not enforced? For the party, we couldn't bring outside food (aside from the cake and water bottles), and had to order through them. BUT they only offered a couple kinds of pizza, and it turns out, they just go buy it from Marco's in Lindon. Good pizza, but why couldn't I buy it from Marco's or anywhere else myself and bring it in? Then I would've been able to have more choices than just pepperoni or cheese pizza. Plus, the staff member who went to pick it up got lost so we couldn't start our pizza party in the room until 25 minutes after our scheduled time anyway (poor kids were getting hungry). I asked if we could bring in a veggie or fruit tray (minimal mess and something healthy) and they absolutely refused saying it was against policy, but they don't offer anything healthy, just the pizza and juice boxes. I assumed they would have enough plates for us since we ordered 8 pizzas, but they only provided 10 plates for the kids (I guess adults don't get plates). I didn't know so I didn't bring our own and then they charge 50 cents a paper plate if you want any extras. It's truly wild! So yeah, the play place is safe and fun for the kids to play, but their party policies are nuts and don't make any sense, so I can't fully recommend it, for a birthday party, at least.\nAnd FYI, the party rooms are pretty small so the kids fit fine but the adults were crowded around the edges just standing with only a few able to sit.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Peterson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: My toddler loved this place, very clean and friendly staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Courtney Bengry\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Visited for our first time today and my kids absolutely loved it, it’s clean and my kids could have spent all day here, however, the only thing that was disappointing was it isn’t allergy friendly. We noticed maybe a hour in that multiple kids were eating uncrustables, then running back out into the play area, and as someone myself & with kids with severe peanut allergies it put me into panic mode instead of being able to relax and have fun, and we had to leave. They also have all over the website and doors no outside food or drinks and almost every parent in there had outside food and drinks, which just caused more worry with my kids and their allergies. Like I said it’s cute and fun and I wish we could have stayed but our trip was cut severely short because my kids safety was put at risk, it should at least be listed that kids need to wash hands before reentering play area or a suggestion to have a peanut eating zone to help navigate and include more children to play because allergies are so huge nowadays.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Abinadi Juarez\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Thanks for coming in, Abinadi\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joyce “Lovin Livin”\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We brought our grandkids here for the day.  It was just about perfect for their ages, 1.5-4 yrs.  They really enjoyed themselves, and Coconut Grove made it really difficult to get hurt! 🤣 Everything is padded. Lots of fun in a smaller indoor space.  Great chutes and ladders entertainment, as well as a separate area for the youngest tykes.\nThey actually offer healthier snacks and boxed juices for a decent price.  I liked that!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lil scumbag\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: My kids loved this place and it was nice to have a little bit of a break while the kids have fun plus it's not terribly expensive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Young_ Mischief801\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Nieces and nephews absolutely love this place also that cool beans ice cream that they have here is freaking good I usually just take the kids to grab the ice cream haha\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Isaias Gomez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Thanks for coming in and thanks for the review!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bryan Nlapx\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Basic place.

Almost everything is visible from the ground level and there's lots of couches and chairs and tables for just relaxing. Kids had a blast as well. Parking can be kind of bad since most spots are reserved for the other businesses but it didn't stop us\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dan Cano G.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This is the place my children always want to go, there is a toddler area, kids area and party rooms to celebrate their birthdays.

My kids could be there all day. My only complaint is that the young girl at the front desk was on her phone the whole time we were there. You could tell she was FaceTiming someone and then texting the rest of the time.

This place is DISGUSTING! As soon as we walked in the smell of PEE immediately hit our noses. We couldn’t get over the smell it was terrible. It was muggy and at one point while playing I smelled poop on a fabric part of the play area. We washed our hands and left! Didn’t even last 20 mins.

It’s bigger than you think when you walk in since it goes back so far. It’s nice you can walk around the entire perimeter to check on the kids and there are benches along the lengths of the sides as well.\n\nI thought you could get pizza there from the website, but that’s only true if you schedule a party in advance and then they have it delivered. They don’t make pizza on-site. Which is fine. We just ordered dominoes afterwards :).\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelsey Hales\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My son had a blast.

This is not a place for small children. They have an area for three years and under, but the rules aren’t enforced. There were big kids in that small area for part for the time we were there. When we were playing in the back with the trampolines, most kids were unsupervised. My one year old had a 10 year hit her in the face a couple times with balls. Even though we were with our baby. Most of the parents were in the front socializing letting their kids run around doing whatever they want. The floors foam tiles were dirty and not cleaned. Some tiles were even overlapping and not connected causing a tripping hazards. I really wanted to like this place. :/\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cory Dodge\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My daughter's love this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebekah Ellenberger\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The kids always love going to this indoor playground.

It would be nice if there were a bounce back option for when parents have to run to pick up other kids from school or whatever the circumstances. We would have come back and paid for an additional 2 children but because the policy is that you have to pay for the child that's been there already that day a second time, we didn't return at all.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Addy Slade\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute little place!

It was a good experience for the most part! The kids had fun, I love that the room was set up for the party with plates and juice boxes for the kids.\n\nHowever, we had issues with being able to order food for the party. We had reserved the date months ago, and on the website it said we would be able to order pizza through the facility, which was great because they didn’t allow any other outside food. I called the week of the party to verify the details, and they told me they wouldn’t be able to get pizza because the pizza place wouldn’t be open until the afternoon. This was frustrating because I was counting on having lunch for our guests, and if it was noted on the website or if I was made aware of this prior to the party I probably would have gone somewhere else.\n\nAlso when we got to the playground we saw that another party had brought in pizza, even though it was made clear to us that outside food wasn’t allowed, aside from cupcakes.\n\nAnyway, other than that we had a decent experience. I don’t know if I would do a birthday party again, but I might go back with my kids just for the day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: sadie horne\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a fun play place!

There is just so much for them to do and they’re able to get all that energy out… although the last time I came, I asked cashier lady upfront why my total was so much… I always thought it was if you pay for an older kid if the other child is two or younger they’re free… Not only did she say that’s not the rule anymore she charged me as both of my children were older so instead of coming here thinking I don’t be paying $10 It was that Double that… And if anything, it should’ve been the $5.50 I thought, and then the $9.95… But the lady already seem to be not the best mood, so I just let it go. But it takes our family 25 minutes just to get here and after this, I honestly don’t know if it’s worth the drive anymore…. But besides that the facilities are great, and I really do love coming here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katelynn Pugmire\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cute place for kids. Lots of fun things to do. Favorites were the long slides and the balls that blow into the air. Like that they don’t charge the parent, and only charge the child.\n\nThings I would like the company to consider include:\n\nMost importantly- a way to ensure that those who enter with a child exit only with that child. Safety was a concern while there because there is no checking on who leaves with who. This I see as a big deal as a parent.\n\nWays to make the play area a bit more visible. The dark netting makes it challenging sometimes to see your child.\n\nHaving a separate area for different age groups. Having ages 3-12 all in one space leads to very very big kids in with little littles, often in spaces parents are not.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dixie Christensen\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I’ve had three birthday parties here now and had the best experience the past two times.

I was able to bring my laptop and get all my work done. I loved that they have snacks there for the kids and I got a protein drink. They also had cute socks there for my kids to wear. I sat in the massage chair while they were playing part of the time as well. We will be back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: M.D Luffy\nRating: 3/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Edit: response to owner. There's no record of my email because I didn't play. I watched my niece and nephew play. This was not written by a former employee. If that's how you run a business, accusing reviewers of things, consider business lost.\n\nI've been quite a few times, and last year the place was always managed really well. They used to have reminders to parents and children about climbing the slides, throwing things and just a general \"play nice\". We recently went back and there were too many kids being super rude, climbing the slides, pushing, throwing cars up the big slides. Parents weren't doing anything and the staff was just sitting behind the desk not doing anything too. Very frustrating, I miss when the staff would remind parents and children either over the speakers or in person about the rules. The playground itself is clean and sturdy but the staff not doing anything was really disappointing and troubling! There was a staff member there a year ago who was fun and did little reminders a year ago that was always really soft to our kids, can't remember her name but she always had fun hair colors too, we miss her. Think she quit or was fired which is disappointing. Like why fire someone who actually kept your rules up and reminded everyone about them? Or maybe she quit because it was always so hectic. I'm not sure, either way I miss the old coconut cove.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Freeman Cox\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My granddaughter loves Coconut Cove! I don’t know about other people, but we are quite happy the girl with crazy hair colors is no longer there. She wasn’t very friendly! We love how clean it is, and how friendly the employees are when we come in. Definitely recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Seamons\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had such a great experience with my son’s birthday party.

As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Frankie Patetta\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I've had the pleasure of working with Bailey on a business level. It's so clear to see her love and passion for her business and all the kiddos. She takes pride in her work and has been nothing but supportive to us in our journey as well! She's truly a legend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mandy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: It's quiet. I actually got to have a complete conversation with my sister over a wonderful cup of coffee. Yes, you read that right. I, a Mama, got to complete a thought. And have a conversation. And complete a sentence. Without an interruption. Do you know how rare that is?! All while my little one ran around, made new friends, and engaged her imagination. Guilt free I got to sit here and recharge. Wonderful. Great staff. Kind. Welcoming. I highly recommend. Will be coming back here AND bringing others. 🙌🏼\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Calm and clean. Like you're at home.

It allows my oldest to have some play time with other friends and my baby to meet others. There are times when I need to work and able to step away to focus on it. Wonder and unwind is the best place for little ones. Bailey always has a warm and welcoming vibe and her team is the best.

She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.\n\nThe space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.\n\nEven after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsey Flores\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This is such a great concept for parents wanting to have their littles near while we can get work done, I can’t wait to see Wonder & Unwind grow and even possibly into a bigger space (or maybe expand on the “parents” section) because if one is working or reading, the kids can still be pretty loud or present. But again, great concept and very clean space. We enjoyed our time here. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawntel Bacon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place to bring the young ones.

She is special needs and the layout was very detailed and the play structure was accessible. Staff from front desk to employees in the individual rooms were also very helpful and nice!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shadi Amirshahi\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Overall, the staff is kind and professional, which I appreciate.\nUnfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.\nI won’t be returning to this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: vidya m\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I LOVE THIS PLACE!!\nThere are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.\n\nThey offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.\n\nI’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.\n\nI truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Erney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I live in AZ but always make a point to bring my son when I'm in Reno- he loves it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Haynes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Love this spot!!

There are always friends and activities to play with, and their staff is friendly and engaging with them so I can unwind or focus.  I’ve made some great mom-friend connections sipping my coffee chatting in the lounge, and I’ve also had a needed nap or two on the couch.\n\nI bought a punch pass and love the freedom to come 2-3 times a month, or not feel like I’m missing out on membership dues if my kids are sick for two months.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ROBIN ABDULLAH\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wow this place is amazing for the little ones. Love the concept of a indoor playground. They have parking onsite. There are safety gates in place for the kiddos. came to happy hour during the week it was not too busy. They gave me a tour of the facility. was introduced to the staff. One of my friends told me about this place and we got a chance to check it out. They have an adult lounge with free Wi-Fi and a tea bar for drinks. The workers met were so nice. I'm definitely going to have to come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Hedman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: As a parent coach, play therapist, and parent; this place is amazing. It is such a wonderful place to take kiddos, enjoy the cafe, and either engage with your kiddos or get work done. They have a very friendly staff that is always there for extra eyes on your kiddo. They provide open ended toys to promote development and encourage the use of imagination. The owner is always friendly and remembers you by name. I highly recommend this place for anyone with children under 6.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Vizzusi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We love Wonder and Unwind!

It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.\n\nI wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.\n\nLastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S V\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place is good for infants and toddlers to spend some good time. It would have been better if the sqft would have been more. There is a place for parents to sit and have some food and do some personal work.

We had my son's second birthday party and my daughters first birthday party here. Great fun for toddlers. Clean, safe, There’s a very big play area for a variety of ages, nice seating area for adults to relax or work. Snacks, coffees or tea are available for purchase at a very reasonable price.

It's a beautiful, clean, and safe space for my kids to play and learn. The staff is wonderful and they do their best to monitor, conflict resolve with the kids, and of course play with the kids.

It’s safe clean and overall a great experience for myself and the kids. I tend to play with my kids for a bit and then take a break in the lounge area with one of their house made tea lattes. It’s my go to place to give myself a break and get my kids energy out. Great for ages 6mo and up. They have a 2 and under room and 3 other rooms for the kids to explore. We’ve been coming here since 2021 and highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tatiana Scott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I have been taking both of my boys to wonder and unwind since they first opened.

As a single mom of two who works full time and is in school Wonder and Unwind has been my lifeline and my sanity 🖤 I have found so many new mom friends and support here.

The staff is always warm and friendly, and they have the coolest activities in each room. The other neat thing I have not seen at any other playground type environment is caregiver staff that are nurturing and watching for safety issues. The other bonus is the cafe for great snacks, yummy drinks, and the parent WiFi to get something important done if needed. Thank you Bailey, this is something I wish they had in more places!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara Flanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5-star rating, Sara!

It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devyn Doty\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I love this place! I get work done and my kids get to play in a safe environment!

There were older kids running through out the space, even in the smaller spaces designated as quiet areas. These kids took toys from one space to another even though they were told not to. They were very possessive and not willing to share the toys. 5 of these children left with one of the women who was working there.\nI was not impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrea Fish\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Every time my grandchildren go there, they get sick a day or 2 later.

It's so nice to meet here with other momma friends, grab a tea or coffee, and sit back as our little ones play.\n\nWonder and Unwind is truly a GEM for parents. We are so thankful to have found them. If you haven't brought your kiddos before, I definitely recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lilly Moore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for younger kids.

Everyone was nice and staff does a good job maintaining the stores and keeping them clean. Will definitely come back. I like the reservation blocks, that way it doesn’t feel overcrowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joy Harbison\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Really nice alternative indoor playspace for young children. There is no climbing structure but it is designed like a little town . Children can go grocery shopping,  change a tire in a car garage,  make a pizza in a pizzaria, deliver mail, go to a salon and a few more places. They give them a couple hours to play with seemed like the right amount of time. My daughter had her 4th birthday party there and it was the perfect age for the imaginative play. It was strange that they charge for the second adult and don't provide anything to adults , so the price adds up quick if both parents want to go either to a birthday party or just regular visits. Other than that rule the place is great and a very nice place to go with the vegas inclimate weather.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Holly Montoya\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This is the 2nd visit with my Granddaughter’s, last time they had soo much fun in this cute town it was buzzing with creativity and warmth the staff was amazing ! Great place to bring the kids,an adults have a nice relaxing area with full view of your little one’s keeping the town busy ! Neat thing is they have snacks too! awesome rice crispy treats Carmel coconut chocolate one was soo yummy!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruby Perez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: I LOVE this place. Brought my 2yr old here and it was amazing. You have to make a reservation as they only allow a certain amount of kids per play slot. All the areas are targeted appropriately for the littles.\nThe place overall is clean (saw staff constantly cleaning) and organized (staff constantly putting stuff where it belongs) which makes it great for kids to just continue playing 🤗\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maranda Wooley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: I love this place for my daughter (who’s almost 2). It’s a little play town where she can interact with each station and really let her imagination come to life! I love how they decorate for the seasons! During the summer they did 4th of July decorations with an adorable little “parade” and “fireworks” show. Now that it’s Halloween they did a puppet show that was trick or treat themed. Very chill atmosphere, not super large or overcrowded. It’s a nice place to sit and catch up with friends while the kids play too. Highly recommend ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erin Bithoulkas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We are frequent fliers at Toodley Town! My kids love it here. We’ve had play dates here with other friends and I’ve also gone with just my 2 kiddos. I’ve often seen working parents seated at the tables while their kids are playing (such a smart idea). The staff is always helpful and kind. The restrooms are clean, there are refreshments available at the front for purchase, and you can book them for birthday parties.\n\nMy only wish is that they’d rotate toys between play sessions. Maybe if they had duplicates of everything they could use UV sanitizers or cleaning wipes and someone could clean everything in the back during one session and then rotate them for the next. I know that’s a big ask/expense so it might not be realistic.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mel Bartels\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: My 3 yo absolutely loved this place! She wished she could stay longer. The limited capacity is nice so kids have more of a chance taking turns with things. I do wish the playtime was a little longer because we didnt get to explore every part of the town. It also takes my daughter some time to warm up to exploring on her own. I really loved all the thought out details in each play area. The whole place  is very beautifully made! We definitely will return.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: E Baker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: A great indoor place for children to play in  a imaginary town.\nReservations are required for a 2hr play window.\nAlso they have a food menu.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Duong\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I wanted to share a great recommendation with you! If you have a daughter, you should definitely take her to this amazing place .This such a  Paradise Market for Kids. 🌟👧\n\nThis place is an absolute paradise for kids as they have a wide variety of stores. From a beautiful flower shop 🌸 to a delicious pizza shop 🍕 and even an ice cream shop 🍦, they have everything your little one will love.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was how clean and new everything was. I believe they must have recently opened, as all the facilities are well-maintained and sparkling. The staff members are always active, checking on each store frequently, and ensuring that everything is restocked for us.\n\nMy daughter and I had the best time there! We enjoyed every moment of it. 😄❤️\n\nHope you get a chance to visit this place soon. Highly recommended!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Austin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: The cutest indoor kid play place.

The interior is so charming and the staff were friendly and provided excellent care. Definitely coming back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charlotte Ashborn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We LOVE to come here! Mornings are great for socializing because it’s usually busy. Evenings are great for quiet play.\n\nI bring my laptop sometimes to do work while my son is happily entertained for a couple hours! Fantastic staff and the winner is the snack pack that keeps my little one going.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Janice “Jan” Hartmann\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: If you have a young child ages walking to eight ,  I highly recommend bringing them to Kids Town to play independently with the other children.\n\nIt's the perfect environment for their imagination to grow while exploring their own little town. Imagined by the owners' dream for children to have their own playtown, then hand crafted by her husband.  It's the most unique play experience in the area!\n\nReasonably priced for every two-hour experience, so that with a limited number of children participating at one time, they all benefit from being able to enjoy all the activities within the town. There's everything with working features; from a house, a school, a beauty shop, a pizza parlor, bakery, hamburger shop, car garage. Post Offiice, Toy shop with creative play, a Veterinarians shop to a market with adorable baskets to fill up their grocery cart with actual store items. Every detail is fashioned after real life with the child in mind.\n\nThey allow outside food and drink, although one can buy snacks and beverages there, one must sit at the tables proovided across the dividing street from the town to enjoy and watch your child at play.\n\nThe restrooms were clean and well stocked. I liked that the water fountain even included free refills for water bottles.\n\nPictures say a lot, so enjoy the ones I took, and I hope to see you there!!\n\nWe visited again for Christmas this year, on December 19th, and our grandson loved it even more I think, at age 4!\n\nThe entire staff is kind, couteous, and engaging! I apprecate their generous offerings for the children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jenetta Sawyer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I absolutely love this little place. For just $15, you and your little can attend this mini town. There are multiple “buildings” inside including a grocery store, bakery, and school house. Each has its own theme and items inside. There are snacks to purchase, the bathrooms are clean, and the workers are always walking around to help make sure kids are staying safe and helping to clean up. There is also PLENTY of seating for adults to sit as their littles explore.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Truong\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: So happy to have found this place. Super cute and really well done. They have lots of different \"businesses\" your toddler can play at.\n\nIt's well maintained and everything is in the right spot.\n\nI love their closing announcement too (won't spoil it here though).\n\nThey run two hour sessions so just something to note for your visit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kris M.\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This town is the cutest place ever! Our toddlers (4 & 2) had so much fun pretending. A lot of they're playing time at home is very similar, but without the \"real\" atmosphere. My husband and I were even playing with our girls. You would have to set a reservation to go in, which is great. Helps with crown control. It's definitely a twice a month thing we can do while the older kids are at school.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Cakes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I had my daughter's 7th birthday at Kids Town and it was amazing!!  We bought the venue out and had 29 children and about 24 adults.\n\nThe venue is perfect for the littles!!  While we didn't have any children over 7. I feel like kids might outgrow this stage of play around 8 or 9 tops, I may be wrong!  Some parents who have never been here commented that they would bring their child back, that it was a really cute venue!  It is large enough for the children to spread out so it's not too crowded in any one mini-busines and plenty of tables, chairs and benches for the parents to sit.  The employees came around every-so-often to tidy the toys/accessories, putting the animal stuffies back at the vet, postcards back at the post office and groceries back at the store.\n\nWorking with Becky was a pleasure and she made the planning process a breeze!  I contacted her 3 months prior to the party date and secured my date with a deposit.  She was patient and kind, answering all of my planning questions, making suggestions and recommendations.  It was really nice to know that there are add-ons to make the party planning easier on you:  scavenger hunt to find a key that will 'unlock' the goodie bags and cotton candy tokens from the 3D cotton candy machine.  One month prior to the party the color scheme was verified- as they provide matching balloons, tablecloths, plates, napkins, forks, juice boxes and small 8 oz. water bottles for the amount of children you have in attendance.  They also partner with a pizza restaurant and you choose your menu items and they order it for you.  Becky was wonderful in estimating the amount of pizza/food we needed and making suggestions when asked.  This entire process was seamless and EASY!\n\nThe party room is the perfect size! The existing wall decor/backdrop decorations provided were perfect (sheer backdrop with string lights, candy cart display table and vine greenery panels) and could be dressed up to suit any theme.  We did bring additional decorations like a balloon garland, some flag banners and a party banner to complete the look and everyone commented on how well decorated it was.\n\nMultiple parents commented on how yummy the pizza was and where I got the cupcakes from.  2 orders of chicken fingers were a hit, the BBQ Chicken Pizza was the first to disappear and it was a really cute touch, that someone from the pizza place drew in the pizza box to wish my kiddo a happy birthday.\n\nEveryone texted and said they had a great time at the party.  So I think that sums up our 2 hours at Kids town- it was worth every penny, I had a great experience from start to finish and I highly recommend hosting your party here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Crystal Colvin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Highly recommend! My almost 2 year old couldn’t fully enjoy all of the pretend elements (I love the detail of the post office!) but she still had a great time playing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lydia Jazrawi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had the place for a private birthday party for my daughter, and the owner with the staff made the whole experience amazing!

But mostly the kids LOVED the town 🤍\nGreat place to take your kids to …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mike Burr\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My daughter loves this place! Her imagination runs wild. They have mock house, school, pizzeria, flower shop, post office, hamburger shop, salon, supermarket, veterinarian, pastry shop and mechanic garage. Fantastic place for kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karla Goplin\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Fun spot for younger kids to play and use their imagination. They have a car garage, sweets shop, vet clinic, beauty shop, pizza shop and a few more spaces for kids to play. There are tables set up for parents to sit at and still be able to see your kids. They also offer snack packs up front for purchase.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesica Shapiro\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This place is truly a kids dream. They have every kind of pretend play you could imagine. I actively saw someone cleaning things while we were there as well. My only complaint is that I have a smaller one 3 year's old and even though the place is aimed for his age group it was very difficult for him to play because there was so many larger kids playing and their parents were not watching them. They were bumping into my son, taking his stuff and generally being unruly. I think it would be better if you had a time or day for toddlers instead or an age limit. Having little toddlers mixed with 6+ year olds is too much when the parents don't watch their kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Blasko\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is super cute and something different than the usual indoor play place. You're gonna see the parents who think it's okay to just sit on the sidelines and let their children wreak havoc. The attendees did alright but could have enforced the rules better. Loses a star for not having any changing tables. Overall, my 3 yr old had a great time and we will be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brett-Aaron Jankiewicz\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: The place is a cute little town with different shops. Unfortunately, it needs a refersbish and new toys .\nAlso it wasn't busy at all when we went. 3 kids total. Staff isn't too engaging either, no hello or good mornings from anyone except when checking in.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David Shimamoto\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: A fun kid-sized town perfect for 3-5 year olds. My 4 and 7 year old had a ball! It's small enough that you could let the kids roam and explore on their own. Space is limited so highly recommend reservations via their website.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JJ King\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I brought my son here recently and he absolutely loved it. It is such a cute and unique place for kids to play. The owner and staff are so kind. I'm pretty sure we'll have other playdates here. Make sure you go on to their website to reserve a time session to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Natalie Ortega\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Absolutely adorable atmosphere!

Great vision by the owner and she has setup a one of kind place that'll you want to return if you're looking for somewhere for the kids to stay entertained. Also it's great value. Make sure to book online early at it has limited capacity.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stacy LeFrancois\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Best time ever!!!!

We LOVED our time here. It was very clean so I even felt comfortable letting my crawler explore. We will definitely be returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tawni Galloway\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Loved this place and found it to be a great place to take my little one. She loved exploring, the bakery being her favorite. My only reason for giving it a 4 was that we had a run-in with what I am assuming to be the owners daughter that was not pleasant at all. First, my little one (1 year old) was exploring the bakery, and the owners' daughter came in and told us that we needed to leave. She wanted to clean the place, and we needed to get out now! Another little girl had come in and was pretending to be baking, but then the owners daughter started to block her by stepping in front of her every time she tried to walk or move or grab anything. Later in the hour my little one was standing on the picnic blanket and the same little girl was riding on a balance bike and went off the \"road\" headed straight towards my little one stopped with the front tire hitting her legs and then just stayed there squeaking the little horn on the bike at my daughter. Kids will be kids. i totally get that, and it really doesn't change my opinion about this place, nor will it keep us from returning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chevy Peck\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Really enjoyed this place! Spent 32 $ for 2 kids. I only am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because it does suck that the play time is only 2 hours and they close a little early. Staff is SO sweet and clean. Lots to do here. 2 year old enjoyed it and my 5 year old loved it !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Wagner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Absolutely magical! Your kids are in a safe and contained area and it makes it easy for parents and grandparents to relax and watch them. They LOVE playing like they are grownups with jobs to do in pretend play. So many smiles from parents and kids alike. Nothing like this place ever before! It’s perfection! Specialty drinks and snacks available!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kiley Tobler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We love the unique experience of coming and playing at Kid's Town! Pretend play is so important for kids as they grow and develop. It is clean, the staff is very friendly, and I really enjoy their soda shop and rice krispies! I also love that I can see my kids from the seating area so I can watch them without having to chase them around or worry about them. Definitely recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susie McGivney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I brought my twin 3 year olds to play for the first time today.  They loved it!  It's super cute and well-maintained.  Staff is very friendly. Reasonably priced for 2 hours of entertainment.\nThey've decorated for the 4th of July and I loved that they've added holiday themed play (fireworks stand, parade, \"fireworks\" at the end). This will definitely become a favorite play place for my kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: alyssa raymond\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love Kids Town! I bring my 15 month old son here and he can’t get enough. The staff is friendly and is always on top of keeping the place clean. It’s comforting to see the staff constantly walking around cleaning up and wiping down the toys. We certainly value a clean kids play area! It’s an adorable concept as well. Definitely will continue to bring my son back here.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cortney Oman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Such a cute place for kids of all ages to play! My 2.5 year old twins and 1 year old boy had a blast the full 2 hour play session. The soda shop is such a nice touch and we also enjoyed the $4 snack bag.\n\nThe best part is how amazing all the employees were. They are all so nice and they kept everything cleaned and put together. A place like this has potential to be a disaster and no fun if everything was misplaced, but they were going around cleaning up after all the kids so everyone could continue to have fun.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corina D\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Omg such an adorable place to explore your kids imagination. 😍 My 3 year old had a blast made a ton of friends playing and entertaining themselves. It's only $15 for 2 hours they have snacks and drinks for purchase. …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Davida Washington\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I had higher expectations... customer service was great, but they are way over priced for what they're offering. They're comparable to a small area of the children's discovery museum, but charging more? For less?? 🤔 We arrived in a middle of a session that had 30 minutes left, we were advised we could pay double price to join the current session (for me would've been $32 for my 2 children for 30 minutes of play), or we were advised we could come back in 45 minutes when the new session started. I understand not wanting to over crowd, but there were literally 5 kids and 1 was in a stroller. Kids Town, you should AT LEAST offer a pro rate price for joining a session already in progress ESPECIALLY when there isn't anyone there. I was disappointmented because I was really interested in trying this place out, but after seeing in person, we were very underwhelmed. We ended up going to LOL Kids 6 minutes down the street, paid $20 (with Groupon) and stayed for 3 hours. After this experience we're no longer interested in trying out this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I was impressed. My two girls (5 & 3) absolutely loved our visit. Each part of the town is so well put together, it is engaging and encourages pretend play. I loved all the details, whoever designed this was incredibly creative. We used every minute of our time and will definitely go back when we can.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Heather\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for kids to play.

I’m so happy I did she loved every minute of being here. The staff is very nice. I was skeptical about hygiene but even though the items are very worn I saw the employees constantly cleaning and wiping things down and nothing looked dirty just played with. I got the Caramel Apple soda which was delicious and very cheap another bonus that they offer snacks and drinks for the parents. Overall I recommend this place and I will bring my daughter back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Javana Johns\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: So simple yet so. much. FUN for the kids! Great place for pretend play. It's a good sized single room with not really any corners and plenty of spots for the parents to sit and see their kid. Staff was friendly and helpful to the kids if they fell or just abandoned a toy and they have a drink \"bar\" where you can get coffee, soda, etc. They decorated the party room wonderfully!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Barton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We really loved our visit here, will def be back next time we're in town!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Deborah Ruiz\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We’ve had my Grandkids birthday here the last 2 years and it’s very pricey. This Saturday we got there early to set up and with 15 minutes left until guests would be arriving my Granddaughter started playing. The employee told her and my son in law that she can not play unless they paid for her to do so. IMO, if you’re spending $1000 for a 2 hour party, letting the birthday girl play for 15 minutes should be allowed. It also was not because they were at capacity being she would be able to play if we paid full price for the 15 minutes. Very disappointing for a kids establishment to act this way. We won’t be going back!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joe Hughes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: All the kids had a good time.  Very clean and well organized.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: z g\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The only issue I had with Kids town is I brought my 1 year old son there to play. I also had my 9 year old Daughter there too. She was not playing and only following me so she could also watch out for my son due to there being much larger kids there. The manager told me that my daughter could not be in the play area unless she was paid for. I advised them that she was only following me and not playing with any of the toys. They said she had to stay in the parent area and sit. Then they changed their mind and said I could pay for an additional adult which was $5 so she could be in the play area. I completely do not agree with this due to her being a 9 year old only following me and helping me with my 1 year old son. I do not plan on going back,.\n\nTheir is AC inside the building and lot of kids for your child to play with.  The staff there is nice and every so often tell all parents to make sure their kids are not running for the safety of all kids there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D J\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: I took my 7 and 5 year ago. They had a blast! There’s a lot to do there if you never lose your imagination as an adult. The place stilll smells fresh of paint and super clean. The staff is super nice and well organized. Our favorite place was the Pizza Shop. Only bummer was the “time slots”. We could’ve honestly stayed all day but you’re only allotted about a 2 hour block of time This was a very cool idea. I will definitely be bringing my family back. Oh ! On a side note, make sure to watch your head!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Steven Hoggan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Beautifully detailed play areas with lots of props and toys to play with. Limited group sizes so it doesn't feel too crowded. Plenty of seating for the adults, tables and benches. Very clean bathrooms. Staff resets props often during play sessions, so every kid gets to fully experience each area. Good value,  I paid $14 for 2 hours, my 5 year old had a great time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberlee Butler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I recently had my sons 2nd birthday party there.

It’s extremely clean inside and you can definitely tell so much love and thought has been put into each play area. I don’t understand the bad reviews regarding the reservation system. Do you not research places before you just show up with your kids? A quick glance at the website let me know that I needed a reservation which was quick and easy to do. Can’t wait to come back and have friends join us!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Maggie Pleitez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: What a beautiful space for children to play. I love supporting local businesses and this family owned place is amazing.\n\nEvery little detail was well thought out.\n\nWe just celebrated my daughter's 7th birthday there and it honestly was a hit. From planning to the day of, the owner was amazing in arranging everything.\n\nIf you haven't been, please check them out, you won't be disappointed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karry Dinh\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is super fun for toddlers but they have this weird rule where you have to go between certain times. We got there at 1105. They said the next session starts at 1130 if we want to stay for a full 2 hours. We told them we only want to stay for 1 hour. They said then you have to pay for both sessions 😒 why would it cost more to stay less ,?! Makes no sense. Anyways we stayed for 25 minutes and paid 20$. Little guy was devastated to leave but we had to because of their weird rules.\n\nToddlers have strict schedules, they can lose customers based on the 2 hour session rule. It should be more flexible or even have the option to stay less but not stick to the weird schedule. Seems like a bad business model tbh as there are only 4 sessions in 1 day. I have a toddler where am I suppose to go for 25 minutes to wait for the next session? We don't live here so we can't just go home. Anyways, it's a fun place but I wish they were more flexible with play times\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Elizabeth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Came here with my daughter, very fun and interactive Town!

My inner child was in love— so I am not sure who enjoyed it more, me or my toddler 😍 If you are local, or just visiting, you MUST bring your young kiddos here— it is the best, most original, fun play area we have went to as a family. And the details are amazing— they didn’t miss a thing! Highly recommend! All the stars :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B Sand\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Cool experience, we would come back. Reasonable price. I like the idea of time slots, limited groups, and 'resetting' the play area for each time slot. Clean and friendly. My only feedback would be to consider increasing the amount props and maybe an enclosed crawl type area for little little kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David Eisner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: As a parent it is easy to achieve some peace in this place. Your kid is free to explore and have fun and he is enthralled for the full 2 hours. You can just sit back and listen to the soothing music and not have to worry that your kid is going to find a way to kill themselves every 4 minutes. Or watch your kid be cute doing stuff with a miniature town. Either way, it's just a great place for kids and parents alike.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kristina Quinn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Love love loved this place! There were so many cute little details. We will definitely be back. My daughter was so sad when it was time to go because she enjoyed her entire two hours there.

We did a \"homeschool\" group. And we had a super sketchy situation where a father of some other child was recording our son. Trying to talk to him by himself while he was recording.

I hope everyone will not go there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mary Preister\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Great variety of activities, stores, and worksites.

So many options from imaginary play, things to climb, puzzles, slides, and more! My kids had the best time and did not want to leave! Love supporting a small local business. The owner is so nice and welcoming. Will be coming again soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: michelle johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: My daughter is 21 months and she absolutely loves it. A great place to enjoy with varies play area 🤩🤩 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joshua Iovanisci\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Just went for the first time. My 2 year old loved it. The staff is very nice and everything was well taken care of and clean. It’s a nice alternative for when it’s too hot outside to play. I also liked that it’s for kids 6 and under so I didn’t have to worry about my child getting trampled or pushed over.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: evolved designer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: The playplace was clean and had lots of nice wooden toys and play sets.  Staff was super helpful and was very regularly cleaning up and organizing the toys that little ones dropped on the floor.  Bathroom was also clean and had a nice changing table.  It's hard to find many playplaces in the area for children 2 and under, this place is great!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Levy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This little spot is magical. My 3 year old really loved all the toys and he ended up playing with the puzzles the most. The turf that covers the floor under the player equipment is perfect for any falls or trips.\n\nThe inside is well cooled and I appreciated that with it being so hot outside. I will be visiting again even though it’s about 35 minutes from my house…. That’s how worth it this place is!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anna Renfro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My almost 2 yo had a great time, I could see her the whole time. She needed minimal help on the play equipment. Overall felt safe, clean, and relaxing. There was a variety of toys so she didn’t get bored either.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Spidel\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Very cute, fun, and clean!

I was a little worried there wouldn't be much for her to do because she's not walking or climbing yet but Little Dreams had so many Montessori toys, books and things to explore just perfect for her age group. Everything was clean and the owner was the sweetest!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: lindsey wells\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Very clean, fun environment! My 3 year old had a blast and we can’t wait to come back. Love the fact that you can see where your child is at all times so they can freely go play! The owner was so nice. Easy to locate and welcomed in right away.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Koral Lambert\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This place is great!! Yes, it’s small and that was my only concern compared to somewhere like Kid Clubhouse. But I think it’s much better for younger kids. It’s small so it’s easy to keep track of young kids and it’s much more age appropriate for younger ones. There were also some older kids there that didn’t seem to have any issue with the space. It’s small but it’s quaint, not cramped.\nPlus, you can bring your own food and admission is for the whole day.\nWe will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaylee Miller\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: My son and I had an amazing first experience very organized and clean we will definitely be going back !\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christopher Woosley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Took my three kids to Little Dreams Play Studio and they absolutely loved it! The slide and fireman’s pole were big hits. The Montessori/Waldorf-style play toys are high quality and thoughtfully chosen. The entire space is insanely clean, which as a parent, I really appreciate. The owner is so welcoming, and the environment is calm and relaxing—not too big, so it’s easy to keep an eye on your kids no matter where they are.\n\nWe’ll most definitely be back, and I can’t wait to book a party here!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katy Thorpe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Such a cute and clean place to bring the kiddos on a rainy day!

Perfect for my 2 and 5 year old. The entire establishment was very clean, and due to the size it was fairly easy to keep an eye on my kids while letting them truly explore and learn!

Loved that my little one could go and play as I sorted out the payment. There is a great variety of things for the littles to do. The 1st day he played with all the trucks, 2nd day he investigated the playsets that were laid out (loved the ice cream stand). The place was VERY clean. Can't wait to see how the place grows.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Grace Ulrich\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: The cutest play studio ever! I’ve been waiting for one to open up in Dayton and it’s here! So many perks—bring your own food, $12 for the ENTIRE day, you can leave and go back. My 8 month old loved it! There’s adorable toys for all ages. It’s super clean and the owner is the SWEETEST!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Colt Rhodes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Came because our daughter needed to get out of the house. What a pleasant surprise. It was the best experience we have ever had at an indoor playground. Will tell everyone to drop what they are doing and head over.

We’ve been to other indoor play areas but have found them to be too big or overwhelming for my son. Little Dreams is such a great size for younger kids! Charlesee is so kind as well :) We will definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dawn Young\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucas&Queenie Glandon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Bright, fun and clean!

They also have a good selection of drinks and snacks.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danyell Duibley\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a week ago\nReview: Ball out is only for little in diapers and even though my little was the only one in there they made her get out of it.

I brought my oldest on a mommy/son date and liked it enough to bring both my kids with their cousins. And I just love that it's safe enough that I don't have to be next to each kid 24/7. I can find each one easily. And with such a wide variety of things to do that we can stay all day and the kids still don't want to leave at night. The staff are super friendly and everyone I have met here is so sweet too. Feels like a little community. They regularly have staff cleaning and vacuuming. I don't like how grimey a lot of these indoor playgrounds get so I appreciate that.\nKey points to keep in mind:\n-2 adults included in child price\n-you have to leave to eat outside food (you can bring water bottles and buy food there)\n-You can come back after leaving if it's the same day, just keep your receipt\n-the pink slide gets as fast as a roller coaster going down, so be warned.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Felicia Paige\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: My kids & I loved it had lots of fun I even had fun going down the slide couple times lol\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jeff Upshaw\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Great experience, our kids had a great time here.

The play area is really tall in most places and as a 6' tall person, I was able to move around comfortably and play with the kids. My wife and I had as much fun as they did! The employee, Zak, was super friendly and helpful. We had a great time!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Marc K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Awesome place and lovely staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Josh Lurie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Tons of fun for kids of all ages.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bonnie Stewart\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Great place and atmosphere!

And I agree whole heartedly haha it’s huge and there are amazing snack choices for everyone (even a few vegan options for me!). The slides are fast, obstacles are huge and easy enough that our almost 4 year old could navigate them, the car things are a blast, there’s a dance party spot, and the staff is super friendly (shout out to Sophia for checking us in and getting our snacks and recognizing us when we came back after cat gazing haha!!!). I definitely foresee many trips here in the future!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jamara Bell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Super fun!

As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Frankie Patetta\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I've had the pleasure of working with Bailey on a business level. It's so clear to see her love and passion for her business and all the kiddos. She takes pride in her work and has been nothing but supportive to us in our journey as well! She's truly a legend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mandy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: It's quiet. I actually got to have a complete conversation with my sister over a wonderful cup of coffee. Yes, you read that right. I, a Mama, got to complete a thought. And have a conversation. And complete a sentence. Without an interruption. Do you know how rare that is?! All while my little one ran around, made new friends, and engaged her imagination. Guilt free I got to sit here and recharge. Wonderful. Great staff. Kind. Welcoming. I highly recommend. Will be coming back here AND bringing others. 🙌🏼\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Calm and clean. Like you're at home.

It allows my oldest to have some play time with other friends and my baby to meet others. There are times when I need to work and able to step away to focus on it. Wonder and unwind is the best place for little ones. Bailey always has a warm and welcoming vibe and her team is the best. Shout out to Tillie and Marina for always giving a helping hand ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Chen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place to unwind!

She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.\n\nThe space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.\n\nEven after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsey Flores\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This is such a great concept for parents wanting to have their littles near while we can get work done, I can’t wait to see Wonder & Unwind grow and even possibly into a bigger space (or maybe expand on the “parents” section) because if one is working or reading, the kids can still be pretty loud or present. But again, great concept and very clean space. We enjoyed our time here. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawntel Bacon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place to bring the young ones.

She is special needs and the layout was very detailed and the play structure was accessible. Staff from front desk to employees in the individual rooms were also very helpful and nice!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shadi Amirshahi\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Overall, the staff is kind and professional, which I appreciate.\nUnfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.\nI won’t be returning to this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: vidya m\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I LOVE THIS PLACE!!\nThere are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.\n\nThey offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.\n\nI’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.\n\nI truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Erney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I live in AZ but always make a point to bring my son when I'm in Reno- he loves it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Haynes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Love this spot!!

There are always friends and activities to play with, and their staff is friendly and engaging with them so I can unwind or focus.  I’ve made some great mom-friend connections sipping my coffee chatting in the lounge, and I’ve also had a needed nap or two on the couch.\n\nI bought a punch pass and love the freedom to come 2-3 times a month, or not feel like I’m missing out on membership dues if my kids are sick for two months.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ROBIN ABDULLAH\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wow this place is amazing for the little ones.

I'm definitely going to have to come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Hedman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: As a parent coach, play therapist, and parent; this place is amazing. It is such a wonderful place to take kiddos, enjoy the cafe, and either engage with your kiddos or get work done. They have a very friendly staff that is always there for extra eyes on your kiddo. They provide open ended toys to promote development and encourage the use of imagination. The owner is always friendly and remembers you by name. I highly recommend this place for anyone with children under 6.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Taylor Vizzusi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: We love Wonder and Unwind!

It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.\n\nI wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.\n\nLastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S V\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place is good for infants and toddlers to spend some good time. It would have been better if the sqft would have been more. There is a place for parents to sit and have some food and do some personal work.

We had my son's second birthday party and my daughters first birthday party here. Great fun for toddlers. Clean, safe, There’s a very big play area for a variety of ages, nice seating area for adults to relax or work. Snacks, coffees or tea are available for purchase at a very reasonable price. The staff is phenomenal!! I recommend this place to let the children get out and play!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellen Cavendor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the 5-star rating, Ellen!

It's a beautiful, clean, and safe space for my kids to play and learn. The staff is wonderful and they do their best to monitor, conflict resolve with the kids, and of course play with the kids.

The staff is always warm and friendly, and they have the coolest activities in each room. The other neat thing I have not seen at any other playground type environment is caregiver staff that are nurturing and watching for safety issues. The other bonus is the cafe for great snacks, yummy drinks, and the parent WiFi to get something important done if needed.

It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devyn Doty\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I love this place! I get work done and my kids get to play in a safe environment!

We stopped in today at the very end of the day to get our wiggles out. I am appreciative of the multiple age designated play areas. Our toddler had a blast and fit right in with play activities with our big kid. Everyone belongs. ❤️\n\nThe staff was absolutely incredible! I don't mean just one-- every single staff member was attentive and generous with their kindness toward our crew. The front desk was great with helping us find the perfect fit with socks. On our way out, they made sure we had stickers to easy the transition of leaving with the boys. They also shared with us about the rewards program and answered all one million of our questions-- even as they were closing up for the day. They modeled kindness and patience with everyone--Truly the sweetest staff ever!\n\nThe nursing and changing room is always so welcoming and calm. I deeply appreciate the space for small sensory breaks in addition to changing. Our boys really appreciate it!\n\nThank you for all you do to make families feel supported and welcome while at Kid Clubhouse!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tyler Shroyer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 4 days ago\nReview: We visited this past weekend for the first time. This place was awesome! Our kid had a blast, workers were always cleaning or keeping an eye on the kids. Our kid is 2 1/2 and really enjoyed the smaller kids area. It was nice to see the employees actually sticking to the 45” rule and politely asking bigger kids to play on the rest of the equipment. Everyone seemed friendly enough too. Something we didn’t consider but loved to see was the ample amount of seating for parents to chill while their kids ran rampant. A great atmosphere, safe and clean, we will definitely be spending cold/rainy days here in the future!\n\nI came to review Kid Clubhouse and forgot I did it a while back ago. But I feel an update is still worth the edit. Since going to KC ~1 year ago, we have visited a number of times since then. My then 2 1/2 year is now almost 4 and still absolutely loves every aspect of Kid Clubhouse. Everything I said in my original post is still very valid. Kid Clubhouse has been unwavering in their commitment to provide a clean and safe place for kids to go. Out of several visits I haven’t had a single complaint about anything. We recently visited this past weekend, and after a couple of hours of playing it was time to go get dinner and head home for the night. During bath time our 4 year old was talking about “the nice man cleaning the steps but he said we could still climb!” That made us chuckle, a few minutes pass and he grabs the wash cloth and starts cleaning the tub walls. He proceeds to tell us “I’m pretending I’m the man at Kids Clubhouse and I’m cleaning!” (Don’t come at me, I say Kid Clubhouse he insists it’s Kids Clubhouse 😂) so if that doesn’t say anything about their values, I don’t know what does! Our kiddo absolutely loves the environment, he makes new friends every time we go, and evidently he appreciates the cleanliness too. Thanks KC for always being there for us tired parents 😅\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: L Wall\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: I've visited many indoor play lands and this one is the absolute very best!   They offer play areas for crawling infants to elementary age.  One of my gauges is cleanliness and this place is clean.  I've seen workers wipe tables and vacuum during the very busy times.  This place is HUGE on the inside with plenty of seating and tables.  Additionally, one pays only one price to stay the entire day.   You are permitted to leave and return the same day - jackpot!  For added security, the parent / guardian is matched to the child(ren) with matching wrist bands.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Stabler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This place is AWESOME!

Hoping they can improve cleanliness or take steps to reduce the spread of germs.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Renelle Wilson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: First time here was today and I have to say, I was beyond impressed and can’t wait to come back - and we live an hour away! Having a very active 2.5 year old means I’ve been to countless playgrounds (indoor and outdoor) and this was the most relaxed I’ve felt as far as safety goes and a new favorite, hands down.\n\nFor starters, the playground itself is adult friendly all the way up to the top. This is crucial for my child’s age.  Some playgrounds you have to just watch from the bottom and hope that they are OK. Or… you think you’re good to join your toddler, and then once you’re up there, there’s a part at the top that is too tight of a squeeze for most adults… then you’re stuck forcing your screaming toddler to come back down since you’re worried about their safety. But even without parents *inside* the playground itself, it was so easy to supervise from down below and I have zero concerns about any areas she could have fallen down or been unsafe in any way. The design is absolutely perfect. Thankfully we came at a not busy time, so she had lots of room to run and play freely for 2.5 hours.\n\nAnd on top of that - the cleanliness was noticed and appreciated so much. Staff was continuously sanitizing every surface. I was surprised to even see a staff member sanitizing a padded pole in the middle of a sitting area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Heaney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Kid Rating:\nMy kids had another amazing time at Kids Clubhouse. My son’s birthday party was a hit, and as always the kids loved it!\nParent Rating: His party started at 5:30p and right next door is The Barrel. I ordered pizza from there to walk right over to get my kids party ready! Beyond convenient and I highly recommend, a great place to have a kids party with pizza right next door!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angela Duncan\nRating: 2/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Hi Angela, can you please email us at info@kidclubhouse.com to tell us about your experience?

I’m currently sitting in an environment full of cheerful children laughing and running around getting out all their energy. The staff is too friendly always cleaning and helpful as can be. This place is too spotless. How is it cleaner than my house I constantly clean up after when it’s just 3 kids and here it’s more than just three kids! I hate it so much because my kids never want to leave and I never want to leave. They make it where I’m allowed to stay and come back even. They have suspiciously good coffee, oddly fast WiFi. My kids have played for HOURS here with minimal crying. They’re demanding me of affordable snacks and I can’t stand how happy everyone is around me. I hate it so much that I keep coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: K M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Amazing place & always packed with kids & bathrooms clean,employees professional,constantly cleaning made.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brian Magee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesse James\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Hartman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We love it here!

The owners and the staff went above and beyond to ensure everyone was taken care of, to include both service dogs that were there and WELCOMED!! Sadly, some places treat others with disabilities and service dogs terribly causing unnecessary trauma (even worse trauma when children are involved), but not here. Here, they right others' wrongs! These people are amazing and have wonderful hearts. The owners of Kid Clubhouse may not be able to take away what happened to Keaton and Murphy at that terrible skating rink, but these wonderful people opened their hearts and their business to a very deserving family and they did everything they could to ensure he had the most memorable birthday ever!!! Please support this business as they support the community and what this world should be about - love and support. ♥️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hayley Coyle\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We rented out Kids Clubhouse for our kids birthday party, and it couldn’t have been more perfect! Both kids and adults had an amazing time from start to finish. The facility was spotless, the play equipment was top-notch, and the staff went above and beyond to make everything run smoothly.\n\nWhat truly impressed us was the dedication of our party hosts — even after attending prom the night before, they showed up cheerful, energetic, and incredibly helpful. They kept everything organized and the space immaculate throughout the entire event.\n\nKids Clubhouse is truly a special place, and we’re so grateful for the unforgettable experience they gave us. Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Darrell Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Dear Ben is my picture awesome art?\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jordan Stephens\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rose\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Brown\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blake\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ann-Kathryn Alvarado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: HOLLY BROWN\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaylee Huffman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Megan Hayes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kenneth Koepnick\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Very cool playplace for kids.

She's a pretty adventurous kid, so being able to switch from the smaller play area to the big one is wonderful for us. Even during busier hours, the kids and parents have been kind and respectful, and I love that the culture there really encourages parents to play with their children (and keep a close eye on them in the process). It's by far the cleanest indoor playground that we've ever been to, and the pricing is so much better than other indoor kid-centered activities in the area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Peyton Leet\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Way too busy they need to consider a lower capacity to make it more fun for their paying customers. Also, if you (respectfully) disagree with what they’re saying on social media, they’ll block you. They posted my husbands review of the place, which was an honest review from a paying customer, and shredding it. I replied to some comments making false accusations about him (and again, I was respectful) and I was blocked. Extremely unprofessional. I’m super disappointed as I was excited to try this place out. Will definitely be sharing how this wasn’t a good experience. I wasn’t even going to post a review on google until they blocked me. They obviously did this to hide and save face. Do better.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ryan Van Loo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We had our son’s birthday party at the clubhouse this weekend.  The kids had a blast!

Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elisabeth Middleton\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Our granddaughter had fun playing here, but the place seemed understaffed. However, the facility appeared clean. Many big kids were playing in the toddler zone, and some children were without socks which are required for hygiene and safety reasons. All the staff who were working seemed friendly and professional, but there was only one staff member who was checking people in and out. We will probably return, but I would have given more stars if there was a heavier staff presence.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kevin Quinlan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: One of my son’s favorite places!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: JSL\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: What a circus.

My son absolutely loves this place! Tons for the kiddos to do! Places to sit for parents. Good wifi to get work done while the kids play. It has it all which makes it convenient for people like me. I am a small business owner myself and things get crazy. Sometimes I have to drop what I’m doing and get some work done. Anyways, with that said, this a good spot to go with the family and if you are like me who may have to get some work done at the drop of a dime, this place has the resources available that accommodate that. Very few places around here cater to both the kids and adults in that sense. The only downside is that the place can get filled up quickly, especially on weekends! Other than that, awesome spot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Misty Marcum\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Love this place.

I wanted to be let in an hour and a half before opening hours on Sunday, and during a private party booking, and was told “no”. I was angry because my entitlement got the best of me that morning and I woke up genuinely confused as to why the world didn’t revolve around me. I’ll be summoning my mom group to let them know this place is def worth the extra $1. Plz dont ban me, I’m already banned from the Dayton Mall’s super cool and totally “clean” indoor play area 🤞🏼\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Asia Richardson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: We had our son's 3rd birthday party here last Sunday and it was perfect! We had the middle room with a window view of the play area which was perfect for keeping an eye on the kiddos. Loved that the room had a sink so everyone could wash their hands before eating. The staff were super friendly and helpful and of course the facility is always so clean! Thanks for my making my boys birthday great! He kept talking about how much fun he had!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Crum\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: The cleanliness at this place is top notch. I always see workers getting into the play area for cleaning and I appreciate that especially during flu season. I also love the matching bands to ensure kids are not leaving with the wrong adult.

Great way for the kids to get their energy out.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brandon Wood\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Cannot say enough good things about this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My son loves it here!

Sometimes the \"no shoes\" rule isn't followed by parents and nobody enforces it (at least when I've been there), but it's overall a very fun place for my kid. Fair pricing too so it doesn't break the bank for days that's either too hot or too cold to spend too long outside.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tracie Fox\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My kids Absolutely loved this place honestly super affordable and great for kids that are younger or kids that are overstimulated quickly\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Khrissa bergman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had my son’s 4th birthday here and it was truly an incredible experience.\nWe did a full facility rental and it was definitely worth the extra money.

From start to finish, the staff went above and beyond to make sure everything ran smoothly. They were incredibly attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to care about making the day special for our kids.\n\nThe party space was absolutely amazing—beautifully decorated with so much attention to detail. It truly felt festive and fun, and it was clear that a lot of care went into making it look perfect for the occasion. The kids were thrilled, and so were we!\n\nThe venue itself was clean, safe, and full of fun activities to keep the children entertained. The staff was great at engaging with the kids and making sure everyone had a great time. It was also a stress-free experience for the parents, which made the day even better.\n\nWe can’t thank Capabilities enough for helping us create such a memorable day.

Today however, knocked it out of the park for us. We booked a party for our 4 year old- I believe it was the Super Duper Deluxe package. We arrived and the room was decorated in Frozen theme we requested, sadly I didn’t get any pictures because we went straight to having fun. The person working (didn’t catch her name) was so kind and let us know if we needed anything to ask her before making a trip out. My girls are 2.5 years apart and they both had so much fun. All of our guests were so pleased. Many of them had never visited Capabiltied before and they were all highly impressed. We had 3 hours and didn’t feel rushed with the 2 hour time limit that many places have. I love the inclusive environment and I’ll shout it from the roof tops- this is a place that deserves your business. 100/10, there isn’t a thing I would change.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Bernard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Staff is very friendly, and there are so many options for accessible play for little ones.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: max zimmer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Definitely a great place for kids who need their sensory needs met. Parents can play with their kids easily here, too. It's quiet for anyone who doesn't like loud noises and they have headphones for your children if it gets too loud as well. They have snacks, drinks and free wifi too. Definitely will be taking my kids back soon\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: This is the perfect indoor playground for little kids! One of the things I love most about this place is that it’s not overly big like other playgrounds in the area. You can easily keep an eye on your kids without feeling overwhelmed or losing track of them. The facility is clean, and the staff is friendly.\n\nI tried the one month membership to see if it would be a good fit, and I absolutely loved it! It was such a great experience that I decided to get the yearly membership. My kids love this place, and it’s become our go to spot for fun and play. Highly recommend it to any parent looking for a safe and clean environment for their little ones!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Reuss\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Great space set up to just play in.

The facility is thoughtfully designed, clean, and engaging for kids of all ages and abilities. All the children had a blast with the variety of activities, and it was heartwarming to see everyone having such a wonderful time. The staff was incredibly kind, attentive, and accommodating, making sure everything ran smoothly. My son and his friends and cousins are already asking when we can go back. Highly recommend this place for any event for the littles.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Justin N\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: An absolutely amazing array of activities for all ages! There are so many unique things here that I have not seen at other places. Ball pits, play equipment, various swings (including wheelchair accessible), foam blocks, play kitchen/grocery, tons of sensory toys, light toys, climbables, etc. There is something for every kid here.\n\nPlease be respectful of the rules so all can enjoy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: madison deneski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I had my daughters 5th birthday here. Not only was this place amazing with awesome toys for everyone including out 11 year old nephew. The ladies who run this place are truly something else. Let me start with I messaged them on the 30th of December looking for a party for January 4th. They were willing to make that happen for me. They gave me a full day to pick a package, a party theme and then gave me the times they were able to host. Sent me the invoice and boom everything was done. I showed up with pizzas and a cake in hand about 10 minutes before the party started. They let us in to sent everything down and apologized for still working. Heck I was the one 10 minutes early and yet they still wanted to make sure I was happy. Before they left our party room they asked me how I liked it, wished the birthday girl happy birthday and helped us out any way that they could. These ladies and the place they own and run are amazing. I highly recommend coming here for indoor play, to have a kids party and to honestly feel like you have walked into a place that will treat you like family. I can 1000% say in all my childhood birthdays and the birthdays I host for my kids no place will ever be or beat them. They are truly the best. Drop that Y membership and get one for capabilities. You will not regret it I promise.\n\n100/10 would recommend them. My kids are excited to go back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kati Agenbroad\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: My daughter has autism and we just celebrated her 16th birthday party here.

She'll gladly play here for hours. Her favorite part is the kitchen/store area. We try to go for special events like their New Year's balloon drop. They do a fantastic job with decorations and party favors. Make sure you get there early though, it might fill up!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexa Thomas\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Capabilities for all abilities is AMAZING!

We had the entire place to ourselves for several hours at an affordable cost. There are varying packages for all budgets!\n\nWe go to play, and spend hours here. It’s easy to do when it’s affordable…and my favorite is being able to bring food/drinks for my tribe. They come in clutch though with snacks and drinks on site if you don’t bring your own.\n\nThey host classes regularly to take part in, and have even invested in therapy groups on site.  Regardless of ability…. Your child will have an absolute blast here!\n\nBut wait…. There’s MORE!  They sell annual passes. You won’t regret visiting!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Diana Paiz-Morris\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I just celebrated my son’s birthday party and we all loved it!! It’s fun, safe, and the staff treats you like family. You can tell they love what they do and love bringing smiles to our little ones and us as well because seeing our kids so happy, makes us all happy. I got so many compliments from the moms about the great venue and how it catered to all ages, needs and interests. There was thought and loved put into all the different play areas for sure! I just can’t say enough about how amazing it was thanks to Lindsay and her amazing staff. Will for sure host another party there and take my little ones more often to play there. Hands down; easiest birthday party I have planned thanks to them who even decorated for me! Yeah, we all had an amazing experience!

We did the Super Duper package for our twins 1st birthday and it was incredible.

I can’t thank you guys enough!! The facility was so much fun and it really is for all ages! We had kids there ages 1-10 and EVERYONE talked about how much fun they had and how they can’t wait to go back!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sean j\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This is an awesome place for my son to play!

Everything was so easy as a mom throwing a party. I pulled up, walked a couple doors down and grabbed pizza, and had the party! Our children loved it and it didn’t t feel “overwhelming” like other play areas. I highly recommend for a low effort, efficient, fun party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Caetey Whitt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We love this place!

Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Merry Moody\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: I went with my grandchildren and they had a fun time, indoor play places are a wonderful option for good or rainy days! However; I was concerned about safety. Everything was very cluttered, and chaotic, too much crowded into areas and toys and blocks strewn everywhere. I did appreciate that the support beams in the swing area were covered with pool noodles for safety, but there were other spots that with all the clutter a child could easily fall and knock their head on. My recommendation is add more pool noodles to pad additional areas, and equally important have an additional staff member that can monitor and maintain the toys and equipment, to keep them in their designated areas, the one staff member that was there remained at the desk the entire day to manage incoming customers. Also reduce the amount of toys and blocks.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: El Z\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sadie14\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Amazing spot for littles!

It is like our home away from home on Wednesdays. We can kick back on the oversized pillows talking and catching up, or sit and play blocks or play tag and hide and seek. My grandson is always excited to see Lindsey and to make new friends. He always has a hug for Lindsey before he leaves as well. We cannot recommend Capabilities Play for All Abilities enough and we are thankful for getting to know Lindsey and Corey!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tiesha Berry\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We had our son’s 3rd birthday party here yesterday and every single detail was perfect. All we had to do was pick the theme and they handled the rest. Lyndsey, who is the owner, was very responsive and pleasant. Taylor, the manager/ face painter, was extremely helpful and nice. She also did amazing with the face paint! The kids loved it. This was my husband’s first time planning a party and with their help he looked like a pro. Everything went very smoothly and this is coming from someone who had never stepped foot in the establishment prior to the party. It’s is also kept very clean. I would highly recommend for a kids party or even just a normal play date!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ali W\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We went today for the first time and we will 100% be coming back! We arrived around 3:45 and for the first hour we were there, there was only one other kid there which was so nice for my little sensory guy! My son is 3 (has cerebral palsy) and my daughter is almost 6 (typical development) and they both had a blast! There were plenty of things for both of them to do! I really appreciate the padding on almost everything my son tried to get (he’s wobbly) because he could just crawl around freely and I didn’t have to worry he would bonk his head. My son’s favorite things were the bubble wall and hanging spaghetti type lights and my daughter’s favorites were the crash pads and play hamsters (haha)! We would love another location closer to us (in beavercreek). We don’t have anything like this and I think it would be a great success but until then, we are happy to make the drive for the inclusiveness of this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Cantrell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: We love capabilities! It’s a great safe place for my toddler to play. They switch up some of the toys too so she never gets bored. They also hold events regularly that are always a hit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shanda Adams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Thank you Shanda!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellen Blanco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: We had an amazing experience here for my son’s first birthday!

I understand these businesses are difficult. But to consistently stare down parents, and their kids, and be hostile when you feel the kids aren’t playing “correctly” is sad. I get the impression this is a business ran by two people who don’t love kids. I don’t enjoy coming here, but had high hopes that ultimately were let down. My son pushed the shopping cart out of the grocery area, and into the ball pit, the owner came rushing over, took the shopping cart from my son, and made a huge deal. I’ve seen it done to other kids as well. This is not a welcoming place. It is not a safe place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Meghan DiMario\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Capabilities is a fun, safe environment for kids of MANY ages! My son loves it there. We always feel welcome and safe to play and be ourselves.

I reccomend to all parents that they need to take their kids there to play. The owners are such caring and sweet people!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jim Meeks\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I cannot say enough about this business so I’ll simply say it’s FANTASTIC!!!!! My 3 grandchildren ages 3,6,10 absolutely beg to play here. I don’t mind driving over an hour weekly to allow them to play especially when it’s all day play and we can bring in food and drinks. We have met the owner and the assistant manager and they both were so accommodating, very polite to the kids and were consistently making sure the play space was clean and equipment was in tip top shape. I would and will recommend this place to everyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Capabilities is my new favorite playground to bring little ones! So many different things to do, from the toddler soft play and swings, to the big kid swings and playhouse with all kinds of food!! I absolutely love the sensory area for kids that need it! It’s super clean and fun place to be at!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: brandon powell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place to let kids run around!

The staff is super nice!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Wendy Everett\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Employee threw a MAJOR tantrum because a 20 month old child threw a foam block in the ball pit. She started throwing and kicking objects to the proper \"zone\"  and yelling at parents and children,  these objects included the hard Lego blocks where some kids were close by. Yelled at parents for playing with their children. Her behavior was unacceptable! Would never recommend this place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tayler Eversole\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: INCLUSIVE FOR ALL, indoor playground.\nThe playground, and the facilities are very clean, with full size changing tables that could accommodate an adult if needed!!

My grandson has been to 2 events and loved them. We did Easter bunny and super heroes.  He’s very hyperactive and runs to all the play things but has so much fun.  Being enclosed I don’t worry bout him running into a dangerous area like the parking lot. He loves it so much and price is so reasonable. Everyone can afford to give their child several hrs of fun and smiles\n\nMy newest great grandson is less than a year but could enjoy the play area as well\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: DaRhonda Brown\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lauren Stabler\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We LOVE this place.

Please please please open a Beavercreek location!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James Maass\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thanks James!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amy Mantravadi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Our autistic son loves this place! It is a little quieter than other play centers and has a wide variety of activities. The bathroom and changing facilities include adult sized tables for bigger kids who need diaper changes. Different sensory options can be explored. Also great for neurotypical children. The $50 summer membership is a tremendous deal.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Nally\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Went for the first time today and my 3yr old absolutely loved it!

Dollhouse, dress up costumes, train sets, several playhouses and tons of ride on cars. Big plus for allowing outside food/ snacks to keep the kids happy for hours before getting hangry!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ebru Cetin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Clean, fun playground for the littles. The socks are only $2 and most snacks are $1. They don’t charge extra for multiple parents.

It’s annoying to watch parents let their kids destroy things intentionally and barely say a word to them. I feel for the front desk who did ask the kids to stop even though it’s the parents responsibility to keep their kid in check and not just ignore what’s happening.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sunny Hills\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This is a very toddler-friendly place, so if you have a child under 5, it’s a great option. However, it may not be as engaging for older kids. Since my son is 1, I find it better suited for us compared to other places. Another big advantage is that they have workstations for parents, with desks and chairs, which is fantastic. I can sometimes get work done while keeping an eye on my child playing nearby. The space is also not too large, making it easier to keep track of my kid because I can spot him quickly. Another perk I appreciate is that they allow outside food and drinks, so I can easily feed my son during playtime.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaydee Zhao\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ana Reclosado\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: It’s a okay place for toddlers\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tom Van Steenkiste\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Super clean place, not sure how pricing stakes up as we were there for a special event.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louven LaHuillier\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: A good sized playplace for my little ones and I can easily see them play about.

While they did have fun, I dont think we'll be returning. Nothing seemed very clean, lots of damaged or broken toys, and toys not in their correct place (and not being returned to their home by staff in the 2 hours we were there.) The poor girl at the front seemed to be alone, handling everything. I get it, she can only do so much. With that, there were also issues of enforcing rules. There were kids eating in the play area, running, taking off socks, and a child almost leaving the building, which I, personally, had to stop and console him while trying to keep track of my own kids. If the price was half as much as Kangamoo, Wally Wombats, or Kids Town I could see past all these things but for the same price, we'll drive a little farther to go someplace that is more kept up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Ho\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chaelin Kwon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We just had our kid's 2nd birthday here.

She really loved the play house and the ride ons, the Thomas Train and all the toys as well as the bigger equipment. Great size venue to be able to keep an eye on your child from a distance and know they are safe. Really clean too. Would definitely recommend and return soon!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nhi Nguyen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Took the kiddos here and it was awesome!

Easy to see your kids while they play as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: divinelyfavored\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Today we visited Wigglin’ Out Indoor Playground LV and the girls had a great time!\n\nIf I find a play area that allows them to play while I can sit and decompress, it's always a win. I would say that this play area is great for kids 6 and under based on the size of the toys and space inside of the play area. Bring your own socks, or you can purchase them for only $2/pair. Very clean as well. Friendly staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Both my kids (ages 1 & 4) love Wigglin out! We have been coming here for years.\n\nWigglin Out is a smaller indoor playground, geared towards younger kids, which I love, because some of the bigger playgrounds are overwhelming for toddlers. The facility is locally owned, spotlessly clean, and the owners/staff are so kind.\n\nWigglin Out is also one of the most reasonably priced indoor playgrounds in Vegas, and they run great specials and host fun events. This is definitely one of our favorite spots for the whole family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R David\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We were in Vegas for a week (end of August) and attended this facility about 4-5 times. We had a fantastic experience. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Most importantly, the facility is more intimate and not as loud/hectic as other indoor playgrounds.\n\nThere are plenty of different toys for children to experience. We really valued that the size was more intimate (it made our children less distracted and not as over stimulated as the louder, super bright/neon/flashy places) but most importantly, this Wigglin' Out is OPEN EARLIER than all the other places.\n\nThe earlier open hours were key because most children are up early so to have to wait until 11 am to start burning off energy is too close to lunch/nap times. Now keep in mind, we were visiting from Canada so I recognize that earlier weekday hours may not be as important for locals.\n\nBut for us, as tourists, this venue was excellent: wonderful customer service, more calm/intimate setting, and better opening hours.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blaine Jasmin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We always have a great time when we come here. The place is always clean especially the bathrooms which is my pet peeve. The staff is always nice and welcoming.

It's 12 dollars per visit, but you can get the punching card for 85 dollars, which is good for 10 visits. There are lots of toys to keep the little ones intertained and also a small area for snack.

Chris, the owner, is great with all of the families that enter into the facility. We are all like family in his eyes. He keeps the center clean and organized. The children have a wonderful time and enjoy playing with each other. It is a perfect place to take my toddler as well as take a break and watch her play. I am a first time parent. Finding places that are made just for her is a little bit hard. This place has ample space for the children to explore yet small enough for me to keep my eyes on my little one, while sitting down. I continue to come became my little one loves it so much. It's were she gets her wiggles out. Thank you Chris for always being wonderful to my family. We truly appreciate it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Roger Nitti\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I twisted balloons for a birthday party very nice place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: karla miranda\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My son enjoys coming here 😁😁 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charlene K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is awesome!

Overall, it was a good experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey McCallum\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This place is great. I’ve been bringing my daughter since she was 11 months old. They have a young toddler section that is somewhat blocked off and you can safely trap your baby in there. Now that my daughter is 20 months she has so much fun running around, jumping, sliding and playing in the ball pit.\nThis place is a lot cleaner than other indoor playgrounds and I like that it’s not too big so I can keep my eye on her but also give her some space to play.\nThey have comfy couches for parents and an eating area so the kids can enjoy their snacks. The other great thing is you don’t pay by the hour so you can really let your kids burn off all their energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Okay indoor playground but if you have younger kids I would avoid. There are too many older kids (8 or 9 years) playing way too rough around the younger kids, including one who kicked my one year old daughter in the face on purpose.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A CP\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: My daughter loves coming here.

Cheaper then anywhere else I’ve seen. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: My son loves it here. Lots to keep busy. Can get crowded but still plenty of space to find something to do. I like that I can follow my son around wherever he goes, since he’s under 2. Clean play area and clean snack/sitting area for the parents. We’ve been back twice now and I plan on purchasing the 10 passes for $85 or the monthly plan. It wasn’t posted anywhere that you had to pay 3 months upfront for the monthly plan (which was $60 or $65 per month, I believe) so heads up on that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Jensen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Donna Peterson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Roxana Dela Cruz\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: The best indoor playground.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruba Naddaf\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R PRuley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Took my nieces and nephew here and they had such an awesome time!

He was very excited to see other children. So this mom complained to the front desk about my child instead of making a connection with me and maybe get our children play together. Like cmon my child is still a baby and I’m doing my best to teach him the right way and it’s not like every parent is perfect, we all make mistakes when educating our children. The front desk person was telling me to supervise my child better and tell him the right way to behave. I’m trying to do my mom job and I have a very active baby and I get tired too. I was told in a rude manner as though saying we are not welcomed back. Especially the other mom was a regular customer. I could become a regular Cust too. I need my money back please\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: owln williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Great place. Reserved for our daughters 3rd b-day party.

Take your child to Billy Beez in Crystal Run or the Castle Fun Center where they actually have clean facilities and you don’t have to worry if your kid will get sick from playing on the equipment.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danielle Conigliaro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: We had our daughter’s 2nd birthday here this afternoon and everyone loved it! The kids at our party ranged from 1yo-10yo and they had plenty of entertainment in the play gym. Our teenagers and adults played games in the party room. There was truly enough to keep everyone entertained without coming off as overwhelming or overstimulating. Even some of our adults joined in the ball pit fun! Both rooms are kept tidy and clean and the staff is beyond phenomenal! They helped us with anything and everything needed to make our party a success. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making our princess’ birthday extra special! We cannot wait to come back and play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elena Scander\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Oceans playhouse is such a neighborhood treasure! It’s pristine, beautifully themed, and such a wonderful place for creative, imaginative, active play.\nOur kids loved it! They spent hours playing and making friends, practicing teamwork, and really having a blast. It has great obstacle courses and aims to please all age categories. Even the teeniest 💕🥰.\nThe staff is so sweet and even interacted and played with the kids. Clearly they love what they do and it showed from the service to the details of this play area.\n\nHighly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lilo Pinpin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: Such a beautiful place run by a very kind and outgoing person.

I gave it 3 stars because my toddler refused to go into the balls so she sat near me and I did not pay for her but later my son threw balls to her and she threw it back inside so they asked me to pay for her play time. I feel it is too pricey. I was there an hour with 2 kids, one who barely touched a few balls and it was $40. Otherwise this place is wonderful! The staff is super nice and they gave prizes to my kids when I left.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leiby M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: tara v\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Today was our first time at this place and it was AWESOME!

The room next door where they set up the tables and food was very spacious for everyone, and was set up very nicely. They offered board games to the teens to play if they wanted to do their own thing. It was an amazing setting if you’re not looking for anything overwhelming and where you are able to keep an eye on your children while they wear themselves out for a great nap! lol! The staff is super nice and accommodating! I am very happy I chose this place to have his party at!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: simcha\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I visited this kids' fun place and had a fantastic experience.

I decided on this place because of the soothing colors and good reviews.\nMy one year old had the best time of her life. This place is adorable with its ocean theme. The blue and white balls, and many stuffed ocean animals. It's way nicer than the other indoor play areas that are overwhelmingly brightly colored.\nGreat for very little ones. (and for bigger little ones!)\nReasonably priced and nice staff.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Em Bee\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: A very nice small playhouse for little kids, they have a big ball pit where to play, swings in the back and a nice climbing area with three stories high, the kids had a good climbing experience. Three slides together to get down and a closed slides for a little more thrill. Very friendly staff. Socks is required so if you anyway plan to where them make sure you have otherwise you will have to pay $4 per pair.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yidel Brach\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Perfect place,\nChildren had a great time b\"h\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yolanda Reddy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I came here for my granddaughter's first birthday gathering. From the time we walked in till the time we left the owner of the place was very hospitable and kind telling us about why she started oceans playhouse. She expressed her love for kids and that this was part of her life in China these types of playhouses. The place is very clean, they have a safe place for babies to play, and is very reasonable in price! Although it was for the kids us adults was in there having fun too throwing balls and playing tag! I definitely recommend this place for anyone who has children around the ages of 2 to 8 it is very fun and great exercise at the same time for your youngins.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Valerie Raymond\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alexx Cabrera\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Pretty expensive for 2 hours with nothing included but still a great place for the kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evan Coles\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Great place!

My daughter loves going and the owner is super super nice like comically nice. Only wish there was a little more room for the parents to hang out as there is only a few chairs available but all the space is used for the kids so its understandable. 5/5 we go there almost weekly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Koreena Gamble\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: It's so clean staff is friendly very age appropriate for toddlers and SAFE !!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Alex DuPre\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: This is a nice - smaller environment indoor playground with two great slides, a good two level play cage with fun tunnels and climbing nets. It also boasts a large pool like soft ball pit that the cage and slides are placed. They also have sit on bounce balls around the perimeter and other toys. There is also a small pool covered in clear thick plastic like a water bed for the 2 and under crowed. It has seaweed like plastic toys and other items to give an ocean like experience.. There are a couple of activities that require assistance from adults for some 3yr olds.\n\nThe owners also have a banquet like space for parties next door to the playground which is very convenient.\n\nIn my two visits it was not busy. My daughter had fun and was not overwhelmed. We even randomly met one of our friends there.\n\nMy only complaint is that we were charged twice for our visit but this was quickly rectified.\n\nI must add that the double charge issue was one of misunderstanding. It was an batch posting of credit charges. Two separate visits were received and posted to my account on the same day. It appeared as a double billing when in fact it was two separate visits. The owner was very prompt and courteous in researching what had happened!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kelly Carroll\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I just have to say this is such a hidden gem for moms with younger kids! First off, it is super clean(the employees are constantly running around making sure that everything’s in order). The employees are so geared to your children having a great time.

The kids had crazy amounts of fun and the adults were enjoying not being bothered as the staff helped whenever she saw a child struggling anywhere. Some of the kids started out scared, but she helped us encourage them and told us how to guide them. It was the first time for all the kids to experience such a huge ball pit and tall slides. The rope bridge to the trampoline was ultra cool. They used the space under the structure really well. We took turns going to the nearby Dice Bowl for some tasty drinks and the kids never noticed. A sign of a great play place.\n\nWe didn't buy any snacks, but it's a decent selection with slightly higher prices, nothing crazy. I really appreciated the bathroom setup with a changing table and wipes in both single bathrooms as my 2 year old decided that was the best time to go #2. The bathroom was very clean, as was all of the facility. The shoes off policy is a great idea.\n\nWe're definitely coming back as the kids really enjoyed their time here. We were there for a party, and as far as I can tell, the price was reasonable and certainly well worth it. The normal entry prices seem standard for this type of place. A good time was had by all (including the adults, I also enjoyed swimming in the ball pit).\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Simon Jacobs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Best place to go, the lady at the front desk actually helped the kids getting on the sliders and was very friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Personal Assistant\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David de Guzman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lonny Rosenfeld\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Please be careful when booking a party with this company. We booked a party for my daughter and had to cancel due to Covid. We were never issued a refund even though the party was cancelled according to their refund policies. They then lied to the credit card company when I disputed the charge saying they issued a “store credit”.\n\nI would recommend staying away from this company, especially if booking a birthday party.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melissa Sims\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: This was such an awesome place to bring my toddlers! Super clean and so much fun to climb and explore. The woman working there was also very gracious and often quietly came alongside to assist kiddos if she saw they were having a hard time climbing or just to ply with them. There is an age restriction of 8 years old to climb up to the second and third levels, so parents can’t accompany past a certain point.This might be helpful for parents to know ahead of time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chloe Anderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: This place is awesome!

Perfect for children to spend time here.

The woman didn’t let us in. She only allowed him to play in the ball pit, which is nothing fun at all. She said someone older needs to take him in. My cousin is 11 years old and the woman said she is too big. I begged that my cousin won’t play, will only go supervise my son as they requested. But we still got rejection. I understand if my son needs to be watched. But by what age person? How come 11 is too old to go in supervise? Not to mention on their Facebook, admission fee is one kid plus one guardian. What does guardian mean ?\n\nShe didn’t let us in only because she is a discriminating person. My son was crying and they don’t have any sympathy. Please don’t come here, don’t support business like this!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Peng Hou\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Worst playhouse EVER! Very rude staff.

With ball pits, slides, and climbing areas there is enough to entertain the little ones for a couple of hours.\n\nThe play space is clean and seems solidly built. A selection of snacks and bottled water are good for a light snack.\n\nI haven't seen a party here but it seems a great size for private events up to 20 or so kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jojo L\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Thank you for the review!}",

The first strike was that they charge for parents to sit and watch the kids. Fine, it's poor customer relations but it's their business to run. Strike two is if you want to go in to watch you must buy their socks even just to sit and watch. When I protested I was told that was their policy and I didn't have to stay if I didn't like it. I didn't and didn't. That was strike three. This is not a business I want to support and I ask that you don't either.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Stark\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 weeks ago\nReview: Our son really liked this place\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Molly\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: I always enjoy going here with my nephew and we usually spend a few hours, the staff is super friendly and the food isn't half bad either!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Aaron Flowers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Nice little place that you can pay once for all day, unlike the expensive pay by the hour places.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dominique Wilmore\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: My daughter loves this place.

I will recommend go on week days if you don't like busy time because it can get super crowded.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: B\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a month ago\nReview: I have been here multiple times, and I almost booked a birthday party here one year.. but we were in the area so I had decided to play here last Sunday. But we couldn’t even get inside. And after I found out what happened, I will NEVER return.\nThe parking lot had at least 30 cops, and I asked one grandma, as She was being shuffled out of the building, what happened? This is as the police were taping off the parking lot area, and eventually, the front door after hurrying several other people out of there. She told me, “go, get out of here! There was gunfire! Go!” I will absolutely not return after that, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut despite that incident… I would still give this place 1 star because they never keep anything clean. We used to come here a lot, but we had stopped and went to different indoor playgrounds because nearly every time that we would come here, within the next 2-3 days, my kid was sick. And he would end up with an ear infection as a result, and it was really bad. It was at least three separate times that we came to LOL and my son was sick a couple days after.\nMy son was only 2 then, and I was at home with him all the time.. he couldn’t have got sick from anywhere but here as he was not in daycare, and we really didn’t leave the house very much at all, therefore I know that it had to have been at LOL that he got sick. Kids will be running around coughing and sneezing and still playing and touching everything. If your kid is sick you should not bring them out to a place like this, obviously, but soo many people do it anyways! So rude.\n\nThe staff could have done temperate checks during cold/flu season? Or if they saw an obviously sick child, ask the family to leave and sanitize the area? But you don’t see the staff ever cleaning anything here. The tables are a mess a lot of the time, the play area is worse. They only walk around with a leaf blower to “clean” up the ballpit balls that have gone astray. Never seen anyone wipe anything down.\nYou can tell they don’t really care to clean much of the many surfaces because obvious shoe marks, dirt, etc. all over the play area and floor. The ball pit balls feel disgusting and greasy. It’s the worst on the high levels of the play area. I’ve climbed to the very top which is very high up and that’s where it looks the dirtiest, probably because it’s not as accessible as the ground floor and most parents aren’t up there to notice. But why are there dirty shoe marks when it is a “socks only” facility anyways?!\n\nIt is too bad the staff/owner don’t really care, because this place would be great if I was just judging the playground equipment! Unfortunately, they allow in what I feel like is more than their capacity should be, and the place is flooded with kids running left and right, no staff supervision anywhere at all, and they don’t clean a thing afterwards.\nThe owners obviously don’t care to change their policies and improve this place as I’ve seen numerous other reviews that were recently posted.\nOverall they lack sanitation for a children’s facility and we saw the aftermath of an extremely dangerous hazard in a children’s play place… so thankful we weren’t inside when this occurred and I hope everyone was okay.\nI hope they get shut down after this incident, it is so not ok for this to have been happening at a place for kids. If they stay open I think they should install metal detectors & hire a decent cleaning crew to sanitize this place.\nWill never return ever. I already avoided coming here when my kid would ask, instead I’d suggest a different indoor playground, but now it will be a hard no.\nI wouldn’t have even came here today in the first place, but we happened to be nearby on that side of town, so I said fine we will go.\nBut driving there, I kept telling my son, don’t put your hands in your mouth or on your face, unless you want to get sick!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Scuba Steve\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Great place for the kids, good choice of food and snacks. I really wish they run the AC a bit cooler in this place though, those kids be coming out looking like they came from the pool... I get they are running around but the amount of bodies the room gets warm fast. Especially its summer now with 100+ degrees outside inside should be cool. As a parent just sitting in the dining area its warm..\n\nThis place is one of the better bigger indoor play area in the southwest.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelique Garcia\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: American first Investment group\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: My kids live going here.

The staff members are always nice, the food is good and we have a good time. I have been to every indoor play place in Las Vegas and they are very strict on a no shoe policy for sanitary purposes. For those that like to complain go to the park and let the flies get on you after they have been eating dog shit then on your food in the summer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Thiago Recinos\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A R\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place is a huge safety hazard for kids. There are plastic balls everywhere, many of them cracked and no staff in the playing area at all to monitor. Extremely dirty due to zero maintenance. On top of that the girl at check in was so unprofessional - charged me extra and when I mentioned it after I looked at the rates, she just rolled her eyes and said I should have told her before making payment and that she can’t do anything now. Was unbelievable and so apalling! When I asked if there is someone else I can talk to, she just said there isn’t any supervisor/manager. No apology and zero people’s skills.  She either hated her job or was just a bad person.\nI had my kids with me so I went in even though I didn’t want to. I called their customer service line the same night and I was assured the manager will call me in the morning but no one called and it’s been almost a month now.\nHence I am writing this review as it is clear that the problem is not just employees but the business itself. I definitely am not returning and want to warn others as well.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carlos Herrera-Briones\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: this place is totally not worth it. machines don't work. and guy started the leaf blower at the end to kick everyone out. very rood people\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tammy Bohannon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Transformed Nichole\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: My children enjoyed themselves when they werent slipping on balls that were literally ALL over the place or getting balls thrown in their face by other peoples children who were not being supervised. This place has no safety percautions in place AT ALL. There are children of all ages big and small running at full speed around this small area with no regards to their surroundings even on the concrete where the seating area is located which is a major safety concern since everyone is in socks, I guess thats why you have to sign a waiver prior to entering this danger zone. There is no staff supervision, rule enforcement, limtiation on the number of people inside, no staff picking up the balls that are sacttered in the sitting area which is again all concrete. The food is over priced and definitely not worth it, nothing comes out as it is on the pictures. I ordered Juju nacho supreme wish i would have taken a pic for comparison before throwing them away. In the picture on the menu it shows beef on the nachos, it was given to me with chopped up chicken strips and  none of the toppings on the picture. There is no description of whats on anything just a name and a picture. Great concept for a play place but definitely needs some work!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Emily Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Etene L Taimalelagi\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Came here last Sunday 2/16/25 with my 2 grandchildren. I mean the kids had fun that’s the main thing.\n\nMy complaint was that the snack bar prices are way too high.  I ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches which had to be ordered as part of a combo meal. No alacart option.  And it came up to around $42.33.  This cost more than the admission for my two grandkids.  They didn’t have an option to pay in any other form except Zelle…I thought that was peculiar since the snack bar accepted debit/credit…\n\nBottom- line is that I don’t think we’ll be patronizing this establishment again.\n\nStaff-\nFront desk staff were apologetic about having to send a Zelle payment for admission.  For the most part type two gals were friendly and courteous.\n\nCafe staff.\n5/10 for service and value\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Villavicencio\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Beware. EVERYONE must remove shoes to enter. Yes even adults. Make sure you're wearing socks with grip on them for safety. Was invited to a birthday party and the floor in the room was very slippery. Many slips happened, including me. Yes you sign a waiver to enter. Now I see why. Fun place for kids, but this is just one big injury/lawsuit waiting to happen. Now imagine having to go into the public bathroom, in your socks. I did not want to try that.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charde Kelly\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I was extremely disappointed with our experience at LOL Kids Club in Las Vegas. It’s supposed to be a fun and inclusive place for children, but unfortunately, we experienced clear discrimination during our visit. The staff treated us unfairly compared to other guests, and when we brought up our concerns, they were dismissive and unhelpful. No family should have to deal with this kind of treatment, especially in a place meant for kids to feel safe and welcome. I will not be returning, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately.\n\nThe Arabic man who says he is the manager is horrible. Looked my two 6 year olds and 1 year old in the face and told them he wasn’t letting them in and they were not going to play today.  Do not bring your children. Children do not deserve this verbal abuse.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Karrianna Siv\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: If this place can get a 0 rating, it would have been given quickly! This was my first and it will certainly be my last. They expects you to take your shoes off as soon as you get in but their restroom is filthy! I ordered food and found hair in my food. When I addressed it to the lady in the kitchen she didn’t apologize or offer anything else. She just stated “okay” and walked away… Save your money, time, and energy for a place where it not only be cleaned/sanitized but who can be kind! Kindness goes a long way!!\n\nOriginally, I rated a 1 star ⭐️ However, I brought it up to a 3. I believe it was the manager that came back and refunded me for my onion rings that had hair in it. I appreciate the effort to try and make things right. That’s an honorable thing he did and I thank him for coming to speak with me and asked if there was anything else he can do for me.\n\nWhile I felt like the situation was handled inappropriately. I would like to send my sincere apology to the young woman who walked away. I’m learning that people have different responding mechanisms. But want to extend my thank you for bringing it up to management attention to help make things right.\n\nBut please, clean your restrooms and floors. Help keep our community healthy.\n\nThanks!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Randy Johnson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Arto M\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Staff is very rude and disrespectful. I and my wife went there with our 2 kids and ask additional box for shoes and jackets because all staff wasn't fit in one. Answer shocked me - \"one box per family\". Can u imagine? Plastic box for shoes is very limited in this place.\nAnd be aware for entry rate. 2 parents with 2 kids in a single payment transaction is more expensive then 2 separate charges (1adult+1child). They rip you off if you dont pay your attention.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Gianna Griffin\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: My daughter recently hosted my twin granddaughter's birthday party at LOL Kids, and unfortunately, I can’t recommend this place. My daughter paid $1600 for their Ultimate Package, which included 3 rooms, food (8 large pizzas, 2 appetizer platters, 2 salad platters), unlimited drinks, and icee treats for the kids. While the price was hefty, we expected great service and a smooth experience for such a special occasion – but that wasn’t the case.\n\nIssues we faced:\n1.\tShoes Policy Problems: Upon arrival, we were told all adults had to remove their shoes. This included elders and people with health issues who would be sitting the entire time. We had to argue with staff to get waivers to allow our elderly family members to keep their shoes on, which should have been handled more gracefully.\n\n2.\tRoom Mix-Up: To our surprise, when we got to our reserved rooms, they were given away to another party. We spent nearly 45 minutes sorting this out, and the issue wasn’t resolved until we spoke with the owner. The excuse they gave was that they thought we were part of another party, but no one bothered to confirm anything. It was very frustrating, and we didn’t even get into our rooms until an hour after the scheduled party time. As compensation for the inconvenience, the owner gave us a frozen tiramisu cake and two fruit trays – hardly an adequate fix.\n\n3.\tPoor Food and Service: The service at the party was subpar. The host was unprofessional, and we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks and inquire about the food. We were given random food substitutions, like ranch dressing instead of the Caesar dressing we ordered. When we asked the staff about it, they acted like they didn’t know what we were talking about, and one of the workers at the register admitted they had just run out of the correct dressing. Additionally, we had to keep asking for plates, cups, and basic items, which seemed to annoy the host.\n\nFor the amount of money we paid, we expected much better service and attention to detail. The staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in providing a positive experience.\nFinal Thoughts: If you’re planning to book a party for your children here, be prepared for potential stress and poor service. The lack of professionalism, mix-ups with reservations, and inattentiveness from the staff made this a frustrating and disappointing experience. For the price, there are certainly better venues that will respect your time, money, and your child’s special day.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Olga Kukuk\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Benjamin “nonprofithow” Everhart\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: Go here!

Both kids and grown ups could play. Food was pretty good. Definitely worth the price. UNFORTUNATELY, at the bottom of the big red slide in the ball pit I found my 2 year old daughter playing with this knife. Thankfully it was closed, but I can't even imagine if it was open and my kid or another slid down onto it. Ended up getting sidetracked with my kid running away and forgot to mention it to a worker, I wish I did. Anyway, I feel that they should have someone regularly checking the ball pits and play areas for things like this. It makes sense that ANYTHING can fall out of ANYONES pockets here, it should be regularly checked. Place was fun, a bit run down, but finding the knife definitely was not. 2/5 stars for that reason.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rose Cherry Anderson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Johnny Reyes\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: Place is a total scam now.

Typically the kids last 2-3 hours so plan accordingly\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mama_ KT_\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I never thought I'd leave a review wishing for a zero or negative star option, but here we are. I've been to this children's play place more than once, and my previous experience was disappointing due to the cleanliness of the play area and the staff's attitude. We let a Groupon expire because I didn’t want to return. But after my daughter kept asking to go for the last two weeks, I figured we’d give it another shot, hoping it had improved. Unfortunately, it’s worse than ever.\n\nWe visited on Saturday, 8/24/24, meeting friends for a playdate when the place opened. After letting the kids (both 5 years old) settle in, we sat down, periodically checking on them. The floors in the seating areas were filthy, covered in shoe and sock prints, and this was right after opening. Then, my daughter came over and told me she stepped on glass. Shocked, I asked her to show me where. Meanwhile, her friend showed her mom a small injury she had gotten while trying to avoid the glass, causing her to fall and land on the glass, which ripped her new leggings and cut her knee, making it bleed.\n\nI walked over and saw glass scattered everywhere near the front windows. Another parent mentioned that their child had found the rock that had clearly broken the window. When my friend asked for a bandaid and the staff saw her daughter's bleeding leg, they told her it had already been cleaned up. I then informed them that was definitely not the case; glass was still all over the mats. This is a play place where kids are required to wear socks only. One child was already bleeding, and that was the staff’s response? A few of us parents started using toys to barricade off the area because the glass had spread over a large area. There was no urgency from the staff; they eventually came over with brooms and said, \"It's not our fault people keep breaking our windows.\" True, it’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to maintain a safe environment for the kids.\n\nDespite our concerns, the girls wanted to keep playing, so we kept them away from that area. The staff’s cleaning efforts were inadequate—they didn’t even bother to get a vacuum to clean up the shards of glass on the mats. They removed our barricades. It wasn’t until the owner arrived later that the staff finally brought out a shop vac and sealed the window to clean up the glass properly. Yet, the owner never checked in with my friend to see how her daughter was doing.\n\nWhen our kids got hungry, we ordered food: one large pizza and an order of chicken spring rolls. The food took a long time to arrive. When I bit into the spring rolls, I found a triangular piece of bone inside the chopped chicken. I took multiple pictures as proof. Then I noticed a rash on my friend’s daughter, which hadn’t been there before. That was the last straw; we decided it was time to go.\n\nThis place is a disaster—the staff is terrible, and there’s zero regulation on older kids roughhousing. An older boy, maybe 8-10 years old, was grabbing my daughter’s hands in the ball pit, and I had to intervene calmly. No parents were in sight.\n\nWhen you go to a play place, there’s an expectation of cleanliness, kindness, and safety—this place has none of those. To top it off, only one sink in the women’s bathroom worked, the paper towel dispenser handle was broken, one toilet was out of order, and another was clogged. The toys, like the large Legos and the balls, were filthy, and even my daughter mentioned that the slides were dirty.\n\nWe had to explain to our girls that we were leaving because it wasn’t safe—between the broken glass, the bone in my food, and the rash, it was time to go and never come back. I’ve mentioned this experience to other mom friends, and they all had horrible things to say about this place. I have no idea how this place is still open; it needs to be shut down.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Martika Elliott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: It's a cool experience for me and my son\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ruslan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Menakhi K Henu Jay\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: The main thing that matters is that my boy had a great time.

Byeee 👋🏽 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sabrina Marie\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: This place is RIDICULOUS! 1. They are very intrusive and want to collect all of your personal information. Who knows where they are selling it.\n2. They charge for grandparents & handicap people who are not there to play. They force elderly and handicap people to buy socks and tickets when they just want to sit and watch their grandkids play.\n3. OVER priced for the small space kids have to play. The kids get bored with such limited things to do.\n\nNo 👎🏻 thanks. They will be out of business soon.\n\nGo to a trampoline park. It's a much better value and kids will have more to do. Plus you won't get knocked over the head with charges just to watch your own kids....\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan Calderon\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I had heard so much about this place and was excited to take my granddaughter.  I won’t go again.\nIt is obviously not well maintained at all.  Dirty, and SO many games broken but not marked as such.  Dropped a lot of coins that got us nothing.  Adult pricing seems excessive and to have to buy their socks - though I was sitting at a table the whole time seemed foolish.\nTheir listing should boldly state their shoes/ socks policy.\nTheir house keeping needs a royal step up and their employees need to learn some manners.  Disappointing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Nicholson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Nice\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Crysta Leena Patricio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vira Vorobiova\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tom Van Steenkiste\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Second adult per kid you have to pay for is kind of a bummer but other than that a really nice place.

Admission is reasonable. Cashier in the front didn’t give us wrist bands so that made leaving confusing. Food was pricey but decent, took almost an hour before we got our food and partially due to them not properly putting phone number in for text notification. Kids had a lot of fun though. I feel like there should be staff walking through checking on kids cause it is a big area and to try to keep balls in their areas as it is a tripping hazard. This area is so big you can lose a kiddo and if they don’t actually check wristbands/neglect to give them then I feel this could be a major safety hazard. I do like that you have unlimited play time though unlike other places we have gone to.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucy Deng\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids have so much fun in here！\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kailani Benavides\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: everything is good but the pizza is very expensive and bad\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Guenther\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: Great place and your kids will love it.

Came here with my son my sister and nephew on Memorial Day the man that checked us in gave me a really hard time because we wanted to pay separately instead of together to avoid the additional $7.95 charge for an adult. He made me put my son’s water cup in the dirty shoe bin because water was “not allowed.” Upon entering I noticed water canteens on almost every table so I went back and brought this to his attention where he then gave me my son’s water cup back. Very strange. I’m 7 months pregnant and wanted to take my son to do something fun and in turn I come here just to feel super stressed out and uncomfortable by a grumpy employee. Super disappointing. Bathrooms are completely disgusting as well, brown on the walls in the stall. So it seems that the staff was concerned with my son’s water bottle than anything else! There’s a Wally Wombats not far from this place, way cleaner and friendly customer service.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jesus Lopez\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I can’t comment on their playground because I didn’t get inside. My issue was with their policy on charging adults. I arrived with friends, each accompanied by their own child. When we were asked if we came together, I said yes and offered to pay for everyone, expecting my friends to reimburse me later. Despite each adult having their own child and us all signing waivers, they insisted on charging me for four adults simply because we arrived as a group. I questioned why we had to pay extra when they weren’t providing any additional care for our kids. They replied it was their policy for group arrivals. Frustrated, I requested a refund and went to Kangamoo at Sunset instead.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anny Smyth\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nima Lhaden\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sophia Marielle\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: employees gave so much attitude i didn't like their energy\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kimberly Breen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I would like to express my appreciation for the professional and courteous service provided by the front desk staff, particularly the young man who was also observed diligently vacuuming the kitchen.

The place is large with a good layout.\n\nThe negatives - The posted food menu did not match what the cashier was ringing up and she could not change it to match without being up charged.  Waited 45 minutes for a quesadilla and chicken sandwich.  The bathroom was disgusting and we arrived near opening so it was not restocked from the night before or cleaned.  Leaking toilets while wearing socks, there are sandals but no sign if for public use so was unsure who's they were.  The machines for the kids to use in the play area were broken or lacking power to where the balls would not shoot out or power up.  The games seemed expensive, $1 for 2 tokens.\n\nOverall I'd say it was ok.  If they maintained the broken items and cleaned better it would be a five star.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: USN MAA\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This place is a terrible place.

It's a very large play place, and sometimes, when it's too busy, the little ones get hurt/run over by older kids. All the kids, for the most part, appeared to be under 6 when I was there.  The jungle gym is big enough that a parent is able to climb through it as well. Seemed pretty clean, didn't go to the restrooms which I hate because you're in socks only. They have some arcade games, but after spending $18 to get in, it can get expensive playing games. The birthday space I wasn't impressed with simply because it's all linked together in one large room.  Just rows of tables, maybe 10 - 15, so you don't have a personal space. You're behind glass separated from the general public, but not from anyone else having a birthday party at the same time. There's plenty of seating available for parents while the kids play, and the snack bar has a nice variety of items. Pricing wise they're high, but it's a play place so I expected it. It was almost $7 for a small slurpee (6 or 8oz I believe) and bottle of water.  The air guns in the playpen weren't working and there are several of them. Looked like no one had checked them to see because balls were stuck in them that weren't intended for the guns. I wasn't able to pull them out, and even guns that had nothing stuck in them weren't working either. Overall, my daughter enjoyed herself so I'd definitely go back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mariah Zaste\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids always have a blast the food is mid but the kids love it and I love the massaging chairs\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark G\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jennifer Banks\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Used to love this place years ago...it's went downhill since...not the cleanest at all.

I’m sick of attending birthday parties at play places/trampoline parks that are so overwhelming and overstimulating. This space is set up more like a fun daycare/classroom and was absolutely perfect. It had something for every child.\n\nThe kids felt empowered/comfortable enough to explore and find things to play with. Coloring, arts & crafts, play kitchens, cars, dinosaurs, dress up, Duplo Lego, bowling set, a calming/darker corner, and a bounce castle with ball pit. SO MUCH TO DO! But none of it was loud or overwhelming.\n\nThere was light music playing and even a gentle water feature with live plants. Seriously so calm and sweet. There were plenty of tables to set up food, refreshments, gifts, etc. - nice blank spaces to decorate and make our own. The restrooms were clean and prepped for kid use with step stools and faucet extenders.\n\nRuna could not have been lovelier. She was so sweet and made booking totally seamless. I would recommend this place to anyone. It was nice to support a local business too! We will be back next year! ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: We love YUZU, Miss Runa is so great with the kids & the creativity of the experiments...my 4 year old LOVES coming here.

I specifically asked for an invoice that reflected my deposit, which they refused to provide. Despite my attempts to communicate with the owners for a clear breakdown of the payments, they canceled my party, claiming the payment wasn’t made.

Parking was very easy and plentiful and it's centrally located.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Grace Pamu\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Thank you so much Grace! It means so much as a small business!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Susan H\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Unfortunately we had a really awful experience at Yuzu and Space, and I don't recommend booking a birthday party here. I hosted my daughter's birthday party here after speaking with the owner, Rhuna extensively beforehand she promised activities like painting  and making friendship bracelets. Unfortunately, neither of these activities took place. The owner (again Rhuna), who was extemely friendly when we arrived, disappeared into a back office and barely interacted with us.\n\nThe party was supposed to last a total of three hours, but I cut it short by over an hour because of the owner's behavior. After two hours or so of hiding in the back, she emerged extremely angry because the kids had made a mess. These were small children 2-4 year olds without any guidance or structured activities, which she had promised to provide. Instead of getting defensive I apologized and I tried to help clean up, but her negative energy made everyone feel unwelcome. She was scowling and giving off a horrible vibe and I became worried she would cause a scene.\n\nI had also purchased a piñata with her approval to schedule that at the end of the party, but we didn't get to use it because we had cut the party short. Rhuna became very aggressive towards my husband, and I was so embarrassed in front of our guests that I left to wait in the car. I didn't want my daughter to know anything was wrong, so I didn't want to complain in front of her or have her realize we were leaving early. My husband paid the full amount and we just asked our guests to leave without much explanation because they all realized she was making a problem.\n\nTo make matters worse the owner later posted on social media, complaining about us. She never communicated any expectations of parents or asked us to do something different beforehand. Instead, she hid in her office and suddenly came out without warning, seemingly perturbed.\n\nWe were told we would have a fun birthday party with painting and bracelet crafts, and I assumed there would be helpers to set this up and guide the kids. Despite the lack of promised activities, I didn't complain because I just wanted the kids to have fun and they were having a good time. I hope the owner can learn to communicate and plan better, but we certainly won't be back. I have been to many birthday parties for friends kids and planned my kid's at many locations and never once was anyone treated this way. My intention was to support a new local business and try out a new place but it turned into an unfortunate and embarrassing fiasco.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tanya Buckner\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you so much!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miranda Olea\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Yuzu & Space is such a fun place to take your littles! There’s a variety of different activities for kids to do and it caters to a wide range of ages. There were plenty of soft areas for my baby to sit and play safely. The facility was clean and the owner was so sweet! We look forward to going back again soon.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Erik Morton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We love this place, we do the monthly membership and end up here at least once a week. Our 5 year old totally loves it there. The owner is the sweetest and loves to play with the kids. It is still your responsibility to watch over and clean up after your child. It’s great place to go if you have little ones that aren’t in school yet but need something fun for them to do while the older ones are in school Or somewhere to escape our  weather. The seating and tables, along with the sensory area and crafts are switched up pretty regularly. So it feels new and different every time we visit. It’s a great small business that we love to support. I’m sure any young family would love it as much as we do.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jillian K\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Adorable indoor play center that is perfect for 2-5 year olds. The owner is so kind and caring, and she has all the Montessori and holiday themed projects you see on social media but rarely end up doing at home. My daughter is three and we stayed for well over an hour rotating through all the fun areas, but she could have stayed much longer. Everything is very well thought out, and there is just enough to keep kids busy but not feel overwhelmed by too much stuff. They also do parties, which I think would be awesome for this age range. We will be back for sure!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louie S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Absolutely loved this place for my 3yo. She spent 2 hours moving from activity to activity and even then didn’t want to leave. I love the decor, the calming atmosphere, chilled music, wonderful vibe and so many fun little things for the children to explore and enjoy. It’s bright and spacious, everything is new and clean. The owner is really lovely too and it’s clear when you walk in that she has put a lot of love and passion in to that place. We can’t wait to come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yvonne Kai Anderson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Thank you so much for your support!!

However, it may not be as engaging for older kids. Since my son is 1, I find it better suited for us compared to other places. Another big advantage is that they have workstations for parents, with desks and chairs, which is fantastic. I can sometimes get work done while keeping an eye on my child playing nearby. The space is also not too large, making it easier to keep track of my kid because I can spot him quickly. Another perk I appreciate is that they allow outside food and drinks, so I can easily feed my son during playtime.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kaydee Zhao\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ana Reclosado\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: It’s a okay place for toddlers\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tom Van Steenkiste\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Super clean place, not sure how pricing stakes up as we were there for a special event.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louven LaHuillier\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 10 months ago\nReview: A good sized playplace for my little ones and I can easily see them play about.

While they did have fun, I dont think we'll be returning. Nothing seemed very clean, lots of damaged or broken toys, and toys not in their correct place (and not being returned to their home by staff in the 2 hours we were there.) The poor girl at the front seemed to be alone, handling everything. I get it, she can only do so much. With that, there were also issues of enforcing rules. There were kids eating in the play area, running, taking off socks, and a child almost leaving the building, which I, personally, had to stop and console him while trying to keep track of my own kids. If the price was half as much as Kangamoo, Wally Wombats, or Kids Town I could see past all these things but for the same price, we'll drive a little farther to go someplace that is more kept up.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: John Ho\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chaelin Kwon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We just had our kid's 2nd birthday here.

We have been coming here for years.\n\nWigglin Out is a smaller indoor playground, geared towards younger kids, which I love, because some of the bigger playgrounds are overwhelming for toddlers. The facility is locally owned, spotlessly clean, and the owners/staff are so kind.\n\nWigglin Out is also one of the most reasonably priced indoor playgrounds in Vegas, and they run great specials and host fun events. This is definitely one of our favorite spots for the whole family.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: R David\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We were in Vegas for a week (end of August) and attended this facility about 4-5 times. We had a fantastic experience. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Most importantly, the facility is more intimate and not as loud/hectic as other indoor playgrounds.\n\nThere are plenty of different toys for children to experience. We really valued that the size was more intimate (it made our children less distracted and not as over stimulated as the louder, super bright/neon/flashy places) but most importantly, this Wigglin' Out is OPEN EARLIER than all the other places.\n\nThe earlier open hours were key because most children are up early so to have to wait until 11 am to start burning off energy is too close to lunch/nap times. Now keep in mind, we were visiting from Canada so I recognize that earlier weekday hours may not be as important for locals.\n\nBut for us, as tourists, this venue was excellent: wonderful customer service, more calm/intimate setting, and better opening hours.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Blaine Jasmin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We always have a great time when we come here.

He was very excited to see other children. So this mom complained to the front desk about my child instead of making a connection with me and maybe get our children play together. Like cmon my child is still a baby and I’m doing my best to teach him the right way and it’s not like every parent is perfect, we all make mistakes when educating our children. The front desk person was telling me to supervise my child better and tell him the right way to behave. I’m trying to do my mom job and I have a very active baby and I get tired too. I was told in a rude manner as though saying we are not welcomed back. Especially the other mom was a regular customer. I could become a regular Cust too. I need my money back please\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: owln williams\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Great place. Reserved for our daughters 3rd b-day party.

And so did I! This particular place is GREAT for smaller children since there are a lot of toys geared towards to the \"younger than 5\" age group.  Staff was very nice and inviting and the establishment was very clean. I figured the restroom would be \"questionable\" and even that was very clean. Overall a great experience and I'm sure my daughter and I will visit frequently.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lucy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: LOVE THIS PLACE!

If we pay for two hours, trying to play all the games in that timeline is not feasible. I bought unlimited drinks for my team, and the bartenders were extremely slow and rude, it was almost because we had a drink band they were less interested in serving us and preferred to give more attention to patrons buying single drinks at a time. You had great games that were often broken, so we had to come back to play. It would be a more enjoyable  experience with a few tweaks the major one being the amount of people. Maybe do colored bands based on time so they can have security moving people to the bar areas to either eat or drink only so that new waves of people can try the games??? The other thing that was not enjoyable was the sales process. The rep Deborah farmer was rude, unhelpful and seemed annoyed with any questions. When we showed up the door staff was rude and kept asking me \"regular or VIP\"- to which I replied \"its a corporate event\", they didn't offer assistance or information they kept repeating \"regular or VIP\", like a mocking bird. It was horrible. I will continue to deter people from this place. clearly you only cater to tourists and have zero interest in local customers.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julian Smith\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Epic}",

I hadn't been in a few years, and took my three kids last week. The employees do a good job of keeping everything picked up and clean on the surface... But this place needs a deep cleaning BAD! The entire playground area had a faint smell of urine, and everything has a layer of grime on it. I was really iffy about letting my one year old climb on things, and sure enough he ended up sick. Half the stuff was broken (one of the trampolines, the zipline, etc), BUT, my kids still had a blast. In all honesty though, I'll probably just choose a different playground next time that I know is very clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Sissons\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 months ago\nReview: This place is amazing!

I will definitely be coming back here every time I am in Las Vegas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evora Evoraa\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This playground has honestly been the worst experience for my daughter . My daughter has gotten sick here multiple times , they aren’t very sanitary , I’ve been missing months for it to be better but nope workers sitting on their bum selfs on their phones not cleaning play area at all some how it gets dirtier each day it’s a socks only howww ? yes I understand it’s a playground for children but it’s also very hazardous , there’s a lot of broken things , broken steps and a window where my daughter was about to fall from . There’s been so many concerns for me , children aggressively pushing my daughter , calling her stupid , mothers fighting amongst each other , the staff works for nothing and doesn’t ever intervene . I’ve escalated my concerns with the owner and she has shown no interest whatsoever, instead of providing solutions for her playground she just says her workers aren’t police officers ? She has also mentioned that she plans on not having any maintenance done to the playground not even within a year as she also made it known that she was the cheapest and best in town and actually planned on raising her prices , you can’t even express your concerns to the workers because you get strikes as a customer ? She has also just said other places are better than hers while giving the excuse of her playground being old ? Half of the place is torn down lady. Overall such an awful option , I originally opted towards this playground because of how conveniently close it was to my house but I will be resorting to anything and everything else for the best experience for my daughter . I had the year membership and gave these issues time to be resolved and they just worsened . I recommend Wally Wombats , it’s only $5 more for the annual membership and it’s an overall better alternative . Good Luck to kangamoo\n\nPhoto credits to Mealexc S.

Centrally located and easy to access, it’s filled with exciting activities geared toward younger children. The playground is very clean and well-maintained, which immediately put us at ease as the kids explored the slides, climbing structures, and interactive areas. They enjoyed every minute, darting from one play zone to the next with endless energy. The welcoming environment and thoughtful setup made this a delightful outing for everyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christopher Walter\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: 14 bucks for each child for 3 hours.

Every play area is pretty much in one large area where you can keep a good eye on the kids . The employees were really nice and helpful 👏🏽.  I will certainly be back to this facility soon .

My one year old was crying desperately and I was just trying to feed him with ONE GRAPE to calm him, but immediately they told me that outside food wasn’t allowed inside (only their junk food of course). They couldn’t wait for the baby to calm down. Also, this employee was always speaking on the speakers telling kids what not to do. Very annoying. If in spaces for kids there’s no compassion and kindness, where are we supposed to go?\nIt’s a nice structure though, and I bet with different management it would be a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joshua Segal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 11 months ago\nReview: Great idea, location, friendliness of staff, and affordable.

This place is a life saver for us and our restless 21 month old! It’s located just 10 minutes off the strip and next to the airport.\n\nThings we loved:\n-PLENTY of toys and a great variety too\n-An extensive play gym\n-Several trampolines\n-Kid friendly restrooms that were easily accessible\n-plenty of seating for parents following their little ones around the play gym\n-Two massage chairs for parents\n-An elliptical\n-Food available for purchase\n-Cubbies and lockers\n\nOur son didn’t have socks but thankfully we were able to purchase them on site.\n\nOur son had so much fun here.

Poor food selections, everything is dirty, I mean my daughter's hands were black from climbing up the playground..just gross and not worth the money at all.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tanya Gomez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Awesome for the kids very good prices!!!

I have an 8-year-old and 22-month-old. There was something for both of them! We stayed for over 2 hours, and neither one was bored the whole time. There is a bigger kids section and a little kids section. The employees were friendly, helpful, and engaging! They even played with my little guy, and he had so much fun. Throughout our visit, I kept seeing employees constantly cleaning and disinfecting toys and common areas. I highly recommend this place, and my older boy is already asking to go back before we leave!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Wyll Lauded\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The kids have fun all the time.

Most of the time have children in them as well and it went from $10to $14 per child I've since been to many other places and see there's better but it's still ok for people who it works for and that's why I still give 4stars\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David (QuasiDave)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great indoor play area for kids.

Don't Bring Your Little Kids Here!\nI brought my 3 year old here today and it's full of adults barreling down the slides head-first (without kids) and teenagers bullying little kids on the trampoline. The big kids - far too old to be there were boisterous and dangerous, pushing little ones over. It isn't a place for little kids.\n\nNot to mention there were FAR too many people in there - clearly part-time parents and their family members. There should be limits to two adults per kid.\nThere was a 350lb man up on the climbing frame net area making the whole thing creak and shake and the useless TEEN staff (clearly management doesn't want to pay adults!) couldn't manage anything. It is a matter of time until that comes down on someone's head.\n\nThe whole place is a disaster and danger to children. There should be an upper age restriction on how old kids can be to enter - it's not a place for the over 10s and this was being exploited because of the useless management.\n\nThe running around of a 5-year-old does not have the same momentum as a ten-year-old running around, ploughing into little ones. Again, the little mouse voices from 'management' did nothing and the trash parents were more interested in their phones than watching their kids. Upon entry, they should be spoken to about watching their kids, not to let them bully and over tens should be turned away.\n\nAlso, their toxic stamp takes 60 years to remove and will make my kid's arm red in the bathtub, trying to get it off.\n\nAvoid. At all costs. It's a matter of time until a kid is really hurt - or worse at this clown show and they get sued into oblivion regardless of their stupid waiver or signs, that no one reads.\nIf I could rate it minus stars, I would.\nWe will never be back and we'll be telling other parents to avoid the place too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sarah Shafer\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Fix your parents area.

So I went back on December 20th and to my disappointment, the two attendants who are in the courtyard were exclusively looking after a single child and that same child wanted me to take my daughter out of Jump so she could feel comfortable. obviously I didn't take it away, it's a collective space. Then these two attendants went down the slide with that same child. They were taking exclusive care of her and in the end they even made a balloon flower, ignoring all the children who were in the space. Then my daughter chose a snack, but I was without my wallet waiting for my husband to arrive in 10 minutes and the attendant was super rude saying that I couldn't open the snack package without first having to pay $1. My daughter is autistic and was very upset by the situation. If I paid $14 why wouldn't I pay $1. and he was still mocking. I will not return to this place again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaime Monroy\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Patricia Shelton\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Grandson's third birthday party it was awesome all kids all ages very happy\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veronica Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We went here for a 3 year old birthday party and we were beyond impressed.

For today Nov. 11th. At the time of booking I was told IF more than 15 kids showed I would be charged for the 22 child count party. OK not a problem.\n\nI was also told we would get 2 full hours in the party room.\n\nWhen I arrived today I was CHARGED for the 22 child party as soon as I walk through the door. They did not even wait for the head count. Then also asked for a TIP. Right as we arrived.\n\nThe employees could have cared less about helping us set up the party!!!\n\nThe \"party host\" with the party was virtually none existent. We did basically everything ourselves from set up to clean up!\n\nWhen the party was about over we were told to vacate the party room before the party for even over. BEFORE the 2 hour mark! The hostess finally showed up and said we could stay additional time for another $50.00.\n\nWhen I went to the cashier she number 1 refused to give us out money back because it was a 15 child party not 22.\n\nSecondly, she refused to give us an additional few mintues in the party room that the hostess communicated we could pay for.\n\nNOT one person was kind or courteous. There was very poor communication. We were for lack of better terms over charged for the party head count.\n\nNot a family friendly or good customer service experience at all.\n\nWhen I asked to speak with a manager I was told I had to wait until Monday and call them.\n\nDespite Kangamoos extremely poor customer service. We tipped the one person who did check on us well.\n\nNeedless to say, unless this very Bad experience is addressed.  NONE of us at the party plan to visit this establishment again in the future.\n\nDear manager. Call Me! Signed an overcharged patron!\n\nI will gladly update this review IF management contacts me to corrext this wrong and experience. B Because they will deserve a kudos for effort. I have to wait until Monday to talk with anyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C S\nRating: 1/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: I purchased a punch pass for a Christmas gift and had my purse stolen and therefore the punch pass. They refuse to give me a new pass (and you can clearly tell the pass has never been used) or refund the $95 spent on it. I was shrugged at and told they’ve had people have their whole cars stolen and won’t replace it. We will not be back and will not support a place that operates like this. What’s the point of having us sign a log book upon purchase of the pass if you can’t track it? I’m a Nanny that has been here with lots of kids here and we will not be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: A C\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Helena Donker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for parents  and kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: quantumous\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Just like childhood.

This is a fun place to bring your kids! But everything is coated with a brown grime of dirt and is pretty gross. Just make sure kids wash their hands after! There was also a man named Mr. Michael, I’m not sure if he was part of a group or was one of the workers, but he was very unkindly yelling at children and putting them in time out! I was horrified that he was treating the children the way he was! He made quite the scene as kids sat there on the bench and he reprimanded them.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Katie Copeland\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: This is the absolute dirtiest place I’ve ever been to in my life.

Thank you!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leo Hayakawa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Clean and seems like a safe environment.

My daughter and I hadn't been able to come in awhile so it was the first time we came after the remodel. We stood around and waited to get helped at the front door for over 5 minutes. The person who worked there walked around the corner on his phone and couldn't even act bothered by the fact that we stood their. I'm not gonna lie I almost just let my little one(16 months old) go and play. We were so excited to see what they had changed with the toddler room and it looked so good! I only wish that my little one could actually enjoy it and not get ran over by the older kid that wasn't suppose to be in there... definitely loved the remodel and I'm hoping to come back but it's going to be a minute... definitely sad that it was ruined by the employees lack of care...\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sydney Paschal\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Great place to let you kiddo of any age play and run and make new friends.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devin H\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lenka Skalska\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Baby Trin\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: It is wild but the kids sure do enjoy it and it's not super expensive like some places and there's an uncountable amount of things for the kids to get creative with\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan Rowe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stuart McNeill\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 9 months ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lisa Simmons\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Sure would be nice if they updated their google hours if they're closing for long periods of time for construction.

It takes less than 2 mins to update google hours so people don't waste their time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lindsey LeCheminant\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I have to give 5 stars for the staff alone. We had a mix up on our party date (I showed up a day earlier than they had on their schedule) and they didn’t even hesitate to jump into action and accommodate us. I know this wouldn’t always be possible, but they were able to make it happen and literally saved the day. Everyone was kind and warm and so helpful!! Thank you so, so much to the staff for being incredible! Additionally, the facility is clean and the playground is a blast for kids while parents can watch from a safe distance. Everyone from my 18 month old (LOVE the toddler area) to my 8 year old had a great time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelley Phipps\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: I was able to relax and let my 2yo grand daughter run it all out. 2 hour car ride to get there so we stopped,play, then get the shopping done.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sue E\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 months ago\nReview: Great place for kids to burn off excess energy.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lea Briggs\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We always love coming here.

Only down side was the interaction we had with 1 employee. Long story short we went upstairs to sit down after being cramped in one of the downstairs room for a hour. I asked the young lady if the private parties were over and she told me yes, they ended at 330. So we grabbed all our stuff and headed upstairs. About 30 minutes later, my partner had someone very politely come up to her and explain more parties were coming and that we need to go downstairs, she complied with no problem. My partner starts to tell me that we need to leave( I didn’t hear conversation ) but we are interrupted by the original employee who told me that the parties were over. She starts repeatedly telling us we can’t be upstairs, and asking if we were apart if a party. We told her no, that we are leaving. She repeats the same questions over again, with her voice raised louder, so finally I said I heard you the first 3 times, we are leaving. And that We paid 50 dollars to be here, we thought we could sit anywhere we like. She finally backs off and we quickly go downstairs. After we make it back downstairs, the original young lady who told us more parties are coming, comes up and apologies for the way her coworker talked to us. She felt so bad that she gave us free admission tickets too. To end this long story, maybe Planet Kid shouldn’t book 75% of the place up, and make the people not there for a party sit in a tiny room cramped together. Maybe just book the upstairs, and be very clear you can’t sit up there if you are not apart of a party. Shout out to the young lady who eased over the situation.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Nelson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Kids love playing here!

I took my niece there years ago and never was told about a waiver. Fast forward the employee yesterday never told me I had to sign anything.\nI went up with my son on the jungle gym. We went down the pink slide, he went first. When I went down my braid hooked on a screw that was lose from the top. It yanked a chunck of my hair out and my neck hurts today. I'm concerned about the future kids who go down this slide. They put a piece of duct tape on the screw even though the employee said it should have some padding on it also.\nCalled to talk to a manager today. She was extremely RUDE, explained it's on the list for the maintance person to fix but kids are still using this slide. She never said sorry for it happeneing but rather scolded me for not signing a waiver that was in a binder with a fuzzy pink pen that the employee never brought to my attention when I paid. We went round and round with that one. Ultimately with the manager saying it's the parent's responsibility.\nI don't recommend this place!!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Iris Udell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melanie Dunn\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had a party that we had to ask for a lot of accomodations.

We brought our daughter here when she was 2.5y and there wasn't a whole lot she could do, but as soon as she was bigger at 3-4y, she was climbing all over the place! We are very impressed with the level and amount of obstacles in this space. There's plenty of challenge here as well. Really great place to get that energy out and working on problem solving skills with how to get through the obstacles. Our daughter is very adventurous and has always had a wonderful time. Great snack bar too, plus nice seating area. Would be a great place for a small (~10 kids) birthday party!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dave Anderson\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Elizabeth Anderson\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Went for a birthday party and was pretty nice.

The first time it was a very busy Saturday and the 2 and under zone was filled with big kids that kept hurting him (mostly on accident) but I figured it was just a crazy busy day so we tried coming again on a calm weekday when it was almost empty. All the older kids were still in the 2 and under area. Employees don’t keep an eye on this area and parents don’t tell their kids not to come in. Usually the older kids are running around not looking and jumping in the ball pit. My one year old was trampled a couple of times. Very disappointed because he really was having so much fun but it’s just not a safe space, they need to control the 2 and under area.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawn Dammarell\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Crowded.

Makes me not want to come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: FES Handyman LLC Sadiki\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Cheap and fun. Just what people need in this crazy economy. The food though....not gonna lie kinda bad. The pretzels were frozen so when they thaw and bake they are like rubber, the cheese for them cost extra and it has no flavor, so if you ask me would I return for the kids to have fun hell yeah. Would I ever eat here again? Nope. I'd rather smuggle food in my purse then eat her again. Just not good at all.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Laura Iwersen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a year ago\nReview: We love it here great for little and bigger kids my son is 9 and begs to go 😁 …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Costen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place for a bday party.

My daughter has gotten sick here multiple times , they aren’t very sanitary , I’ve been missing months for it to be better but nope workers sitting on their bum selfs on their phones not cleaning play area at all some how it gets dirtier each day it’s a socks only howww ? yes I understand it’s a playground for children but it’s also very hazardous , there’s a lot of broken things , broken steps and a window where my daughter was about to fall from . There’s been so many concerns for me , children aggressively pushing my daughter , calling her stupid , mothers fighting amongst each other , the staff works for nothing and doesn’t ever intervene . I’ve escalated my concerns with the owner and she has shown no interest whatsoever, instead of providing solutions for her playground she just says her workers aren’t police officers ? She has also mentioned that she plans on not having any maintenance done to the playground not even within a year as she also made it known that she was the cheapest and best in town and actually planned on raising her prices , you can’t even express your concerns to the workers because you get strikes as a customer ? She has also just said other places are better than hers while giving the excuse of her playground being old ? Half of the place is torn down lady. Overall such an awful option , I originally opted towards this playground because of how conveniently close it was to my house but I will be resorting to anything and everything else for the best experience for my daughter . I had the year membership and gave these issues time to be resolved and they just worsened . I recommend Wally Wombats , it’s only $5 more for the annual membership and it’s an overall better alternative . Good Luck to kangamoo\n\nPhoto credits to Mealexc S.

I hadn't been in a few years, and took my three kids last week. The employees do a good job of keeping everything picked up and clean on the surface... But this place needs a deep cleaning BAD! The entire playground area had a faint smell of urine, and everything has a layer of grime on it. I was really iffy about letting my one year old climb on things, and sure enough he ended up sick. Half the stuff was broken (one of the trampolines, the zipline, etc), BUT, my kids still had a blast. In all honesty though, I'll probably just choose a different playground next time that I know is very clean.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jeff Hoyt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Wonderful staff and an excellent birthday party for my child.\nI can't state enough how smooth the experience was.\nDouble thumbs up for Kangamoo!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mark M\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: This place is great. Our two year old had so much fun. The message chairs they have for parents are worth the $10 for 3 hour price tag. I wish I lived in this state.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julie Samek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 years ago\nReview: This is an amazing place for you to play with your children indoors out of the heat! You can crawl around on the play structure with your kids or babies, push your kids in play cars, let them draw, or paint their nails! The place is designed for the adults too. It's $10 per kid, but the accompanying adults are free. You can sit in comfy chairs, work on your laptop with free WiFi, or go get a free massage in one of their 4 full body massage chairs! It was amazing! They also have free coffee, tea and water and areas to eat with your kids. My 1 year old had a blast crawling around and watching kids play everywhere. I had fun too and seriously enjoyed my massage! We're going to get a 10 punch pass the next time we go, which is $75, so we can visit regularly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Panouly Lo\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Our favorite place to take our kid to get some energy out, especially when it's hot.

The play stuff was fun but when we saw the signs for a weight limit it kinda made us feel like we couldn’t follow our toddler around as well. Overall it would be good for parents who needed to do paperwork and let their kids play while they worked\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ana M\nRating: 3/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I love this place but today i witnessed a full grown 6'0 210 pound woman come up to a little boy and yell at the top of her lungs while pointing at him because he wouldnt share a playhouse with her kids.

The kids loved it! We were so comfortable letting them play freely because we did book the room for the event towards closing time so the kids had the entire playground ground to themselves so it was PERFECT. I am definitely booking here again. Only thing that did bug me a bit was that we were told we would get help to set up and help throughout the event such as a reminder for time management for cake cutting etc. Yea we got none of that. Whenever we ran out of plates or napkins we had to go look for someone to get them & when we did get more we would get about 10 napkins at a time & a few plates at a time as well. So not much help at all. Which it is explained that you WILL have someone helping you but that's a lie.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shannon Burns\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: Attended a birthday party here two weeks ago and my child had a blast! Plenty of jungle gym for bigs but this is a hit spot for littles as there was A TON for them to do from dramatic play to physical. Fun literally around every corner.

I have an 8-year-old and 22-month-old. There was something for both of them! We stayed for over 2 hours, and neither one was bored the whole time. There is a bigger kids section and a little kids section. The employees were friendly, helpful, and engaging! They even played with my little guy, and he had so much fun. Throughout our visit, I kept seeing employees constantly cleaning and disinfecting toys and common areas. I highly recommend this place, and my older boy is already asking to go back before we leave!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Doug Hinman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: Another great place to escape the summer heat of Vegas and let your kids get out of the house. It's a bit out of the way but totally worth the drive. Big enough and varied enough to keep the kids busy but not so big you'll be worried or lose them. You can climb around with the kids or relax in the parent lounge. Your choice! Bring socks though you can't play without them. Even you as a parent need to wear socks!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Livio\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 years ago\nReview: Great Place! There are other places that might have a little more but they don't feel this good inside and they aren't involved with the kids as much. Everyone who works here is helpful and friendly.\nThey do story time, have special guests like paw patrol and trolls, there's so much to do the kids can't possibly get bored, healthy snacks and drinks, and they consider the parents better than ANY other place I've been. We will be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Bericbogan\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: Kangamoo Indoor Playground on Sunset Road in Las Vegas proved to be the perfect spot for a fun day with the little ones. Centrally located and easy to access, it’s filled with exciting activities geared toward younger children. The playground is very clean and well-maintained, which immediately put us at ease as the kids explored the slides, climbing structures, and interactive areas. They enjoyed every minute, darting from one play zone to the next with endless energy. The welcoming environment and thoughtful setup made this a delightful outing for everyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Walter Burek\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Place is awesome for kids and for parents to get a break.

My one year old was crying desperately and I was just trying to feed him with ONE GRAPE to calm him, but immediately they told me that outside food wasn’t allowed inside (only their junk food of course). They couldn’t wait for the baby to calm down. Also, this employee was always speaking on the speakers telling kids what not to do. Very annoying. If in spaces for kids there’s no compassion and kindness, where are we supposed to go?\nIt’s a nice structure though, and I bet with different management it would be a great place for kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anthm Wright\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: Toddler had fun!

Looked like it hadn't been sweep or sanitized. I let my 6month old stand on the toddler area in her white body suit and her feet where full of dust. There was trash everywhere and food crumbs. I also bought a toy since I didn't feel comfortable with my baby playing and trying to put stuff in her mouth and it was full of dust. I had to wash it. Staff were just standing around no one was cleaning. It was stinky! Kids weren't supervised.first and last time here! Not worth 10$. Mat floor was extremely dirty. Bathrooms were a mess. Massage chairs were damaged I sat in it for five minutes or so when I got up an exposed sharp metal got my leg. I saw a women sneezing into her hands and then touching the kids toys! 🤢 so gross I was freaking out I took my kids after my daughter saw the character which was the whole reason we went. I changed them in the car and washed their hands. Never again doing this terrible nasty place! I only got pictures on the way out I was to busy making sure my kiddos didn't pick up or touch anything in there. Also the grey couch had a throw pillow with stained with what looked like blood and something yellow.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: David (QuasiDave)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great indoor play area for kids.

Most of the time have children in them as well and it went from $10to $14 per child I've since been to many other places and see there's better but it's still ok for people who it works for and that's why I still give 4stars\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Edward C\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: DANGER! Don't Bring Your Little Kids Here!\nI brought my 3 year old here today and it's full of adults barreling down the slides head-first (without kids) and teenagers bullying little kids on the trampoline. The big kids - far too old to be there were boisterous and dangerous, pushing little ones over. It isn't a place for little kids.\n\nNot to mention there were FAR too many people in there - clearly part-time parents and their family members. There should be limits to two adults per kid.\nThere was a 350lb man up on the climbing frame net area making the whole thing creak and shake and the useless TEEN staff (clearly management doesn't want to pay adults!) couldn't manage anything. It is a matter of time until that comes down on someone's head.\n\nThe whole place is a disaster and danger to children. There should be an upper age restriction on how old kids can be to enter - it's not a place for the over 10s and this was being exploited because of the useless management.\n\nThe running around of a 5-year-old does not have the same momentum as a ten-year-old running around, ploughing into little ones. Again, the little mouse voices from 'management' did nothing and the trash parents were more interested in their phones than watching their kids. Upon entry, they should be spoken to about watching their kids, not to let them bully and over tens should be turned away.\n\nAlso, their toxic stamp takes 60 years to remove and will make my kid's arm red in the bathtub, trying to get it off.\n\nAvoid. At all costs. It's a matter of time until a kid is really hurt - or worse at this clown show and they get sued into oblivion regardless of their stupid waiver or signs, that no one reads.\nIf I could rate it minus stars, I would.\nWe will never be back and we'll be telling other parents to avoid the place too.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Veronica Davis\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We went here for a 3 year old birthday party and we were beyond impressed.

They put up with a lot to make sure everyone is comfortable and having a good time. Always friendly.\n\nMy only bad experience here was witnessing a parent falling asleep and ignoring their child. The child was hungry and ended up taking a bag of chips to her father and he didn't realized she just took them. This girl looked 5 years old and he started yelling at her. It made me very uncomfortable. Children need to be supervised by their parents here for a reason and he just wanted to sleep in the massage chair.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Julieth Araque\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: It is a beautiful place, where children can enjoy themselves and parents relax.

So I went back on December 20th and to my disappointment, the two attendants who are in the courtyard were exclusively looking after a single child and that same child wanted me to take my daughter out of Jump so she could feel comfortable. obviously I didn't take it away, it's a collective space. Then these two attendants went down the slide with that same child. They were taking exclusive care of her and in the end they even made a balloon flower, ignoring all the children who were in the space. Then my daughter chose a snack, but I was without my wallet waiting for my husband to arrive in 10 minutes and the attendant was super rude saying that I couldn't open the snack package without first having to pay $1. My daughter is autistic and was very upset by the situation. If I paid $14 why wouldn't I pay $1. and he was still mocking. I will not return to this place again.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Debra Hernandez\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Roughly $70 for 2 adults,  3 children and three personal loan pizzas. Not bad. My kids range from 1 to 11 and they all love this place. My only issue is that they are supposed to stamp everyone in your party this way the kids can't leave with the wrong family, however; my 1 year old 4 year old failed to get stamped. I walked past the counter where a worker should have stopped my son, but when I turned around he was standing right behind me and I didn't even know it. Long story short, make sure to watch your kids. They can skip away easily here. Otherwise, it's a pleasant experience.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mallory Huntley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: This has been a staple for my family for nearly a decade.  It is suited to 7 ish and under.  It is nearly all soft play with a little pretend play. It has a large seating area with FREE massage chairs.  They will make you eat outside food in a smaller room but that has never been a real issue. They also offer a lot of little snack foods at really reasonable prices so I often opt to just play the $7 and split a pizza.   It is a great place for play dates and I consistently have a punch card which is the best deal.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: C Y\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: My kids 2yrs old and 8 month old absolutely enjoyed themselves 💯 I think I just found a place to have their birthdays at☺️ They are very reasonable with pricing as well as there cafe area it's nice to know they also care for the parents, they have a treadmill and 2 massage chairs where u can relax while ur kids play!!! …\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Debi Good\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: We were in town visiting family and wanted a fun place to take our grandson (5 next week) for a few hours. After reading reviews we decided to try kangamoo. We were very happy with our choice. It's so nice to pay only for the child. They stamp each adult and child and check before leaving which is a nice safety measure. All staff were attentive and kind. I enjoyed watching staff interact and play with children throughout our visit. When redirecting kids they did so in a pleasant manner. I saw reviews complaining about snacks but we found that they had a variety which included some pretty healthy options at fair prices. It got busy at midday but most parents were supervising and our grandson enjoyed playing with the other kids. If we have opportunity we will definitely return. Restrooms were clean and we did enjoy each taking a turn in a massage chair while the other played.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jaimie Schaneman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: My son and I really enjoy this place so much.

There are several trucks, ride on toys, dress-up costumes, play houses, and other toys.

They have untrained employees, no managers on site and give out party contract details to anyone who asks even without permission from someone who booked the party.

When checking in, the parent and child get a matching stamp, when leaving, you must have matching stamp to leave with child.  They wouldn't let my son leave with their mom bc she didn't have the stamp and I needed to be present to show mine.  I really liked that and provided a nice since of security to know that a person couldn't walk off with a child.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Miguel Carrasco\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Took my daughter there while on vacation. Fee was $14 for my 4 year old daughter. They have passes for 10 visits and annual memberships available as well. It was a clean safe space that is kept at a cool temperature thankfully since it was 104 degree outside during my visit. They have a big window where you can see planes taking off from the airport but the insulation is so good you can hear a thing. There are 4 massage chairs for weary parents that my wife and I gladly took advantage off and thankfully use was included in the price. Along with many seating options for adults who need somewhere to plug in or a couch to just sit down and take a breather. The actual play area was very spacious with 2 trampolines, several slides, and many more nooks and crannies where adults can fit but kids enjoy climbing around in. All around I will definitely come here again as my daughter keeps asking for me to take her again. Just remember to wear socks and no saddles allowed!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Amber Swint\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: ***WARNING*** Worst Birthday Party experience ever......\n\nWe booked the party in Aug. For today Nov. 11th. At the time of booking I was told IF more than 15 kids showed I would be charged for the 22 child count party. OK not a problem.\n\nI was also told we would get 2 full hours in the party room.\n\nWhen I arrived today I was CHARGED for the 22 child party as soon as I walk through the door. They did not even wait for the head count. Then also asked for a TIP. Right as we arrived.\n\nThe employees could have cared less about helping us set up the party!!!\n\nThe \"party host\" with the party was virtually none existent. We did basically everything ourselves from set up to clean up!\n\nWhen the party was about over we were told to vacate the party room before the party for even over. BEFORE the 2 hour mark! The hostess finally showed up and said we could stay additional time for another $50.00.\n\nWhen I went to the cashier she number 1 refused to give us out money back because it was a 15 child party not 22.\n\nSecondly, she refused to give us an additional few mintues in the party room that the hostess communicated we could pay for.\n\nNOT one person was kind or courteous. There was very poor communication. We were for lack of better terms over charged for the party head count.\n\nNot a family friendly or good customer service experience at all.\n\nWhen I asked to speak with a manager I was told I had to wait until Monday and call them.\n\nDespite Kangamoos extremely poor customer service. We tipped the one person who did check on us well.\n\nNeedless to say, unless this very Bad experience is addressed.  NONE of us at the party plan to visit this establishment again in the future.\n\nDear manager. Call Me! Signed an overcharged patron!\n\nI will gladly update this review IF management contacts me to corrext this wrong and experience. B Because they will deserve a kudos for effort. I have to wait until Monday to talk with anyone.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: D3Vii3 P\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: I took my 1 almost 2 year old here and we had a blast. Theres so many different obstacles. A place for the kids to color. They have snack and pizza for order. The staff is nice and the orange smocks really help them stand out. It a great place to go.\n\nUpdate: She's 5 now and still had just as much fun\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody Burch\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: We take our son here multiple times a week, if not every day. He absolutely loves it here, has made tons of friends, and has actually learned how to do and say things he never knew about before. My son is almost 2 years old, and I feel like Kangamoo has had an AMAZING impact upon his personality, his progress in learning the basics of absolutely everything, his social life, and his confidence. The employees are VERY nice- wonderful people, and I haven't met one that hasn't been awesome, and very helpful. Also, they offer 4 FREE massage chairs for the parents! They offer toys for sale for the kids, give free balloon animals, have people come by dressed up as their mascot, as well as other performers some times, and I've done my research- these guys have THE best prices in all of Vegas. Their year ticket is the way to go if you plan on coming back. Their playground is adaptable for children between the ages of under 1 year (crawling) and even up to 6 or even 7, maybe higher, depending upon the children's level of interest in playhouses, tunnels, slides, costumes, games, play cars, etc. Overall, I recommend them over any other indoor playground in all of Las Vegas.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Pure Living Nutrition\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: The place was fun for my kids, but my main concern was that even though the website says they close at 5:00 on Saturdays, the staff shut off the lights in the play area at 4:45, which is not safe for the kids! My kids were freaking out because they couldn't see me and didn't know what was going on! When I asked staff why they did that, they said it was to help get everyone out and to set up for a party. They said they made an announcement, but you can't hear announcements in there with all the kids! They shouldn't close before the stated time, and they certainly shouldn't turn off the lights on the kids!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christine Duh\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Kids had a great time, staff was doing a good job of making sure they sanitized everything after kids touched things\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kylee Rae\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: First time here in a Saturday. I watched a kid vomit and staff ignore it. I had to get paper towels to help the poor kid. When staff finally  noticed they were awful to his parents. Staff was rude to me when buying snacks for my child. Did not give me a receipt and acted like a was a bother. Will not be coming back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ronnie Long\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: If you have kids, you have to bring them here. It's really inexpensive and the design if the property is really intricate and immersive. The place is normally pretty packed with kids but it gives them a chance to get off the screens and play with other children in a safe controlled environment. You can rent out party rooms for large groups. There's snacks available to be purchased. And a whole section for adults to relax while the kids have fun. You really can't go wrong.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Mike Atkins\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 6 years ago\nReview: Updated Review\nThis place is still amazing. We came back 2 years after our original review. They have since added many new things to keep the place relevant and exciting. We have also added one to our family since our last visit. She is 1 and had an absolute blast climbing, sliding, and playing with toys. This place really is great!\n\nOriginal Review\nOk, this is the best place to go with kids. The playground is huge and they made it so you can play with your kids! I'm 6'4\" and 215 pounds and I was able to navigate it with my 2 year old just fine. While my daughter played with the kitchen set, I sat in the massage chair for 20 minutes. The same type that you would pay 10 bucks at the mall, is complimentary for parents. Then, I enjoyed some free coffee and my daughter did crafts. After 3 hours, my daughter was nice and tired! For ten bucks, you couldn't ask for more!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Space\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: Really fun! Meant for kids under 10, but I had fun at 15! The playground is big enough for adults and kids alike to play. It costs $10 for kids 10 and  under 10 to play for 3 hours (but no one checks so you can really play as long as you want) and everyone 11+ and under 12 months is free. There's the regular indoor climbing area, which is pretty huge. A bunch of tiny play houses, massage chairs, and an area for kids 3 and under. (My 2 year old brother was playing in the regular playground as well though) Lots of fun and really cheap! Strongly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: brylle estrada\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The smaller white girl is not kind of welcoming. Kids are kids and often commit mistakes. She even don't smile and just stayed on the counter all the time. They're not accommodating unlike the black girl and her partner that has shift on Monday 9/25.\n\nPlace is good but people are not. 🫥\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Samantha Brandt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited 3 years ago\nReview: Very fun for the kids! Enough seating and area for parents to hang out. Free massage chairs for the adults make the place even better ;) Workers keep the place very clean but it's not their job to keep an eye on your children, so please, make sure your children are following the rules and being nice and respectful to the space and other children.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dick Jones\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 years ago\nReview: Out of all the play centers we've been to in Vegas this one is by far the best. The staff are extremely friendly and organized. I love how hands on the staff is with the kids. There is a nice lounge area for parents to sit in. It doesn't feel chaotic compared to other places. I just wish we lived closer.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anthony Taylor\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: We had our sons birthday party here. He ended up hurting his leg because they didn't have a piece of metal in the jump area properly protected. It ended up ruining his party and he was so upset the entire time he didn't enjoy it. I hope eventually they pay better attention and make sure it's a safer place for little kids to play.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christopher Caldwell\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 years ago\nReview: This place is amazing! I let my 1 year old run around, jump off stuff and slide down things. She had a blast! The staff is friendly and helpful. They even have free lockers to keep your stuff safe, free coffee, free massage chairs and free water. Just in case you want something extra like ice cream or snacks, the have that at reasonable pricing.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Telu Ramos\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited 4 years ago\nReview: Workers are super friendly but of course...one was on his phone the whole time,  clueless to anything else.  Place needs some new dress up clothes which the kids all love to use but aren't able to.  They're advertising character visits on Thursdays but no one showed up...?   I had to pick up all the toys from the toddler area before mine could play without getting hurt.   We spend an extraordinary amount of money here with FOUR kids every year and want to keep coming back.  Vegas is open 100%  Let's go Kangamoo!  :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rositsa Petkova\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 years ago\nReview: Always very good experience! Amazing kids playground,clean and nice people working there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shaytoya Marie\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 2 years ago\nReview: I do not usually post negative Reviews but this location made me feel very unsafe as a parent with more than one child I was watching!! We went to this location September4 24th 2022 was super busy that day.\n\nI watched 2 of my children as they ran back & forth from the front of entrance. Plus breast feed my daughter so my hands were pretty full.\n\nI almost had an heart attack when I could not see my son any more after noticing that the side door was open from people having an event the only thing that blocks from the event is a sign.\n\nWhich to me is totally unsafe any child could walk out from the side since the staff isn't doing a great job with making sure that side gate is shut. Plus where the bathrooms are at it takes you to the same hallways with out having a door or gate. There should be a gate anyway's where events are hosted since kids go back & forth to the play ground.\n\nThe play area is too big to have the ability to see the kids once they go up & play so I would not know where my son had exited\n\nThank goodness my son was just in the slide.\n\nWhats the point of the gate in the front if a child or an adult that is not meant to be there can go through the side entrance of the parties or where the bathrooms are located.\n\nBut personally I would never ever come to this location ever again. Due to this reason I hope you guys take this into consideration & add a gate instead of just having a poster board blocking the entrance to the hallway.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ka'iulani Awa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 years ago\nReview: An excellent place for families to take their toddlers to burn off all that energy! The facilities and environment at Kangamoo created a fun and safe experience for my 2 year old who was constantly entertained by the variety of activities available to him. As a mom, I appreciated the clean, family-friendly restrooms, the pleasant staff, the complimentary beverages, and the healthy snacks for purchase. You can tell this place was designed by parents to meet the needs of families with little ones.  Wish we had a place like this in Hawaii! 100% recommend to anyone considering visiting.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Hardy\nRating: 4/5\nTime: Edited 2 years ago\nReview: Fun, but HOT! Thermostat said it was 78 and it was pretty stuffy & humid from all the kids running around. After 30 mins, my kids wanted to leave bc they were so hot. At least we could go outside for a second to cool off since the weather was cool. Even just as a sitting spectator, I felt it was pretty warm inside. When asked if they could adjust the thermostat, I just got a \"No\" reply. I know AC costs $$, but please consider keeping the place a bit cooler so the kids don't overheat!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angela Winward\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 years ago\nReview: My son loves this place and I get to have a massage while he plays in a safe and secure playground\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christian Mayo\nRating: 1/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We have enjoyed coming here, but will not return due to staff members being very rude and unprofessional. Need to hire better people who like working in the service industry and around kids. Lady who claimed to be a manager (not sure if she really was) was very rude to other customers and we witnessed her yelling at a lady who was just looking for the bathroom.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kathy Cumplido\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: My grandkids love me to bring them here, tons of fun. The facility is clean, and comfortable for the parents hanging out... There are even massaging lounge chairs! Snacks are available at reasonable prices with coffee,\ntea, n ice water available at no cost. The workers have always been pleasant and they really do watch that kids dont leave with anyone they did not come in with. At just $10 per child, i think this is a great place to bring the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah D\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 6 years ago\nReview: The play structure is very unique, not your typical McDonald’s play place. For $10 a kid (adults free) it’s a great price. They didn’t inform me on a time limit, we stayed for 4 hours! There was so much to do. I was worried my 6 year old would be bored of the more “baby-type” things, but they had a small zip line, trampolines, it was all very interesting.\n\nFrom what I saw, they were very careful checking hand stamps when leaving, so I felt safe enough to not have to panic every time I lost sight of her. Much better than say, Chuck E. Cheese.}",

As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Frankie Patetta\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I've had the pleasure of working with Bailey on a business level.

She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.\n\nThe space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.\n\nEven after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsey Flores\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This is such a great concept for parents wanting to have their littles near while we can get work done, I can’t wait to see Wonder & Unwind grow and even possibly into a bigger space (or maybe expand on the “parents” section) because if one is working or reading, the kids can still be pretty loud or present.

My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see.

While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.\n\nThey offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.\n\nI’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.\n\nI truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special.

All the toys and activities have purpose and I’m never worried about what my kids are playing with. I also love hanging out in the parent lounge. Such a relaxing place to be while my kids have a fun time.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Corinne Ball\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: My kids love this place… and I love having a tea or coffee while they play. So fun!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sierra\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: A wonderful facility to take your little ones. The staff is very kind and attentive to the children and the parents. It’s refreshing to be able to spend time in a safe environment with your children and get a few minutes to enjoy a coffee or tea to yourself with your kids in eye and earshot.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rebecca Perez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the 5-star rating, Rebecca! We're delighted to know you enjoyed your experience with us. Your support means a lot!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessica Parker\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wonder and Unwind is such a delightful place to take your littles!  It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.\n\nI wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.\n\nLastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S V\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place is good for infants and toddlers to spend some good time. It would have been better if the sqft would have been more. There is a place for parents to sit and have some food and do some personal work. I wish Bailey good luck.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nina Skubiak Ungers\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5-star rating, Nina!

We had my son's second birthday party and my daughters first birthday party here. Great fun for toddlers. Clean, safe, There’s a very big play area for a variety of ages, nice seating area for adults to relax or work. Snacks, coffees or tea are available for purchase at a very reasonable price. The staff is phenomenal!! I recommend this place to let the children get out and play!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ellen Cavendor\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for the 5-star rating, Ellen!

It's a beautiful, clean, and safe space for my kids to play and learn. The staff is wonderful and they do their best to monitor, conflict resolve with the kids, and of course play with the kids. Sometimes I can even sneak in an hour or two of focused work time, something that is very hard to replicate at home.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Presley Rabe\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: From the moment you walk in, you can tell how clean and well-maintained the entire space is.

They interact so well with the kids!\n\nIf you’re looking for a place where your kids can have a fantastic time while you get a chance to relax, Wonder and Unwind is a must-visit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Stephanie Vineyard\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I thought it was a cute little place. My 3 and 5 year old had fun.

My 2 yr old had a great time playing but I was afraid he was going to get run over by big kids a few times. This is pretty pricey so we only went the once. We would definitely go more if it was more reasonably priced.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Melody Leiva\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wonderful place to bring young children for indoor play. Very developmentally appropriate. I love that they have food options, coffee/tea for adults and healthy snack selections for kids. Very clean also.

It’s safe clean and overall a great experience for myself and the kids. I tend to play with my kids for a bit and then take a break in the lounge area with one of their house made tea lattes. It’s my go to place to give myself a break and get my kids energy out. Great for ages 6mo and up. They have a 2 and under room and 3 other rooms for the kids to explore. We’ve been coming here since 2021 and highly recommend.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Tatiana Scott\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I have been taking both of my boys to wonder and unwind since they first opened.

As a single mom of two who works full time and is in school Wonder and Unwind has been my lifeline and my sanity 🖤 I have found so many new mom friends and support here. I highly recommend to all with littles.

The staff is always warm and friendly, and they have the coolest activities in each room. The other neat thing I have not seen at any other playground type environment is caregiver staff that are nurturing and watching for safety issues. The other bonus is the cafe for great snacks, yummy drinks, and the parent WiFi to get something important done if needed. Thank you Bailey, this is something I wish they had in more places!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sara Flanders\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5-star rating, Sara!

It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun. I highly recommend!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Devyn Doty\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: I love this place! I get work done and my kids get to play in a safe environment!

There were older kids running through out the space, even in the smaller spaces designated as quiet areas. These kids took toys from one space to another even though they were told not to. They were very possessive and not willing to share the toys. 5 of these children left with one of the women who was working there.\nI was not impressed.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrea Fish\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: Every time my grandchildren go there, they get sick a day or 2 later.

I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oshun 4U\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 days ago\nReview: Very clean, staff were friendly and helpful.

ALL OF THE GAMES WORKED and the children really enjoyed themselves. I am so happy I booked with them. It's perfect a 4 year olds party. I highly highly recommend them!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: priscilla gomez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: Lucas and his staff are awesome!

Thanks Lucas!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: miho ogura\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 4 months ago\nReview: It was helpful because it was open until 8pm!\nIt is easy for small children to keep an eye on and play with it.\nThe staff is always there and the doors are locked, so you don't have to worry about people escaping, and the risk level is low, which is good.\nI feel like it's just the right size to play for about two hours.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Kyashi C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 months ago\nReview: Love it here.

We have tried many and none of them deliver the same as Kidstopia. Not to mention that they literally have the nicest management/owners. From the moment you enter, you feel like you’re part of their family/world.  Also, their facility is extremely clean, and so big and safe, it makes throwing birthdays and spending evenings or weekends here pretty magical for our kids😍😍\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lesly Pordes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We had our 3 year oldest birthday party at Kidstopia and we loved it. The place is very clean and has trampolines, swings, big wheels, slides, and other games for kids. There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linda Hang\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: If I can do no stars I would! They need to do better with their appointment dates! I booked an open play a month ago! A month! For Thanksgiving day. Nowhere on the website or when booking the open play says they will be closed for the holiday. The holiday wasn't blacked out either. So I THOUGHT they were going to be open since not everywhere is closed. Or they could had send me an email saying they were closed on that day and to reschedule I would of done it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leslie Aboud\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The owner was so nice. He kept the place clean and orderly for the children to move about freely.  He even gave me a pair of socks to have because I didn't have any. I will be going back for sure.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebrina\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: It was pretty cool except for the managers /person running the place on 10/29 in the morning son.\nMy 1 year old daugher went exploring into the bounce house and this 5 or 6 year old boy went inside it literally jumping on top of her stepping on her on purpose. We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.\nMy daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.\n\nOtherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shirley Furlong-Lim\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This place is clean and organized. The owner is very nice and friendly.

Positives: nice staff, clean bathrooms, not too busy. Negatives: you have to pay extra to use the arcade games and many of them didn't even work or were missing buttons. The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Princess Tolentino\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I rented this place for my daughter’s 1st bday.

The staff was very friendly and very attentive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris We\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dana Telfer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We had the best time at Kidstopia for my son's third birthday!

You will have to take your shoes off, which I think is great. The party room is so large. The kids really looked like they were having a blast! I plan to return with my grandson. Only negative is the parking lot is a bit small. Owners seemed very friendly too. Great place!!! 👍🏽👍🏽\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anthony Proano\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! The kids loved it!

We did the semi-private weekend party package and had about 50 people in our party alone but it was nice to also share the venue with the public. The party room is huge and has a private bathroom for your guests.\nThe party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here. Not to mention Lucas (owner) and his staff are very friendly and easy to work with\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sonji\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charisse Najarro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was a success.

Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Phillip Busche\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday there, was great.

And it did not disappoint. The play area is huge! There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shunran Zhang\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: Nice and clean place to go with kids, feels like they want to stay here foever❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniella Silverstein\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: This place is so fun for kids.

I found my kid within a minute of looking for him **recovering helicopter parent here**\n\nCame for a birthday party and workers actually seemed to enjoy their job and had fun with us. Even dressing up as the dragon and entertaining the party and birthday girl.\nThanks to Lee and team.\n\nBathrooms were clean and dry. I wish they had paper towels tho, instead of the Dyson hand dryer.\nStools were handy for kids to wash their hands … shockingly not a lot of kids places have that… surely helpful for the moms.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yanira Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Deaven is an amazing person.!

The structure is huge with lots of things to do and there is plenty of space for parents to sit in (also very clean!) Friendly staff. I do think grip socks should probably be required as it could get slippery in there, but it’s not a deal breaker for us. Will definitely come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nancy Macioce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This place is amazing, clean, affordable, and great staff\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: dev\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: great, i love it very much take your kids here it’s amazing\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Leiyah was so nice!

Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.\nToday is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.\nPlus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)\nIf you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelica Viramontes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Love love love this place!

The play structure is levels are tall enough for parents to join their kiddos without too much bending over, the place is super clean and airy, too! Nice people and amazing staff!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittiany Narvaez\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Party itself was great. However the check in process was cumbersome and inefficient. Several people had to check in at the same time and we had to stand outside with all of our party supplies.

Love that the claw machine keeps working until the kids get a prize. Between the rides, climbing equipment, super fun dance party room and building blocks there isn’t a down minute. They keep everything very clean and make sure all the children are well behaved in a kind way. I highly recommend this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leslie Rafael\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: My kids loved this place. Everything is clean and in great condition.

Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rena Rose\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place for a party, good visualization of the kid space.  very clean space, bring regular socks for everyone even if they are not climbing or playing, not grip socks.  Initially the sock part was odd to me but it makes a huge difference in how clean the space is which is nice.  Bright sunny fun environment, we will absolutely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shanon DeBernardi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This facility was clean, bright, and so much fun for the kids.

It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.\n\nI hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sharla Gibson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Nice employees.

It was for kids of all ages. We took our 18-month-old toddler here, and she had so much fun running around and climbing around. Very cost of friendly does not provide military discount. But I believe for myself my husband and our toddler we only spent $20.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cindy Mejorado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had our 6 year old birthday party and our host Leiyah was amazing!

My kids like it and have fun. I think you guys should allow outside food because your options aren’t every good or healthy. I will say that the area needs to be supervised more by workers. Seen multiple kids take off their shoes and play in bare feet. Other then that my kids enjoy it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James Quiblat\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Huge play area. Lots of seating for adults.

Checking out with cashier and she sees my girls in grip socks and says we no longer allow grip socks. This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessenia Gross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I absolutely loved the layout, especially the area with the chairs and the jungle gym – it was perfect for the kids to play and for parents to relax. The dance event was such a highlight! Watching Huggie come out and dance with the children was so much fun and brought big smiles to everyone’s faces. A wonderful experience for families! Music selection is also great.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Demetris Howard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Hi, Demetris.

Thank you for creating such a wonderful space!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Lealofi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Absolutely amazing experience at this children’s indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how incredibly clean and well-maintained. One worker JADE never stopped cleaning the entire facility. Star is the manager on duty. You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.\n\nOne of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.\n\nWe brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.\n\nHighly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joseph Leday\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I like this place a-lot i take my niece and nephew here all the time and we all have a blast and the employees are very nice and helpful\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sueparat Cameron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Very clean and nice for kids.

And it did not disappoint. The play area is huge! There were a variety of things for the kids to do - slides, obstacle courses, legos, a soccer area, a dance party room, and a younger area that has a ball pit. I also can’t forget to mention the mini cars the kids can drive around too! My daughter loved those. The entire facility was very clean! Compared to other play places, this was definitely the most clean one I have ever been to. You can also purchase a little box for the kiddos and it was actually affordable. We will definitely be back! I’m even looking at having my daughters birthday there.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shunran Zhang\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: Nice and clean place to go with kids, feels like they want to stay here foever❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Daniella Silverstein\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: This place is so fun for kids.

I found my kid within a minute of looking for him **recovering helicopter parent here**\n\nCame for a birthday party and workers actually seemed to enjoy their job and had fun with us. Even dressing up as the dragon and entertaining the party and birthday girl.\nThanks to Lee and team.\n\nBathrooms were clean and dry. I wish they had paper towels tho, instead of the Dyson hand dryer.\nStools were handy for kids to wash their hands … shockingly not a lot of kids places have that… surely helpful for the moms.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yanira Rodriguez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Deaven is an amazing person.!

The structure is huge with lots of things to do and there is plenty of space for parents to sit in (also very clean!) Friendly staff. I do think grip socks should probably be required as it could get slippery in there, but it’s not a deal breaker for us. Will definitely come back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nancy Macioce\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: This place is amazing, clean, affordable, and great staff\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: dev\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: great, i love it very much take your kids here it’s amazing\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: J C\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a week ago\nReview: Leiyah was so nice!

Plus, you can leave and come back so keep your receipt.\nToday is the first time getting a game card for the motorcycle, claw machine, and other games and they are more affordable than I assumed before.\nPlus, up to 2 parents are free per child in case you want to play and accompany your kids (unlike most other places)\nIf you haven’t been here before, this is hands down the best value in town…\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Angelica Viramontes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Love love love this place!

The play structure is levels are tall enough for parents to join their kiddos without too much bending over, the place is super clean and airy, too! Nice people and amazing staff!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittiany Narvaez\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: Party itself was great. However the check in process was cumbersome and inefficient. Several people had to check in at the same time and we had to stand outside with all of our party supplies.

Love that the claw machine keeps working until the kids get a prize. Between the rides, climbing equipment, super fun dance party room and building blocks there isn’t a down minute. They keep everything very clean and make sure all the children are well behaved in a kind way. I highly recommend this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leslie Rafael\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: My kids loved this place. Everything is clean and in great condition.

Highly recommend!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Rena Rose\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: Amazing place for a party, good visualization of the kid space.  very clean space, bring regular socks for everyone even if they are not climbing or playing, not grip socks.  Initially the sock part was odd to me but it makes a huge difference in how clean the space is which is nice.  Bright sunny fun environment, we will absolutely be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shanon DeBernardi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 weeks ago\nReview: This facility was clean, bright, and so much fun for the kids.

It was 6 of us 4 waivers were filled out already we had to fill out 2 more one being for my 89 year old grandmother.  She asked if she could use the bathroom while I finish filling out the waiver and paying & they told her no.  Like you're making an 89 year ole veteran hold her waste?. I just thought that was a bit inhumane and insensitive when I'm coming to spend money in your establishment. The manager Jade is who exuded this poor customer service that lost our business because we left. You can't get my money with that type of inhumane behavior. I thank the hair salon next door for being so kind as to let my grandmother use the bathroom.\n\nI hope when Ms Jade gets older if she lives that long she craps her pants in public because someone denied her use of the bathroom of all things.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sharla Gibson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 4 weeks ago\nReview: Nice employees.

It was for kids of all ages. We took our 18-month-old toddler here, and she had so much fun running around and climbing around. Very cost of friendly does not provide military discount. But I believe for myself my husband and our toddler we only spent $20.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cindy Mejorado\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: We had our 6 year old birthday party and our host Leiyah was amazing!

My kids like it and have fun. I think you guys should allow outside food because your options aren’t every good or healthy. I will say that the area needs to be supervised more by workers. Seen multiple kids take off their shoes and play in bare feet. Other then that my kids enjoy it.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: James Quiblat\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Huge play area. Lots of seating for adults.

Checking out with cashier and she sees my girls in grip socks and says we no longer allow grip socks. This isn’t on the website only that socks are mandatory. Spent additional 9$ on socks while there are several kids playing with grip socks on. Kids slip less and have better grip with grip socks. Just another scam to charge the customer for something else.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jessenia Gross\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I absolutely loved the layout, especially the area with the chairs and the jungle gym – it was perfect for the kids to play and for parents to relax. The dance event was such a highlight! Watching Huggie come out and dance with the children was so much fun and brought big smiles to everyone’s faces. A wonderful experience for families! Music selection is also great.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Demetris Howard\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Hi, Demetris.

Thank you for creating such a wonderful space!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Andrew Lealofi\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Absolutely amazing experience at this children’s indoor playground! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by how incredibly clean and well-maintained. One worker JADE never stopped cleaning the entire facility. Star is the manager on duty. You can tell she and the staff takes pride in keeping everything spotless—there are team members constantly rotating through sections to clean and sanitize, including the bathrooms, which were consistently fresh and stocked.\n\nOne of the best parts is the come-and-go policy—you can stay for the whole day and leave for breaks without losing access, which is perfect for families who want to take lunch or snack breaks outside.\n\nWe brought a little one and a few teens were there to my surprise, the teens had just as much fun climbing, crawling, and sliding through the playground! It’s safe, there is a section for toddlers and infants as well. Extremely child-proof, and built to handle active play for all ages.\n\nHighly recommend this place for families looking for a clean, fun, and safe indoor escape. We did to get out of the rain. We’ll definitely be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Joseph Leday\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: I like this place a-lot i take my niece and nephew here all the time and we all have a blast and the employees are very nice and helpful\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sueparat Cameron\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Very clean and nice for kids.

Seemed like there was a lot of people but you don’t notice it once there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vertrinia Ridley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 hours ago\nReview: Very nice place for kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anastacio Cruz\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 10 hours ago\nReview: First I have to say that the arcade play was ok. Right after that we went to the playground I took my 2 old daughter there the thing I didn't like was that my daughter got hit about 4 times there where kids there none of there parents where looking at them.  The other area where there suppose to be 3 years and younger there was older kids therethat was over 3 years old which these kids where rough. I thinks parents should looking at there kids at all times. There was some staff walking around and they didn't say anything about the older kids that where in the 3 and under section where the balls are at and slide. Im just saying to the family's that go there I found out that in the morning its better to take your toddler instead in the afternoon. In the morning they have a toddler only from a certain time. I think the staff should be more responsible what they see if thr company is enforcing the rules. Going back there again yes I would go but only in the morning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Triple Threat\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 hours ago\nReview: Awesome place the girls love it here!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Wendt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: Very fun for my toddler and cheap prices during the day when it's a little bit less chaotic.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danit Rubanoff\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 days ago\nReview: We love this place, it’s always so clean and staff is friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jenni.M01\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cyrena Davidson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan Lopez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a week ago\nReview: Friendly staff, always have a great experience.

Definitely come back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam Villanueva\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Wally Wombats is hands down one of the most delightful and family-friendly indoor playgrounds I’ve ever visited. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that feels like a breath of fresh air for parents and an absolute wonderland for kids. The space is immaculately clean, thoughtfully designed, and bursting with creative energy—it's clear the team behind Wally Wombats truly cares about making every visit a memorable experience.\n\nThe play structures are incredible—colorful, safe, and engaging for a wide range of ages. My kids could have stayed for hours exploring the climbing walls, tunnels, and slides, while the soft play areas are perfect for little ones who are just learning to crawl and walk. I especially appreciate the attention to safety: the staff keeps a watchful eye on the play zones, and everything from the flooring to the equipment feels high-quality and well-maintained.\n\nWhat really sets Wally Wombats apart, though, is the heart behind it. The staff is exceptional—kind, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about creating a positive environment. They go above and beyond to ensure families feel welcome and supported, whether it’s helping with a birthday party setup or offering a friendly smile when you need a coffee break. Speaking of which, the café area is a fantastic touch! It’s a cozy space where parents can relax while the kids play, and the menu has plenty of options that make it easy to refuel without leaving the building.\n\nWally Wombats is also an incredible spot for hosting parties and special events. Their team takes care of the details so you can actually enjoy the day with your family, and they make every celebration feel special and unique.\n\nWhether you're looking for a safe, engaging place for your kids to burn off energy or a welcoming community space for families to connect, Wally Wombats delivers in every way. It’s a gem in the community, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. If you’re in the area, do yourself and your family a favor—come experience the magic of Wally Wombats!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yon Mongcal\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The place is actually fun for kids looking clean. The only problem is that the noise which K don’t know where is it coming from and it terrifies my boy ( May not affect other kids ). But the place is actually good for the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matisla\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Went for the first time on a Sunday at 10 AM, so glad we got there early because it wasn’t crowded yet. Everything looked clean and I saw a staff member regularly spraying down the equipment, which was nice. My 4 year old had so much fun running around!\n\nOnly downside was they didn’t let us use the bikes. The staff said it was too crowded but honestly, it didn’t feel that way. We didn’t try the food or drinks so can’t comment on that. Overall, a fun spot- we’ll probably be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: N M (Redfeline)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5-star rating!

That upsets me because the guy knew that. Why aren't employees  taking pride in their work.\nIf they wouldn't eat it like that, why would they have someone else to do so.\n\nOther than that it's ok..minor adjustments should be considered.\n\nAlso not being able to bring your food in is a game changer especially little snacks for babies.\nBut I can deal with that!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sheree Dickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Our son always has a blast here!!

They stopped with therapy then turned it into an arcade. The staff here is rude at times. It seems like it lost the purpose of what wally wombat used to be. A place where kids were respected and valued and mostly cared for. This is just a dark dimmed playground now. My kids like the indoor playground because this is where they started their therapies. It became like a second home. Now the price to even play has gone up so much and also most of the staff just has an icky face towards childre. Like why even hire people like that. Another issue, it happens a lot ... when trying to get our bucket up front our profile 'doesn't show up\" so I have to go and re do the waiver again and again. It saddens me how this place was so amazing for kids is rotten bit by bit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christian Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Thank you Christian for your 5-star rating!

Seemed like there was a lot of people but you don’t notice it once there\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Vertrinia Ridley\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 hours ago\nReview: Very nice place for kids\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anastacio Cruz\nRating: 2/5\nTime: 10 hours ago\nReview: First I have to say that the arcade play was ok. Right after that we went to the playground I took my 2 old daughter there the thing I didn't like was that my daughter got hit about 4 times there where kids there none of there parents where looking at them.  The other area where there suppose to be 3 years and younger there was older kids therethat was over 3 years old which these kids where rough. I thinks parents should looking at there kids at all times. There was some staff walking around and they didn't say anything about the older kids that where in the 3 and under section where the balls are at and slide. Im just saying to the family's that go there I found out that in the morning its better to take your toddler instead in the afternoon. In the morning they have a toddler only from a certain time. I think the staff should be more responsible what they see if thr company is enforcing the rules. Going back there again yes I would go but only in the morning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Triple Threat\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 10 hours ago\nReview: Awesome place the girls love it here!!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Nicole Wendt\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a day ago\nReview: Very fun for my toddler and cheap prices during the day when it's a little bit less chaotic.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Danit Rubanoff\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 5 days ago\nReview: We love this place, it’s always so clean and staff is friendly.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: jenni.M01\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cyrena Davidson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 6 days ago\nReview: N/A\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Jonathan Lopez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: Edited a week ago\nReview: Friendly staff, always have a great experience.

Definitely come back\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sam Villanueva\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Wally Wombats is hands down one of the most delightful and family-friendly indoor playgrounds I’ve ever visited. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that feels like a breath of fresh air for parents and an absolute wonderland for kids. The space is immaculately clean, thoughtfully designed, and bursting with creative energy—it's clear the team behind Wally Wombats truly cares about making every visit a memorable experience.\n\nThe play structures are incredible—colorful, safe, and engaging for a wide range of ages. My kids could have stayed for hours exploring the climbing walls, tunnels, and slides, while the soft play areas are perfect for little ones who are just learning to crawl and walk. I especially appreciate the attention to safety: the staff keeps a watchful eye on the play zones, and everything from the flooring to the equipment feels high-quality and well-maintained.\n\nWhat really sets Wally Wombats apart, though, is the heart behind it. The staff is exceptional—kind, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about creating a positive environment. They go above and beyond to ensure families feel welcome and supported, whether it’s helping with a birthday party setup or offering a friendly smile when you need a coffee break. Speaking of which, the café area is a fantastic touch! It’s a cozy space where parents can relax while the kids play, and the menu has plenty of options that make it easy to refuel without leaving the building.\n\nWally Wombats is also an incredible spot for hosting parties and special events. Their team takes care of the details so you can actually enjoy the day with your family, and they make every celebration feel special and unique.\n\nWhether you're looking for a safe, engaging place for your kids to burn off energy or a welcoming community space for families to connect, Wally Wombats delivers in every way. It’s a gem in the community, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. If you’re in the area, do yourself and your family a favor—come experience the magic of Wally Wombats!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yon Mongcal\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: The place is actually fun for kids looking clean. The only problem is that the noise which K don’t know where is it coming from and it terrifies my boy ( May not affect other kids ). But the place is actually good for the kids.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Matisla\nRating: 4/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Went for the first time on a Sunday at 10 AM, so glad we got there early because it wasn’t crowded yet. Everything looked clean and I saw a staff member regularly spraying down the equipment, which was nice. My 4 year old had so much fun running around!\n\nOnly downside was they didn’t let us use the bikes. The staff said it was too crowded but honestly, it didn’t feel that way. We didn’t try the food or drinks so can’t comment on that. Overall, a fun spot- we’ll probably be back!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: N M (Redfeline)\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Thank you for your 5-star rating!

That upsets me because the guy knew that. Why aren't employees  taking pride in their work.\nIf they wouldn't eat it like that, why would they have someone else to do so.\n\nOther than that it's ok..minor adjustments should be considered.\n\nAlso not being able to bring your food in is a game changer especially little snacks for babies.\nBut I can deal with that!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sheree Dickson\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a month ago\nReview: Our son always has a blast here!!

They stopped with therapy then turned it into an arcade. The staff here is rude at times. It seems like it lost the purpose of what wally wombat used to be. A place where kids were respected and valued and mostly cared for. This is just a dark dimmed playground now. My kids like the indoor playground because this is where they started their therapies. It became like a second home. Now the price to even play has gone up so much and also most of the staff just has an icky face towards childre. Like why even hire people like that. Another issue, it happens a lot ... when trying to get our bucket up front our profile 'doesn't show up\" so I have to go and re do the waiver again and again. It saddens me how this place was so amazing for kids is rotten bit by bit!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Christian Ledford\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Thank you Christian for your 5-star rating!

As a teacher of over 25 years, the concept is good but the pricing is WOW!!!  Even their membership prices were shocking to me.  So for price tag alone, I don't see the value in what they offer.  It would be nice to see this offered lower to allow potentially a little more learning access to children of families who can not afford the prices this place charges.   So, there is some good... with a little bit of a negative taste in my mouth that this is designed for the wealthy and upper elite families.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Frankie Patetta\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I've had the pleasure of working with Bailey on a business level.

It allows my oldest to have some play time with other friends and my baby to meet others. There are times when I need to work and able to step away to focus on it. Wonder and unwind is the best place for little ones. Bailey always has a warm and welcoming vibe and her team is the best. Shout out to Tillie and Marina for always giving a helping hand ❤️\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Chen\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place to unwind!

She could play in a safe, stimulating environment while I got some much-needed work done on my laptop.\n\nThe space is beautiful, clean, and I always felt at ease knowing she was playing and learning in a space that encouraged creativity and independence. Meanwhile, I could relax with a cup of coffee and actually be productive.\n\nEven after moving to California, I still think about how special this place is. There’s nothing quite like it where I live now. Wonder & Unwind truly understands the balance parents are trying to strike between caregiving and taking care of their own needs. I can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chelsey Flores\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: This is such a great concept for parents wanting to have their littles near while we can get work done, I can’t wait to see Wonder & Unwind grow and even possibly into a bigger space (or maybe expand on the “parents” section) because if one is working or reading, the kids can still be pretty loud or present. But again, great concept and very clean space. We enjoyed our time here. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shawntel Bacon\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Great place to bring the young ones.

She is special needs and the layout was very detailed and the play structure was accessible. Staff from front desk to employees in the individual rooms were also very helpful and nice!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shadi Amirshahi\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: Overall, the staff is kind and professional, which I appreciate.\nUnfortunately, I’m having a negative experience with one of the parents here. My 2‑year‑old baby, out of innocent curiosity, touches her keyboard, and instead of handling it gently, she aggressively pulls it from his hands. As a mother, it’s really upsetting to see. A little patience and understanding goes a long way, especially in a shared space with children around.\nI won’t be returning to this place.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: vidya m\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 months ago\nReview: I LOVE THIS PLACE!!\nThere are so many great things about it — it’s women-owned, has an incredible staff, and is the perfect spot for work-from-home parents. While you plug into high-speed internet and get work done, the staff takes wonderful care of your children.\n\nThey offer free coffee with every check-in (yes, free coffee!), and if you’re like me and always need a second cup, the prices are super reasonable. The snack options for kids are thoughtful, and the fresh, fruit-infused water is such a refreshing touch.\n\nI’ve brought my daughter here many times — and we even celebrated her birthday here! We first discovered the space when a friend hosted her daughter’s party here, and we were hooked. I booked it right after (make sure to plan ahead — it’s a popular spot!). The team made party planning so easy: they handled the decorations, the cake, and even the party favors.\n\nI truly miss this place and the wonderful people who make it so special. I can’t wait to visit again when I’m in town. I honestly can’t recommend it enough!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Michelle Erney\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: I live in AZ but always make a point to bring my son when I'm in Reno- he loves it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Hannah Haynes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Love this spot!!

There are always friends and activities to play with, and their staff is friendly and engaging with them so I can unwind or focus.  I’ve made some great mom-friend connections sipping my coffee chatting in the lounge, and I’ve also had a needed nap or two on the couch.\n\nI bought a punch pass and love the freedom to come 2-3 times a month, or not feel like I’m missing out on membership dues if my kids are sick for two months.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: ROBIN ABDULLAH\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: Wow this place is amazing for the little ones.

I'm definitely going to have to come back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shelby Hedman\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: As a parent coach, play therapist, and parent; this place is amazing. It is such a wonderful place to take kiddos, enjoy the cafe, and either engage with your kiddos or get work done. They have a very friendly staff that is always there for extra eyes on your kiddo. They provide open ended toys to promote development and encourage the use of imagination. The owner is always friendly and remembers you by name.

It’s so nice to sit and have a cup of coffee and a snack while your kiddos get to play safely in a variety of different rooms.  The staff is always wonderful and kind.\n\nI wanted to add to my review after reading some negative reviews that felt unfair to Wonder and Unwind.  First off, this is not a daycare, and while the staff is well trained and there to supervise they are not babysitters.  So if you plan to come and totally check out (ie you’re working or scrolling on your phone) you are still the parent and if your kid is causing chaos you need to parent your child.\n\nLastly about cleanliness, I feel they have always done their best to keep toys sanitized.  They opened their doors when all the COVID shutdowns were happening, so from the get go that was important to them.  I think this comes down to parenting again, don’t take your kids to public places when they are sick.    No amount of sanitizing is going to help if your child is actively playing next to a sneezing, snotty nosed toddler.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: S V\nRating: 4/5\nTime: 3 months ago\nReview: This place is good for infants and toddlers to spend some good time. It would have been better if the sqft would have been more. There is a place for parents to sit and have some food and do some personal work.

Clean, safe, There’s a very big play area for a variety of ages, nice seating area for adults to relax or work. Snacks, coffees or tea are available for purchase at a very reasonable price.

It’s the perfect place to let kids play while parents get to relax and have a cup of delicious coffee. The staff keeps a very close eye on the kiddos and I feel safe and relaxed while my daughter has a blast. There is plenty of activities for babies, toddlers, young school age kiddos to have fun and learn as well. It’s an ideal spot for those of us who don’t have family nearby and need a break or for a kiddo to get activities in to sleep better later. The cost is really affordable and comes with a freshly made delicious drink. They have the best birthday parties as well. We have had the last 3 birthday parties for my daughter there. The birthday parties are private and only your guests and the staff will be there. All of your needs are accounted for and the parents can sigh a breath of relief knowing the kiddos are safe and having fun.

I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oshun 4U\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 days ago\nReview: Very clean, staff were friendly and helpful.

Very nice, clean & cool. Rafi was the attendant working and he was extremely kind and caring. It’s also nice that our kids get to play with other children. Next time we are in town during the hotter months we’ll be sure to stop by here again (and remember to bring socks 😅) so the kids are able to play in the air conditioning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carolyn Kohanski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: It was the best thing ever.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody IV\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We loved this indoor playground.

We have tried many and none of them deliver the same as Kidstopia. Not to mention that they literally have the nicest management/owners. From the moment you enter, you feel like you’re part of their family/world.  Also, their facility is extremely clean, and so big and safe, it makes throwing birthdays and spending evenings or weekends here pretty magical for our kids😍😍\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lesly Pordes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We had our 3 year oldest birthday party at Kidstopia and we loved it. The place is very clean and has trampolines, swings, big wheels, slides, and other games for kids. There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linda Hang\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: If I can do no stars I would! They need to do better with their appointment dates! I booked an open play a month ago! A month! For Thanksgiving day. Nowhere on the website or when booking the open play says they will be closed for the holiday. The holiday wasn't blacked out either. So I THOUGHT they were going to be open since not everywhere is closed. Or they could had send me an email saying they were closed on that day and to reschedule I would of done it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leslie Aboud\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The owner was so nice.

I will be going back for sure.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sebrina\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: It was pretty cool except for the managers /person running the place on 10/29 in the morning son.\nMy 1 year old daugher went exploring into the bounce house and this 5 or 6 year old boy went inside it literally jumping on top of her stepping on her on purpose. We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.\nMy daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.\n\nOtherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shirley Furlong-Lim\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This place is clean and organized. The owner is very nice and friendly.

Positives: nice staff, clean bathrooms, not too busy. Negatives: you have to pay extra to use the arcade games and many of them didn't even work or were missing buttons. The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Princess Tolentino\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I rented this place for my daughter’s 1st bday.

The staff was very friendly and very attentive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris We\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dana Telfer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We had the best time at Kidstopia for my son's third birthday!

We did the semi-private weekend party package and had about 50 people in our party alone but it was nice to also share the venue with the public. The party room is huge and has a private bathroom for your guests.\nThe party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here. Not to mention Lucas (owner) and his staff are very friendly and easy to work with\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sonji\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charisse Najarro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was a success.

Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Phillip Busche\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday there, was great.

Overall, just a nice establishment to be able to support.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louie S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a really lovely indoor playground.

I booked the party room for 2pm to 5pm, a little after 4 pm staff began coming into the room and rushing us to clean and exit because there was a party booked for 5:30. Not sure why they’d have a time slot for a 5:30 party after our party ENDED at 5 but yeah that was unprofessional and annoying we were left scrambling to clean and end the party because she said the other party arrived. I think timing just needs to be changed because if i booked a party until 5:00pm that should give me time to dismiss everyone and start cleaning\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Oshun 4U\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 days ago\nReview: Very clean, staff were friendly and helpful.

Next time we are in town during the hotter months we’ll be sure to stop by here again (and remember to bring socks 😅) so the kids are able to play in the air conditioning.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Carolyn Kohanski\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: It was the best thing ever.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Cody IV\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 2 weeks ago\nReview: We loved this indoor playground.

We have tried many and none of them deliver the same as Kidstopia. Not to mention that they literally have the nicest management/owners. From the moment you enter, you feel like you’re part of their family/world.  Also, their facility is extremely clean, and so big and safe, it makes throwing birthdays and spending evenings or weekends here pretty magical for our kids😍😍\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Lesly Pordes\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: We had our 3 year oldest birthday party at Kidstopia and we loved it. The place is very clean and has trampolines, swings, big wheels, slides, and other games for kids. There is an area for parents to sit back and relax while still being able to watch their kids easily. The party room was big, clean and very nicely painted. They helped set up tables with kid colored plastic table clothes and provided cutlery, napkins, plates, cups, cooler, and speaker to use. The attendant for the evening was Raffi and he was so helpful and friendly. My 3 year old loves this place and insists on going often. Great place!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Linda Hang\nRating: 1/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: If I can do no stars I would! They need to do better with their appointment dates! I booked an open play a month ago! A month! For Thanksgiving day. Nowhere on the website or when booking the open play says they will be closed for the holiday. The holiday wasn't blacked out either. So I THOUGHT they were going to be open since not everywhere is closed. Or they could had send me an email saying they were closed on that day and to reschedule I would of done it!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Leslie Aboud\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 7 months ago\nReview: The owner was so nice.

We told him to stop several times in different ways.  Even when she got upset and started crawling towards me he continued to jump on her. The manager then put him in the car with his wife kissed her and they left. He could've alteast helped when his son was jumping on top of my 1 year old daughter.\nMy daughter no longer had fun after that. She was upset.\n\nOtherwise it was a clean place. Some machines are broken.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Shirley Furlong-Lim\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 8 months ago\nReview: This place is clean and organized. The owner is very nice and friendly.

Positives: nice staff, clean bathrooms, not too busy. Negatives: you have to pay extra to use the arcade games and many of them didn't even work or were missing buttons. The play area appeared neglected and in need of repairs as well. Overall, your kid won't get to enjoy everything there because it's broken or doesn't work.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Princess Tolentino\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I rented this place for my daughter’s 1st bday. I have to say this place is very clean and spacious especially the party room. I love how the place offers areas for little to big kids. The arcade was a hit for the older kids. The staff was very friendly and very attentive.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Chris We\nRating: 3/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: It’s a fun place for the size. My 2 year old and I had a blast. I was very surprised. The reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the price and availability - out of the last 3 times I went they only been open once. Almost everyday during peak times I would want to go and find out it’s booked for a private party for 5 hours of the day. I’m not coming back at 7pm. 2 hours is one thing but 5 hours from 2-7pm ??? And sorry but $15 for the size of the place is ridiculous. Should be $10 or $15 including some tokens for the kids considering the size and stuff to do. I will say though it’s a fun place and I understand why they do birthday parties and block it off but you should reduce the times a bit and the price a little. Having said that we had a fun experience the one time they were actually open. And as a parent it’s a lot easier to watch your kids in a smaller place than a giant building full of mazes. :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Dana Telfer\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: We had the best time at Kidstopia for my son's third birthday! We booked last minute bc of the extreme heat warnings, and they made everything so easy and fun! We will definitely be returning to take advantage of the clean, air conditioned facilities!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Evelyn De Jesus\nRating: 5/5\nTime: 11 months ago\nReview: I was hired to face paint at a party here and I must say I was impressed! You will have to take your shoes off, which I think is great. The party room is so large. The kids really looked like they were having a blast! I plan to return with my grandson. Only negative is the parking lot is a bit small. Owners seemed very friendly too. Great place!!! 👍🏽👍🏽\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Anthony Proano\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great experience! The kids loved it! The owner, Loucas, and his team really went above and beyond. They take care of you and make sure the party is a good time. We will be back.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Yenisey Ramirez\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Great place to host a birthday party.

Good Music.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Ashley Ka’awa\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Recently had my son’s 3rd birthday party here and it was such a great time! We did the semi-private weekend party package and had about 50 people in our party alone but it was nice to also share the venue with the public. The party room is huge and has a private bathroom for your guests.\nThe party package comes with table cloths, all paper products (plates, utensils, napkins, cups) goodie bags, tokens, and clean up. I only wish that they allowed more time to set up as we were only given 30min. Overall we had such a fun time and would 100% recommend having your party here. Not to mention Lucas (owner) and his staff are very friendly and easy to work with\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Sonji\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: The Best! Loucas so was nice an accommodating for my nieces 4th birthday party. You can rent out just the private room, or the entire place. The kids were so busy on all of the various games and activities that we had to kind of bring them into the room to get their face painted for the birthday party. There is plenty of things for children to do to keep them active. Even after Loucas And his staff member cleaned up. So all we did was had the party, brought in our food, packed up the food and the decorations. And they literally cleaned up everything else. I highly highly recommend this place for your child’s birthday party or if you just wanna take your child up there to have fun and wear them out. lol 😂\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Charisse Najarro\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: I had my daughter’s 6th birthday party here and it was a success.

I would recommend this place for your kid’s parties!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Brittney Moore\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: We had the best experience having our daughter’s 4th birthday party here this past Saturday!! Loucas (owner) And his staff were extremely accommodating from getting back to me quickly on the booking, letting us come the day early and set up the party! There are many party venues out there that leave you on your own to provide all the supplies for birthday parties but Kidstopia provided plates, silverware, Napkins, and table covers. The facility is very spacious and clean! The party room is spacious and they also clean up after each party as well!! They even provided things I hadn’t even thought of like scissors, a lighter, and a supply closet with just about anything you could imagine or need. My daughter had one of the best birthday parties thus far and we will definitely be back not just for birthday parties but for kids playtime; As I felt their facility was so much more fun than Chuck E. Cheese or some of the other indoor places!! My 8 year old and her friends had a blast and they have games and entertainment for older kids as well!! Not to mention they have a lounging area with massage chairs for parents to relax while your kids play. I also loved that they keep the gate locked and secure to prevent kids from being able to leave without their parents; So it’s very safe and secure here! I also like that they have a doorbell that you have to ring to be let in which made me feel even more safe knowing not just anybody can walk in Especially these days!! This facility and experience Far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend any and everybody to have a birthday party here for your kids You will not regret it!! Many people from my daughters birthday party Asked me how I found this place And we’re very impressed as well with how fun it was for all ages!!! Enjoy your time here I definitely want to support small business owners like this who run their facilities right as opposed to some of the bigger chain indoor play places out there!! It’s all about the little things that they provided!! Plus for what you get I feel the prices are fair and very reasonable. It was an all around 5 star Experience!!\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Phillip Busche\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: Had our daughters birthday there, was great.

The owner Loucas and his employees are so friendly and so hospitable. Our daughter’s birthday party was a success. There was even ample room to have Pose Party Post set up a braid bar for the girls. The kids had so much fun and could not get enough of the claw machine there. The parents that came were able sit back and relax knowing their kids were in sight and safe.\nThey set up the party room too which is such a huge help! Overall, just a nice establishment to be able to support.\n\n-----------------------\n\nReviewer: Louie S\nRating: 5/5\nTime: a year ago\nReview: This is a really lovely indoor playground.

The carpet is like brand new, the play equipment is in perfect condition, staff are very friendly and helpful, my little girl loves it here. Party room is big and spacious and beautifully decorated and again spotless. I am really impressed with Kidstopja and highly recommend it to children of all ages. It’s the only play center my child goes to and doesn’t end up sick the next day thanks to how clean and hygienic the place is.
