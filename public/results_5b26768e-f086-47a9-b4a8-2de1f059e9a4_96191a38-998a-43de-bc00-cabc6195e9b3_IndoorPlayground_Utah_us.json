First off, it has several new slides and play areas that are super fun! My kids loved the step slides and the tube slide. The workers here today were awesome. Friendly and attentive helping to boost our experience. One of them helped make the tube slide more slick and even won stuffed animals from the claw machines for each of my kids! It is clean and not over crowded like the one in Bluffdale often is but that could just be because we came on the 4th. Also they had a Mother's room which was amazing. It was clean and the nursing chair was comfortable. I love the space theme too! There were a few things that didn't work like the ball cannon and a free others which was slightly disappointing since it's so new but overall didn't hinder our experience. Lastly, my 3 year old wandered off and got lost and the workers found her remembered she belonged to me and found me quickly. Overall we had a stellar experience! I wish this one was closer to Riverton!"

So much fun. I'm not sure of the exact price just for day entry but for birthday parties it was amazing! I did see their birthday party prices and I do feel like they're a little high, but maybe every birthday goer that comes can help chip in like $5 or something, If you're worried about that.\nSeriously, such a fun place!"

In the span of the 2 hours we were there, we saw multiple kids get hurt due to the extremely steep slides and not knowing how to go down them with the pad/tube or too many kids going at once. There really should be someone ensuring the safety of others. The bathrooms were also super unattended - trash overflowing, lots of wet spots. Overall it was clean (it's new) and super unique compared to other indoor playgrounds but they absolutely need more supervision and staff otherwise serious injury will absolutely occur. If you bring your kids, be sure to watch them closely or follow them on the equipment."

It is very clean, bright, and the atmosphere was good. The employees were attentive, quick, and kind. They have a lot of seating options for parents/spectators to watch the children---but also have the option for parents to join their kids which I greatly appreciated. Their slides were amazing, and my son had a blast on them! He also loved the obstacle course they have! The metal slides were probably his favorite along with the tube slide. He also loved to play the claw machines and the prizes in them were great! I can absolutely see the value in having the monthly pass which is what we signed him up for-but their punch cards are also very reasonable! My son is really wanting to have his birthday party here, so that may have to happen this year! For those who have smaller children they have a whole section dedicated to them, and it looks really cute and fun for kids. Our son is nearly 8 so he did not go into this area, but I also appreciated that it is blocked off to ensure that larger kids are not running into the smaller children. We will of course definitely be returning!"

Had to pay extra for that.\n\nThey have these gates that you need wrist bands to go through that are not very kid friendly. Ive seen so many kids cry trying to get in and out and the gates wont open or they shut on you. They've squished so many kids behind them too when they open.\n\nAnd it is overpriced.  Charging for children not even 1 years old is kinda ridiculous considering half the time a baby isn't even playing.\n\nPROS: On the bright side - the place is great for kids to play and has plenty of things to do for all ages (except for 1 and under). I do like the containment but the gates are annoying for the little kids.\n\nMy only complaints was the poor customer service and the price. I was not impressed with either of those, otherwise I would've rated higher stars."

Some of these slides are SO SO steep and fast, your big kids will love them but there’s also tons for littles.

They do provide restrooms, and they even have a mother's room, I love that! You have to fill a waiver when you arrive and fill out the information, they give you a wrist band with a specific color, when your 2 hours are up, they tell you over the microphone/speaker system  The only thing I would really change is that their speaker system is extremely hard to hear, just be sure to keep track of your time."

First off, it has several new slides and play areas that are super fun! My kids loved the step slides and the tube slide. The workers here today were awesome. Friendly and attentive helping to boost our experience. One of them helped make the tube slide more slick and even won stuffed animals from the claw machines for each of my kids! It is clean and not over crowded like the one in Bluffdale often is but that could just be because we came on the 4th. Also they had a Mother's room which was amazing. It was clean and the nursing chair was comfortable. I love the space theme too! There were a few things that didn't work like the ball cannon and a free others which was slightly disappointing since it's so new but overall didn't hinder our experience. Lastly, my 3 year old wandered off and got lost and the workers found her remembered she belonged to me and found me quickly. Overall we had a stellar experience! I wish this one was closer to Riverton!"

Everything you can do is kid friendly and adult friendly if you can imagine that. We were a little sad that the zip line was closed off, but I'm sure it will be great once it's up and running. So much fun. I'm not sure of the exact price just for day entry but for birthday parties it was amazing! I did see their birthday party prices and I do feel like they're a little high, but maybe every birthday goer that comes can help chip in like $5 or something, If you're worried about that.\nSeriously, such a fun place!"

There are two different rooms that have there own slides too making it super easy for kids to go down to the play area."

In the span of the 2 hours we were there, we saw multiple kids get hurt due to the extremely steep slides and not knowing how to go down them with the pad/tube or too many kids going at once. There really should be someone ensuring the safety of others. The bathrooms were also super unattended - trash overflowing, lots of wet spots. Overall it was clean (it's new) and super unique compared to other indoor playgrounds but they absolutely need more supervision and staff otherwise serious injury will absolutely occur. If you bring your kids, be sure to watch them closely or follow them on the equipment."

It is very clean, bright, and the atmosphere was good. The employees were attentive, quick, and kind. They have a lot of seating options for parents/spectators to watch the children---but also have the option for parents to join their kids which I greatly appreciated. Their slides were amazing, and my son had a blast on them! He also loved the obstacle course they have! The metal slides were probably his favorite along with the tube slide. He also loved to play the claw machines and the prizes in them were great! I can absolutely see the value in having the monthly pass which is what we signed him up for-but their punch cards are also very reasonable! My son is really wanting to have his birthday party here, so that may have to happen this year! For those who have smaller children they have a whole section dedicated to them, and it looks really cute and fun for kids. Our son is nearly 8 so he did not go into this area, but I also appreciated that it is blocked off to ensure that larger kids are not running into the smaller children. We will of course definitely be returning!"

Had to pay extra for that.\n\nThey have these gates that you need wrist bands to go through that are not very kid friendly. Ive seen so many kids cry trying to get in and out and the gates wont open or they shut on you. They've squished so many kids behind them too when they open.\n\nAnd it is overpriced.  Charging for children not even 1 years old is kinda ridiculous considering half the time a baby isn't even playing.\n\nPROS: On the bright side - the place is great for kids to play and has plenty of things to do for all ages (except for 1 and under). I do like the containment but the gates are annoying for the little kids.\n\nMy only complaints was the poor customer service and the price. I was not impressed with either of those, otherwise I would've rated higher stars."

Some of these slides are SO SO steep and fast, your big kids will love them but there’s also tons for littles.

They do provide restrooms, and they even have a mother's room, I love that! You have to fill a waiver when you arrive and fill out the information, they give you a wrist band with a specific color, when your 2 hours are up, they tell you over the microphone/speaker system  The only thing I would really change is that their speaker system is extremely hard to hear, just be sure to keep track of your time."

Tru Play was twice as big and it was $10 per child / $8 per additional sibling so it does feel a little painful paying more for less.. But it’s definitely a local business worth supporting! The staff are always kind, the facility is kept tidy, there’s still a good variety of toys that suit different ages, and the kids are happy playing/making friends."

It was all set up before we got there and they cleaned up after us too. Another thing we liked was the own played freeze dance with the kids and other dancing songs for them. They all loved it!

Three out of the four black couches were severely worn- they had bits of plastic peeling off and crumbling. Those bits of plastic are everywhere. The foam cubes need to be replaced- they have so many holes like people took bites out of them all. Because they are also super worn, the foam from the cubes also is deteriorating and gets everywhere.  They also need employees walking around occasionally to make sure people are following rules to just ensure the younger kids are safe.\n\nWill I be back? Probably- my kid had a blast. It just needs a bit of a facelift."

Paid for a party room for my son, big waste of money and I wish I could’ve spent it somewhere better. Their AC was broken the day we came in, so our party room was about 80 degrees. The guy working the front desk looked like he absolutely hated his life and would rather have been somewhere else. The party for TEN kids and TEN adults, only comes with one pizza and if you want more than one, it’s an additional cost. Absolutely NO drinks are provided for the party, but oh, there’s drinks you can pay for in the lobby. Your party does not get a hostess to help you out or show you how things work. Not the mention, people in my party got charged for grip socks despite telling the front desk that they were with us. Huge rip off and I doubt I will be back. The pictures on their website make things look so much better but you get there and it’s very run down and the employees seem to hate their jobs. For the amount I was charged with, I had higher expectations and will be planning my parties elsewhere."

The staff was really great and insanely accommodating. They literally let me do whatever I wanted to make the party special. I also loved that at the end of the night an entire team of cleaners showed up. It made me feel much better about the cleanliness of the playground.\nThe only reason why I am not updating to 5 stars is because I still stand by what I said in my original review, maybe even more so now. They need a capacity limit. This facility is so amazing and fun but once you get too many kids in there, it becomes a miserable place to be.\n\n**Original Review**\nI think they would benefit greatly from some sort of capacity limit. Great concept and I love that my husband and I could climb and play with our daughter. However, it is pure chaos. No employees helping control the bigger and more rowdy kids. Kids not waiting their turn and crashing into each other on slides or climbing up from the bottom. It also smells absolutely horrible, especially the higher up you go in the play ground. I’m not sure what people are talking about then they say there is hand sanitizer everywhere because I didn’t see a single dispenser."

My kids have a blast and love the freedom to run, jump and climb. Unfortunately it's starting to go downhill in terms of cleanliness and upkeep. The top side of the playground is covered in dust. Lots of balls and trash littered too. The \"Party Rooms\" are looking more and more haggard. Room C is nice because it's an actual room and you can shut the door and quiet the din, but the walls are patchy and it looks kinda grungy. So at least bring extra decorations. The benches and tables they have you rent for parties are flimsy and definitely need a deep steam clean/scrub.\nThey have a single air purifier tower in the place, and not a lot of ventilation. They recommend people wear masks inside (according to their tv menu screens inside).\nThe women's bathroom trashes are always overflowing whenever we visit. And it reeks of dirty diapers. They have a trashcan by the changing table but the lid was broken off.\nThe staff do their best, there's typically only two employees and they're usually busy at the front desk. Sometimes they'll walk around the playground and pickup socks and balls.\nI'm hoping the business owners see this and consider doing a deep clean and a round of TLC on the facility so it continues looking nice and comfortable. And maybe add another part time position so someone can stay on top of cleaning and monitoring the playground."

It only took two times for me walking up there and seeing grown men standing by themselves…Creeper status!!…my husband even said one followed me to the other side of the play place. Never again. I will never take my kids here again. I will tell all of my girlfriends to stop taking their kids here because this used to be a place where I could sit and relax while my kids go and play and now I don’t trust the adults that go up and hide in the play areas. Realistically, any grown adults or teenager could walk into this building without paying and walk up into their hiding spot. This is not a safe space."

The only negative to me is the cute toddler space is ALWAYS overrun with older kids that are definitely older than 3. My oldest can go play on the big kid playground, but the supposedly safe space for my young toddler isn’t safe at all with the older kids jumping in the ball pit and pushing the little kids out of their way.  I wish there was a way to enforce the age restriction better, and give the young kids and their parents a safe play space.\nAlso, the last time I was there I saw not one, but two kids running around in just diapers that had a full load in them, definitely not sanitary so I pulled my kid from the toddler area."

They changed the sleds and they literally get stuck and you have to walk on the awful peg slide to retrieve your kid. Then, the covered the trampoline so you can no longer jump. It's still a fun place and cleaner than similar places but covering the trampoline and making the sleds not slide is a disappointment.\n*child is at a dead stop in photo."

It’s nice to have a facility be very conscious.\n\nOk the bad- sooooo many broken things. NONE of the air ball items worked- they all had issues with air pressure being too weak. Three out of the four black couches were severely worn- they had bits of plastic peeling off and crumbling. Those bits of plastic are everywhere. The foam cubes need to be replaced- they have so many holes like people took bites out of them all. Because they are also super worn, the foam from the cubes also is deteriorating and gets everywhere.  They also need employees walking around occasionally to make sure people are following rules to just ensure the younger kids are safe.\n\nWill I be back? Probably- my kid had a blast. It just needs a bit of a facelift."

Paid for a party room for my son, big waste of money and I wish I could’ve spent it somewhere better. Their AC was broken the day we came in, so our party room was about 80 degrees. The guy working the front desk looked like he absolutely hated his life and would rather have been somewhere else. The party for TEN kids and TEN adults, only comes with one pizza and if you want more than one, it’s an additional cost. Absolutely NO drinks are provided for the party, but oh, there’s drinks you can pay for in the lobby. Your party does not get a hostess to help you out or show you how things work. Not the mention, people in my party got charged for grip socks despite telling the front desk that they were with us. Huge rip off and I doubt I will be back. The pictures on their website make things look so much better but you get there and it’s very run down and the employees seem to hate their jobs. For the amount I was charged with, I had higher expectations and will be planning my parties elsewhere."

The cameras are also super helpful.\nCrowded-ness depends on the day and time (more busy weekends and evenings)\nWe regularly see the team up around and inside the play area with vacuums to get crumbs and such.\nHosted a birthday party here as well with zero issues. They did the room setup, provided the basic food utensils and paper goods and we didn’t have to clean up."

It’s pretty disgusting and I don’t think we will be coming back. We asked one of the workers how often they clean and he didn’t seem to know. It was pretty gross."

The staff was really great and insanely accommodating. They literally let me do whatever I wanted to make the party special. I also loved that at the end of the night an entire team of cleaners showed up. It made me feel much better about the cleanliness of the playground.\nThe only reason why I am not updating to 5 stars is because I still stand by what I said in my original review, maybe even more so now. They need a capacity limit. This facility is so amazing and fun but once you get too many kids in there, it becomes a miserable place to be.\n\n**Original Review**\nI think they would benefit greatly from some sort of capacity limit. Great concept and I love that my husband and I could climb and play with our daughter. However, it is pure chaos. No employees helping control the bigger and more rowdy kids. Kids not waiting their turn and crashing into each other on slides or climbing up from the bottom. It also smells absolutely horrible, especially the higher up you go in the play ground. I’m not sure what people are talking about then they say there is hand sanitizer everywhere because I didn’t see a single dispenser."

          "content": "We've visited this location several times over the last couple of years. It's definitely one of the largest indoor playgrounds in the state. My kids have a blast and love the freedom to run, jump and climb. Unfortunately it's starting to go downhill in terms of cleanliness and upkeep. The top side of the playground is covered in dust. Lots of balls and trash littered too. The \"Party Rooms\" are looking more and more haggard. Room C is nice because it's an actual room and you can shut the door and quiet the din, but the walls are patchy and it looks kinda grungy. So at least bring extra decorations. The benches and tables they have you rent for parties are flimsy and definitely need a deep steam clean/scrub.\nThey have a single air purifier tower in the place, and not a lot of ventilation. They recommend people wear masks inside (according to their tv menu screens inside).\nThe women's bathroom trashes are always overflowing whenever we visit. And it reeks of dirty diapers. They have a trashcan by the changing table but the lid was broken off.\nThe staff do their best, there's typically only two employees and they're usually busy at the front desk. Sometimes they'll walk around the playground and pickup socks and balls.\nI'm hoping the business owners see this and consider doing a deep clean and a round of TLC on the facility so it continues looking nice and comfortable. And maybe add another part time position so someone can stay on top of cleaning and monitoring the playground."

I will never take my kids here again. I will tell all of my girlfriends to stop taking their kids here because this used to be a place where I could sit and relax while my kids go and play and now I don’t trust the adults that go up and hide in the play areas. Realistically, any grown adults or teenager could walk into this building without paying and walk up into their hiding spot. This is not a safe space."

My oldest can go play on the big kid playground, but the supposedly safe space for my young toddler isn’t safe at all with the older kids jumping in the ball pit and pushing the little kids out of their way.  I wish there was a way to enforce the age restriction better, and give the young kids and their parents a safe play space.\nAlso, the last time I was there I saw not one, but two kids running around in just diapers that had a full load in them, definitely not sanitary so I pulled my kid from the toddler area."

The space is clean, and there are two large tvs with screens to view the kids in areas unseen from tables.\n\nI was impressed with the size and amount of activities, as I thought it was a lot smaller based on photos. It would be nice if there was an additional entrance through the fence, but respect the one-way in and out for safety protocol. My daughter had a blast, and the other kids that were present were nice."

The lobby with all the tables for parents is disgusting and not cleaned and all she does is sit on her phone ignoring anyone that isn’t paying to go in.

I have a lot of pros to say about this place, but only 1 major concern…\n\nThere NEEDS to be more high security in the front of the building. The staff sitting at the check- in desk need to be off their phones and pay attention to who comes in and out of the building. The gates into the play zone are not closed off, and there isn’t any sort of alarm or notification to staff when someone goes in or out the front doors. No matter where parents choose to sit and watch the kids, anything can happen in seconds with small children and they can easily go out of the gates and through the front doors without anyone even knowing. There is too much traffic outside and anybody can get hit or let alone, abducted by someone. Please please PLEASE either add a gated system to get in and out of the play zone, or get some type of alarm on the front doors that alert staff so they can be more aware of littles."

But they only setup for 24 people out of the 40. So people at my party were standing up while they were eating, and the room looked too small for even 24 people. That costed me $309 that they charged me. Plus it was $18 tax too. That was ridiculous.\n\nIt was fun, but I wouldn't recommend having a Birthday party there. Unless you have a small group."

We would come more often, but there are a lot of kids that go that are not monitored by their parents, or the parents don't care to make sure their kids respect the play place. KidsTopia hasn't been open long, and it's already falling apart. The coconut carousel is tearing at the seams and cuts legs now. One of the teacups is already broken off. Half of the balls are missing from the throw game because kids are throwing them on top of the playstructure. The game screen has been hit with hands so much that the algorithm is off and barely works anymore. We wish we had more places like this, but a handful of aggressive playing kids that don't get told \"no\" enough are going to ruin this place for the majority."

There was no notification on their website about this closure, which could have saved us the unnecessary trip. Additionally, the staff's attitude was quite rude when we expressed our frustration. I definitely do not recommend visiting without calling ahead to confirm their hours—very unprofessional management and poor customer service."

I would most definitely recommend taking your kids to Coconut Cove. Coconut Cove is by far much more cleaner and has better play toys that are very clean for kids. As well as the prices for entrance fee and food are reasonable for kids. Also the employees they have here are teenagers. We noticed they sit at the front desk too much on their phones."

We mostly like to play outside in the summers but we love that they have a trampoline we can use and lots of things to climb on. It keeps my kids entertained and they love it here. I've been here a few times and I actively watch them and follow them to make sure they are safe and I personally think it is gross. Staff are teenagers that aren't very friendly and play on their phones the entire time. The 3 times I've been there I saw someone \"clean\" once. The girl just sprayed benches people weren't sitting on without wiping them down which isn't really cleaning. I also never personally saw them clean the playground. I don't know what their cleaning expectations are but I've been to other indoor playgrounds before I moved here that had employees go into the play area every hour with spray and cloths to wipe down the equipment and it always smelled clean. We will go here again most likely but I wish their staff would actually work and make the place a clean and friendly atmosphere like I'm sure the owners expect them and pay them to do."

It might be a bit much if your kids are younger than that. Especially if you go on a busy day like spring break. If you take your toddler age kids, it's pretty likely you will find yourself climbing up the big toy to save your lost and scared kid 😂.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is the layout. I was there on a busy day, and all the seating for the parents at the front were full, so we had to sit on the side in the back. Which made it hard to watch for our kids, this resulted in one of my friends kids going outside in a panic looking for him. 🤦🏼‍♂️ We had no idea until some other mom there found him and brought him back in and helped him find us. After that we just had to stand up in the front till some seating cleared up."

The play equipment was not clean and there were a few areas that seemed unsafe, some holes in the netting, etc. The party attendees, including the birthday boy, left feeling pretty let down by the lack of rule enforcement and general mayhem. When trying to address these issues, we couldn't find a single adult employee to address these concerns. There were a few tennage-aged employees who didn't seem to know what was going on.\n\nThe real kicker in all of this, is that after we checked out with the front desk and left, they later had trouble running our card for the remaining balance due, which resulted in the owner reporting us to the Centerville Police for theft. After speaking with a police detective, we (ofcourse) paid the unpaid invoice. Needless to say, we won't ever be back to Coconut Cove again."

Our party had 4 of them. They brought out 1, then 2 more after a while, and 1 more again a bit after that. It was strange that only a small number of people were able to eat at a time. I'm not sure on cost. I didn't have to pay anything to enter as part of the party."

This is not acceptable. If a child is hurting other children staff should be allowed to ask them to leave.

But it has been a great tool in the tool belt to keep them busy in the summer, on a rainy day, or when I need a break. It keeps them entertained. We also got a similar place closer and plenty of parks and museums, but this one helps us mix things up now and then despite being farther.

          "content": "There were some fun activities for my older kiddo, but the overall feel was kind of dirty. The floors were gray, and the baby area was not very appropriate for my crawling baby. The floors were covered in crumbs and other garbage, which he naturally tried putting in his mouth. There was also like a giant soft toy the size of the wall in there that was easy for a baby to pull up on and have topple on them. There were honestly mostly older children playing in that section, even though it's only for babies. I understand that's the parent's job to watch, but I would recommend a better enclosure or something like maybe a baby gate or something? There was just a large soft block in place of a door, but my crawling baby kept climbing over it instead of playing with the other toys so I had to just stand next to him the whole time ensuring he didn't go over head first and hit his head. If it were more secure I could have at least sat down at the table right next to the baby zone instead of hovering. The other thing is that it's super difficult to see inside the play place. If parents aren't really supposed to be in there with their kids but are to watch their kids, there really needs to be some way to observe what is going on. There were multiple times I lost track of my son for several minutes just because of the layout. Maybe adding in mirrors or something to make it easier to see what is going on would make it a less stressful experience.\nI think there is great potential. I love the idea of this place. I think people should support it, and hopefully management will continue to make improvements so our kids will keep having a fun indoor space to play."

We arrived right when they opened on a Friday and by noon, the place was packed with people. It was pretty clean and I saw the one employee  wiping the play area and tables down frequently. Pretty much when she wasn't helping a customer in any way, she was cleaning. All these other reviews claiming it was dirty, I think they're just being over the top and expecting the place to look brand new and never touched, which is impossible. I did see the sit and spins that were mentioned in other reviews that had damaged padding on the corners. They were  still damaged when we went, but they didn't seem to be a safety hazard either. And all of the air guns didn't seem to be working, which was a bummer, but there's so much else to do in there so it wasn't too much of a disappointment. I would recommend grippy socks for sure after seeing many kids slip and fall in the cement flooring outside of the play area. And their pizzas are a little small, but they aren't bad for the price. They don't taste like a frozen pizza someone just tossed in the oven. We felt like we were eating a made from scratch pizza."

I had to be overly vigilant and police other people's kids.

My only critique is that because it goes so far back it’s almost impossible to watch your kid the whole time. And there are often other parents that aren’t watching their children so stuff could happen up in the play area and no adults would ever see it. Love the baby play area though! Great idea and great play set, would just love to see it separated or better view for parents towards the back to watch their kids."

I felt sick the entire time I was there, once I left the property it’s like my soul could finally breathe and I felt better within 5 minutes. This place is super tiny too. The prices on their tvs for food and drinks are wrong as we got charged more than what was advertised on the screen even after we told the lady that it’s cheaper on the screen and got a reply of “oh well we haven’t changed it yet”….  Kidstopia and Hangtime is WAY better and has way better vibes/energy. This place felt like a daycare, the whole vibe was off. Wouldn’t recommend this place."

I have toddlers so it was a bit more difficult for me bc my daughter was scared of getting hurt and she wanted to go on a the toy wheel where it spins several kids but the same big kids kept spinning for like two hours they would bump the younger kids they would even bump into the fence with their body parts flying everywhere not caring who goes near them they should have more consideration for the others around them but that’s not the businesses fault but I felt maybe they need like a worker by that station just letting them know what’s safe and what’s not bc the three workers were just in the counter chit chatting and just signing people in when someone walked and the kids looked like wild animals a lot of screaming mostly the older ones cuz they would do things without looking where they were doing or going and it would cause accidents and clashing but the place itself they have a lot of fun sections for the kids to play the toddler section was nice too especially since I did notice that was a pretty safe area bc the older kids weren’t aloud on it!"

Very reasonably priced and lots of variety of fun to be had. I brought my 1 yr old and the ball cannon sound did scare her and it is quite loud. I know it's fun but i don't think they are needed. Kids weren't even shooting the balls they were just doing it to scare the little kids and make noise. Loved that they had affordable grab and go snack options. The toddler area is a bit small but it seems a place geared for maybe 5 & up anyways. That being said I will definitely go back. Happy it wasn't busy."

This location is a ways out of our area, so it has been something I keep in the back of my mind if we're ever close by. The price has more than doubled, $10.50 now each kid no matter how long they play. 2 years old and younger play for free. I asked why the price doubled, but the girl at the front desk had only been working there a month and replied with 'inflation? I don't know when or why it changed. I'm just a teenager'. Lol\n\nUpdate: Following the business' response, I realize I was relying on what my friend had said when referring me here--and confusion occurred about the price because I didn't know whether we had paid for parents or not. Please forgive the confusion! I've kept this review to 4 stars. Kids love it if you're in the area."

          "content": "3 stars because though there are a lot of great things about it, the policies are just dumb. The staff was great, it was a fun place, pretty clean, and pretty good equipment - though it's not well lit, the drinking fountains were broken, and it was pretty cold inside. We had fun playing for my son's birthday party, but their party policies are unclear and confusing. Nowhere, when I booked the party (which includes entrance for 10 kids), did it say you can only arrive 5 minutes prior to the room reservation, which I didn't appreciate because I wanted to schedule the room for 5:00pm but couldn't because that wasn't an option (even though no one had the room booked before us) and we wanted to start the party then and play before eating pizza and cake at 6:00 (playing before eating, so kids don't get sick). It took several phone calls and convincing the manager to let us play before our room reservation (even though when we got there, there was almost no one else there). The website and signs on the door say \"No outside food or drink\", but then there is a place to eat food and the other guests I saw there were eating outside food, so it's stated everywhere but not enforced? For the party, we couldn't bring outside food (aside from the cake and water bottles), and had to order through them. BUT they only offered a couple kinds of pizza, and it turns out, they just go buy it from Marco's in Lindon. Good pizza, but why couldn't I buy it from Marco's or anywhere else myself and bring it in? Then I would've been able to have more choices than just pepperoni or cheese pizza. Plus, the staff member who went to pick it up got lost so we couldn't start our pizza party in the room until 25 minutes after our scheduled time anyway (poor kids were getting hungry). I asked if we could bring in a veggie or fruit tray (minimal mess and something healthy) and they absolutely refused saying it was against policy, but they don't offer anything healthy, just the pizza and juice boxes. I assumed they would have enough plates for us since we ordered 8 pizzas, but they only provided 10 plates for the kids (I guess adults don't get plates). I didn't know so I didn't bring our own and then they charge 50 cents a paper plate if you want any extras. It's truly wild! So yeah, the play place is safe and fun for the kids to play, but their party policies are nuts and don't make any sense, so I can't fully recommend it, for a birthday party, at least.\nAnd FYI, the party rooms are pretty small so the kids fit fine but the adults were crowded around the edges just standing with only a few able to sit."

We noticed maybe a hour in that multiple kids were eating uncrustables, then running back out into the play area, and as someone myself & with kids with severe peanut allergies it put me into panic mode instead of being able to relax and have fun, and we had to leave. They also have all over the website and doors no outside food or drinks and almost every parent in there had outside food and drinks, which just caused more worry with my kids and their allergies. Like I said it’s cute and fun and I wish we could have stayed but our trip was cut severely short because my kids safety was put at risk, it should at least be listed that kids need to wash hands before reentering play area or a suggestion to have a peanut eating zone to help navigate and include more children to play because allergies are so huge nowadays."

They have an area for three years and under, but the rules aren’t enforced. There were big kids in that small area for part for the time we were there. When we were playing in the back with the trampolines, most kids were unsupervised. My one year old had a 10 year hit her in the face a couple times with balls. Even though we were with our baby. Most of the parents were in the front socializing letting their kids run around doing whatever they want. The floors foam tiles were dirty and not cleaned. Some tiles were even overlapping and not connected causing a tripping hazards. I really wanted to like this place. :/"

The kids had fun, I love that the room was set up for the party with plates and juice boxes for the kids.\n\nHowever, we had issues with being able to order food for the party. We had reserved the date months ago, and on the website it said we would be able to order pizza through the facility, which was great because they didn’t allow any other outside food. I called the week of the party to verify the details, and they told me they wouldn’t be able to get pizza because the pizza place wouldn’t be open until the afternoon. This was frustrating because I was counting on having lunch for our guests, and if it was noted on the website or if I was made aware of this prior to the party I probably would have gone somewhere else.\n\nAlso when we got to the playground we saw that another party had brought in pizza, even though it was made clear to us that outside food wasn’t allowed, aside from cupcakes.\n\nAnyway, other than that we had a decent experience. I don’t know if I would do a birthday party again, but I might go back with my kids just for the day."

But it takes our family 25 minutes just to get here and after this, I honestly don’t know if it’s worth the drive anymore….

Like that they don’t charge the parent, and only charge the child.\n\nThings I would like the company to consider include:\n\nMost importantly- a way to ensure that those who enter with a child exit only with that child. Safety was a concern while there because there is no checking on who leaves with who. This I see as a big deal as a parent.\n\nWays to make the play area a bit more visible. The dark netting makes it challenging sometimes to see your child.\n\nHaving a separate area for different age groups. Having ages 3-12 all in one space leads to very very big kids in with little littles, often in spaces parents are not."

If that's how you run a business, accusing reviewers of things, consider business lost.\n\nI've been quite a few times, and last year the place was always managed really well. They used to have reminders to parents and children about climbing the slides, throwing things and just a general \"play nice\". We recently went back and there were too many kids being super rude, climbing the slides, pushing, throwing cars up the big slides. Parents weren't doing anything and the staff was just sitting behind the desk not doing anything too. Very frustrating, I miss when the staff would remind parents and children either over the speakers or in person about the rules. The playground itself is clean and sturdy but the staff not doing anything was really disappointing and troubling! There was a staff member there a year ago who was fun and did little reminders a year ago that was always really soft to our kids, can't remember her name but she always had fun hair colors too, we miss her. Think she quit or was fired which is disappointing. Like why fire someone who actually kept your rules up and reminded everyone about them? Or maybe she quit because it was always so hectic. I'm not sure, either way I miss the old coconut cove."

They turned off the lights and did a disco dance party for us and we had a blast. The pink slide scared the heck out of me because I'm a chicken but everything else is so fun 😝. The claw machines are the bomb because you play until you win so it doesn't feel like wasted money. I highly recommend it and it is huge and a great place for family to spend time."

It's still a fun place and cleaner than similar places but covering the trampoline and making the sleds not slide is a disappointment.\n*child is at a dead stop in photo."

The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The entire facility was clean and my kids enjoyed everything from the disco area, to the play structure (great variety) along with the $20 card that we purchased to play the claw machines (which we all got something from) and motorcycles. The biggest advantage for our family was the ability to leave and come back with our receipt for the same day without paying for re entry. We went and got lunch and were able to come back and play. Although a field trip came in and there were a lot of kids, it’s big enough to handle the crowds. Large seating area and great snacks and drink options. Card only for payment but I had read that beforehand so there were no surprises. My kids loved it and overall we spent about 3 1/2 hours here with our break. The cleanliness and friendliness, awareness of safety is what will bring me back with my kids. 10/10 would recommend."

The passes are all day so we left for lunch and were able to come back. The kids absolutely loved it. I even had a fun time playing with them. They have a toddler/infant only area, lockers for your belongings, plenty of tables and benches, a dance room, and a giant jungle gym type structure complete with slides and a mini soccer field. ALL INDOORS!!! They have three bathrooms available and small snacks for purchase. They are right but a supermarket and have two fast food restaurants in the parking lot. Great location. Great fun. Will go again."

While I was actively supervising my child, the owner stepping in and trying to correct or direct him, which felt unnecessary and overbearing.

Its niche is for younger kids (1-3) who may not be able to enjoy places like the park jungle gym just yet.\n\nFrom the outside it's pretty unassuming, but inside it's homey and welcoming. It's always clean, well kept, and the toys are fun for the kids. There are a range of healthy snacks you can buy too, which is a nice touch.\n\nFor the adults, the Wi-Fi is solid and the staff are very friendly. There are tables where you can set up and do your thing while the kids do theirs :)\n\nThey even do birthday parties! My wife and I had one for our two year old a few weeks ago, and it makes for a great venue.\n\nPricing to get in is reasonable, and if you plan on being a repeat customer, they have options to pick from to save you a little more money (including snack vouchers!).\n\nI'm so glad my wife found this little gem. To the owners and the folks who work here: thank you for being such an awesome part of the American Fork community."

After months of planning and late nights preparing decorations and food, we had an amazing 1st birthday at Layla's 🤍\nUpon arrival, I was surprised there was only one woman running the whole place alone. But she was the best; My lettered blocks got crushed in the car, while I was distracted the owner built them back together. She helped us with the balloon arch, setting up the disco light. She had her office to the side so she could still monitor the event but we still had our space per say.\nThe little neighborhood is very cute and clean, my 12 year old cousin seemed to really enjoy it and my son of course, LOVED IT. Everything was super clean and there was plenty of space for seating and decor. I improperly extended my stay, like thirty minutes past my paid time to help with clean up. Luckily we were the last event of the day, but I felt so bad. The owner was so understanding and I would totally go back when given the chance. My group was very chaotic at times and there was a lot of people decorating at one point, but I'm very grateful for the turn out.\nALSO, my son's birthday theme was \"Molang and Piupiu; Soccer Episode\" I was so scared the projector wouldn't have the right characters, but it did and it was SO cute!! She didn't have to make a birthday projector but she did and everyone loved it 🤍\n**im hoping this posts, I've had to edit it two different times lmao**"

Family reserved Layla’s for a private birthday party and on the day prior to the party, the owner cancelled the event without fully reimbursing the parents over a misunderstanding about capacity. While I understand miscommunications do happen, there is no reason to become irate and petty during a disagreement. Can’t go lower in pettiness than calling law enforcement to trespass someone cause you don’t want to return a payment after refusing the service that money was paid for… As someone that has managed quite a few private parties at venues, it is important to listen, understand and then de-escalate. Staying calm and being respectful goes a long way in customer service. Based on that, I won’t recommend this business to other family members and friends."

My whole family loves this place, both for playing and for hosting parties, and I cannot recommend them enough.\n\nNot only is the place perfect for entertaining the kiddos, the setup for birthdays is so fun and unique to any other venues. Most birthday party venues require you to do your own setup and clean up, but Layla’s workers take the time to set up for parties as well cleaning up after them! The staff is accommodating, welcoming, and kind. If you’re looking for a place to host your little one’s party look no further than Layla’s Little Neighborhood. You will not regret it!"

          "content": "About four weeks ago, I began searching for a venue to celebrate my three-year-old daughter’s birthday. After researching online, I came across Layla’s Playground. The place seemed like a good option, so I decided to visit in person to assess whether it would be a suitable location.\nWhen I arrived, I was met by a staff member (whose appearance I do not recall) and walked around with my family. I asked several key questions, including:\nI was told \"yes\" to everything, including being allowed to bring my own seating and that the event would be private. I was also advised to check their website for more details. The website confirmed that the package included 12 children, with the option to pay for additional guests, and 30 adults, again with the option to add more. Nowhere did it state a strict guest limit. Based on this information, I proceeded with my plans.\nI designed and sent out invitations, assuming everything was set. I then paid a $65 deposit followed by a $216 payment, securing my daughter’s party for Sunday, the 9th. According to their website, I was expected to drop off decorations the day before so they could assist with setup, and I could arrive 30 minutes early on the day of the party to finalize decorations.\nOn the 8th, I called the venue to confirm the details—specifically, what time I could bring my decorations, tables, and chairs. From the start, the woman who answered was hostile, raising her voice and being unprofessional. When I asked about dropping off my chairs and tables, she abruptly stated, \"We don’t allow tables and chairs.\" I was shocked because this directly contradicted what I had been told during my visit. She then claimed that the venue does not allow more than 50 guests, another restriction that was never disclosed.\nAt this point, I informed her that this was not what was communicated to me, and it was unacceptable for policies to suddenly change the day before my daughter’s birthday. I told her I would call back. My husband and I decided it was best to go in person to resolve the issue.\nWhen we arrived, the woman immediately addressed me by name, which signaled that she was already aware of the situation. I calmly pointed out that their website lacks clear information regarding guest limits and that it was misleading. Her response was defensive, claiming that I should have called for clarification, even though I had already spoken to an employee in person. I explained that it is not my responsibility to compensate for their staff’s lack of training or misinformationMy husband then asked if they had a process in place—such as a confirmation call or email—to ensure customers are aware of policies before finalizing payment. She dismissively stated, \"That’s not our job.\" At that point, we requested a refund, as they had failed to provide the agreed-upon service. Instead of handling the matter professionally, she became irate, yelling for us to \"get out\" and falsely claiming she felt \"in danger.\" She then ran to the back and locked the door, refusing to continue the conversation.\nShortly after, the police arrived. We explained the situation to them, and they were very understanding. The officer gave me a case number and advised me to dispute the charge with my bank, as the business refused to issue a refund despite failing to honor their commitments. He also acknowledged that, unfortunately, he could not enforce basic customer service etiquette.\nAs a result of this establishment’s lack of professionalism, poor communication, and outright dishonesty, my daughter’s birthday plans were ruined. I was left scrambling at the last minute to find an alternative, spending what should have been a joyful day in tears.\nThis experience has made it clear that Layla’s Playground is not a trustworthy or customer-friendly business. I will never return, and I will be advising my family and friends to avoid this place entirely. There are many other venues that actually care about their customers and provide a welcoming environment for children—this is certainly not one of them."

The venue is already well decorated and provides tablecloths, dining settings and balloons all set up. So it really gives the option to add to it as little or as much as you want, if at all. And no required clean up. All the kids are contained which made it easy for parent drop off/pick up at one entry. I really liked how kind and accommodating the owner was with her expertise. Best of all, the venue is so cute and fun! I would’ve loved a little play neighborhood like this when I was a kid. My pictures here don’t do it justice. The neighborhood buildings and green area is gorgeous and the kids wanted to keep playing there all day."

The nice thing is you can come back after nap time since they’re open until 4 and your admission is good for the whole day. The space is clean, organized with a play area and a separate snack area so there isn’t food all over the toys as we all know kids can do sometimes. They have high chairs, tables for parents to sit, lots of open ended play toys, snacks & drinks available for purchase but you can also bring your own. The owner is also the sweetest! They also offer private bday parties  after the public hours so this is a great all around play place. Definitely for a younger kid crowd. highly recommend!"

My 19 month old had a blast and probably would have stayed all day if nap time wasn’t a thing. The only reason I’m taking off a star is because even with an age limit of 6 we still ran into the issue of older kids taking over the space and my shy 19 month old just didn’t really know what to do when the older kids took toys from her, knocked her over, and wouldn’t let her play in the area they were playing in. I know it would be hard to say no older kids because many moms have toddlers and older kids but it does make it hard for the younger kids to play especially in a smaller space.\n\nThe birthday parties look super cute, if we lived closer we would definitely consider this for a birthday venue"

She allowed me to bring any food I wanted to serve, which was great! The space is always so clean, and all of our guests commented about how fun and cute of a party it was! 10/10 would recommend bringing your kiddos to play here and hosting a party here, too!"

(There's about 3 different doors that lead to the parking lot in the play area. None had alarms or anything when opened. Super scary) The one employee working there didn't implement wearing socks - even though it clearly stated you need to wear them. My daughter was pushed and smacked by other kids and being told where she could and couldn't play.\n\nSuper disappointed. Will not be back."

It is not the owners or employees fault if other kids play rough or make a mess. Kids are messy! They are going to throw toys all over the place and get things dirty or break something. It’s not the employees job to watch your children or clean up after them every single second of the time you’re there. That’s your own job as a parent to watch your own child, and clean up after them if they make a mess. Other than that, me and my baby girl will be regulars here because we truly love it!"

If you have a rough and tumble curious toddler like mine, this place might not be for you. Don’t get me wrong, my son loved it but it was very stressful for me. I felt like I was chasing him around to keep him from destroying the place. There are little grass mounds that if you pick up, have styrofoam underneath that easily flakes off. Of course my son picked it up and was interested in what was underneath. There are several doors that go straight to the road or parking lot so you have to keep a close eye if you have a curious escape artist. There is a grass bridge that is really cute but a sign says no jumping off of it. There are vertical blinds that go to the ground that my son kept kicking balls into and my baby wanted to play with. Also, just a heads up that if you bring a baby 6 months or older, you will be charged for them to get in. Usually places don’t charge admission for infants so just be aware of that. Overall it’s a super cute place but maybe not great for everyone."

I can sit at the tables while my older daughter plays in the main area, and my baby plays on the turf in front of me. The ambience is so chill and it’s never super busy when we’re there. The staff is always so sweet and friendly, and because of the lower stimulation nature of the setup, we can spend like 1.5-2 hours here when other places we get burned out after 1 hour."

We look forward to continuing to be Layla’s neighbors! ❤️"

Her party was an hour and a half and we felt rushed. Two hours would have been perfect. We did a Minnie Mouse theme party. They provide balloon center pieces on the table and a balloon arch. You can choose the colors you want. They also provide a cake and present table. They have high chairs for babies. They also have a tv where they can display a message and a picture on the screen for your party. You can drop off decorations the day before your party and they set up the party for you. The day of her party, you can arrive 30 minutes before the party to set up the food or anything else you want for your party. They left you bring your own food as long as you bring it hot. We walked in and our party was set up with all the balloons, and the decorations I dropped off the day before. This place is clean. All of the kids had so much fun playing. It was perfect for a birthday in the winter. I also didn’t know they had music playing in the room, they asked me what type of music I wanted for the party. We chose Disney music for our Minnie Mouse party. The music was such a nice touch. When it was time to sing happy birthday and do the cake. The owner had turned on happy birthday music which was so nice. We didn’t even ask for that and she just did it. So sweet. She will check on you to see if you need anything. Our match box wasn’t working, she had lighters that we were able to use to light the candle. They do a lot of the clean up after the party as well. I would definitely book a party here again in the future."

All the stuffed animals are pretty grungy, old and piling. All the battery operated toys are broken/have dead batteries and the blocks and stuff just feel grimy. (Kind of like playing with the toys at the DI)\n\nSo if this place just did an overall refresh then it would get 5 stars for sure. I love the idea and ability to chat with other moms while easily keeping an eye on the kids, and that its an indoor place is amazing."

Any question I asked a felt that I was a bother and dumb.\n\nThere wasn’t really any monitoring or checking in by staff. They were on their phones and had head phones in and were put out they had to answer questions or help."

          "content": "Management. The management/owners are GREAT! I had a problem, and they were open-minded and kind and willing to take a little criticism for improvement (more on that later). I would encourage anyone that has had a negative experience to take the time to talk directly with management FIRST before calling it \"quits\", because I promise you they WANT to improve and they don't WANT you to leave with a sour taste in your mouth! They want to learn and adapt and get better!\n\nA+ for playground layout and design. Easy for parents to navigate and it flows AROUND the existing building limitations (as a prior movie theater, this is a GREAT use of the space!)\n\nA+ for manager customer service 👍🏻\n\nC for policy consistency amongst employees. I definitely have the employees I will go to for problem resolution and employees I actively avoid 😬 Rest assured that Coconut Cove Logan is still \"new\" to town, and the inconsistencies WILL improve (when I brought it up, manager was already aware of inconsistent policy application amongst employees and detailed her plan for fixing it. Give them time! It'll happen.)\n\nHere's what I learned: The \"2 and under free with paying older sibling\" policy is a 1:1 ratio. One full-price sibling = one free 2 and under sibling. So if you have an uneven number of kids like me (ages 5, 2, 1) the second kid under 2 will be $6 admission.\n\nFor me, I have a punch pass. I like the punch pass. But the punch pass is NOT a good value if used on $6 admissions for under 2 yrs old (at least not in the current pricing structure for April 2025).\n\nSo now that I understand the policy, I'd recommend buying the punch pass for the full-price siblings (ages 3+) but pay the $6 out-of-pocket for any odd number 2-and-under younger siblings rather than using a punch on them. More bang for your buck and more chances to play at this DELIGHTFUL indoor play space!"

          "content": "We have been good, consistent customers at Coconut Cove since it opened. We’ve enjoyed the large place space and the workspace out front. We have had two birthday parties there. As we went in today, I purchased a 10 pack with the expectation that we would continue to be good customers\n\nSince it’s spring break, I’ve been playing the childcare dance all week. I had something unexpected come up at work and decided to leave for 30 minutes to deal with the problem While my 15-year-old son supervised his 13-year-old brother and 10 year-old sister and five-year-old brother. My son is responsible and has a cell phone  At some point, my 13-year-old son threw up. He made it to the bathroom, but there was a bit of a mess and responsibly went to the front desk to tell them that it would need attention. I can’t take calls at work, but my older son sat with his brother and texted me that I needed to get back as quickly as possible.\n\nThe staff was truly horrible to my children. They made all of them, even the ones who weren’t sick, come out of the play area and sit in an isolated space. When I returned, the staff member told me I was a terrible mother for leaving my children, and that “coconut Cove is not a daycare.” I apologized for making the mistake since most places around town allow a sibling who is 14 or older to watch siblings. I recall asking someone at Coconut Cove, whether or not that was the policy and being told it would be OK. Perhaps I was wrong. The worker accused me of lying and said that had never been the policy and I must’ve been breaking the rules all along to say such a thing.\n\nWhile I accept that I broke the rules, I had come as quickly as possible to fix the situation. I sent my 13-year-old son who was sick to the car. She said that was unacceptable and terrible parenting to leave a child in the car while I supervise the others play. She said that none of my family was able to stay. She made sure I knew that my family was no longer welcome at Coconut Cove. Since I had paid for 10 passes that I will no longer be able to use, I asked for a refund. She said that was out of the question and they give no refunds ever.\n\nI am exceptionally angry about the level of customer service. This could have been a very simple case of a misunderstanding. I arrived at the Coconut Cove within 20 minutes of the first message that was left on my phone by my son. I am now out $80 that I will never see again. My 15-year-old son was embarrassed and ashamed. My five-year-old is in tears because he can’t go back to one of his favorite places.\n\nAll of this over a misunderstanding. I never expected them to be a daycare. I had left an older, responsible sibling In charge. None of the children showed any signs of illness before we walked in. My son has not thrown up since that moment and has no fever. He told me he had not eaten very well today and thinks he just pushed himself too hard. He felt much better after some water and rest. I still do not understand why my well children could not play. I cannot think of any circumstance where it was appropriate to treat a customer this way. My children were respectful and did as told throughout the entire experience. Our only sin was assuming that their policy was similar to other play areas in the valley that allow older siblings as chaperones. I was more than willing to acknowledge my error and correct it by staying with my children While my childhood thrown up waited in the van.\n\nI will be filing a formal complaint with corporate."

We love using the toddler area and love that there is a dedicated space for her and other littles to play.\n\nHowever, the issue I have (and have had for awhile) is there is no monitoring by staff (and sometimes parents). There are clear rules posted everywhere and it feels like most don’t follow them. Staff are always at the front talking or on their phones. In the toddler area specifically it is bad. The rules state that kids 4 and under are the only ones allowed to play there. Every time we have gone there is always older kids and they are usually always playing rough. Now, I don’t mind if there is an older kid in there playing with a younger sibling, but often times it’s not the case. These kids are jumping off the top of the structures (which is also listed on the rules to not do), throwing blocks and other play items (like the big shell, whale, and dolphin), and are pushing kids off structures and slides. It is very frustrating as a parent because I paid to be able to have my child play in a safe environment and often times it isn’t very safe and we end up leaving early.\n\nOther than that issue, it’s a great and fun place to play!"

I know it’s just as much on me to have checked the time they close but it seems common courtesy to mention that when paying, when it’s close to closing time. Also, not sure if things were broken or just turned off because it was closing time but the air guns and tubes that suck the balls up weren’t working which made my kids sad."

          "content": "Management. The management/owners are GREAT! I had a problem, and they were open-minded and kind and willing to take a little criticism for improvement (more on that later). I would encourage anyone that has had a negative experience to take the time to talk directly with management FIRST before calling it \"quits\", because I promise you they WANT to improve and they don't WANT you to leave with a sour taste in your mouth! They want to learn and adapt and get better!\n\nA+ for playground layout and design. Easy for parents to navigate and it flows AROUND the existing building limitations (as a prior movie theater, this is a GREAT use of the space!)\n\nA+ for manager customer service 👍🏻\n\nC for policy consistency amongst employees. I definitely have the employees I will go to for problem resolution and employees I actively avoid 😬 Rest assured that Coconut Cove Logan is still \"new\" to town, and the inconsistencies WILL improve (when I brought it up, manager was already aware of inconsistent policy application amongst employees and detailed her plan for fixing it. Give them time! It'll happen.)\n\nHere's what I learned: The \"2 and under free with paying older sibling\" policy is a 1:1 ratio. One full-price sibling = one free 2 and under sibling. So if you have an uneven number of kids like me (ages 5, 2, 1) the second kid under 2 will be $6 admission.\n\nFor me, I have a punch pass. I like the punch pass. But the punch pass is NOT a good value if used on $6 admissions for under 2 yrs old (at least not in the current pricing structure for April 2025).\n\nSo now that I understand the policy, I'd recommend buying the punch pass for the full-price siblings (ages 3+) but pay the $6 out-of-pocket for any odd number 2-and-under younger siblings rather than using a punch on them. More bang for your buck and more chances to play at this DELIGHTFUL indoor play space!"

          "content": "We have been good, consistent customers at Coconut Cove since it opened. We’ve enjoyed the large place space and the workspace out front. We have had two birthday parties there. As we went in today, I purchased a 10 pack with the expectation that we would continue to be good customers\n\nSince it’s spring break, I’ve been playing the childcare dance all week. I had something unexpected come up at work and decided to leave for 30 minutes to deal with the problem While my 15-year-old son supervised his 13-year-old brother and 10 year-old sister and five-year-old brother. My son is responsible and has a cell phone  At some point, my 13-year-old son threw up. He made it to the bathroom, but there was a bit of a mess and responsibly went to the front desk to tell them that it would need attention. I can’t take calls at work, but my older son sat with his brother and texted me that I needed to get back as quickly as possible.\n\nThe staff was truly horrible to my children. They made all of them, even the ones who weren’t sick, come out of the play area and sit in an isolated space. When I returned, the staff member told me I was a terrible mother for leaving my children, and that “coconut Cove is not a daycare.” I apologized for making the mistake since most places around town allow a sibling who is 14 or older to watch siblings. I recall asking someone at Coconut Cove, whether or not that was the policy and being told it would be OK. Perhaps I was wrong. The worker accused me of lying and said that had never been the policy and I must’ve been breaking the rules all along to say such a thing.\n\nWhile I accept that I broke the rules, I had come as quickly as possible to fix the situation. I sent my 13-year-old son who was sick to the car. She said that was unacceptable and terrible parenting to leave a child in the car while I supervise the others play. She said that none of my family was able to stay. She made sure I knew that my family was no longer welcome at Coconut Cove. Since I had paid for 10 passes that I will no longer be able to use, I asked for a refund. She said that was out of the question and they give no refunds ever.\n\nI am exceptionally angry about the level of customer service. This could have been a very simple case of a misunderstanding. I arrived at the Coconut Cove within 20 minutes of the first message that was left on my phone by my son. I am now out $80 that I will never see again. My 15-year-old son was embarrassed and ashamed. My five-year-old is in tears because he can’t go back to one of his favorite places.\n\nAll of this over a misunderstanding. I never expected them to be a daycare. I had left an older, responsible sibling In charge. None of the children showed any signs of illness before we walked in. My son has not thrown up since that moment and has no fever. He told me he had not eaten very well today and thinks he just pushed himself too hard. He felt much better after some water and rest. I still do not understand why my well children could not play. I cannot think of any circumstance where it was appropriate to treat a customer this way. My children were respectful and did as told throughout the entire experience. Our only sin was assuming that their policy was similar to other play areas in the valley that allow older siblings as chaperones. I was more than willing to acknowledge my error and correct it by staying with my children While my childhood thrown up waited in the van.\n\nI will be filing a formal complaint with corporate."

We love using the toddler area and love that there is a dedicated space for her and other littles to play.\n\nHowever, the issue I have (and have had for awhile) is there is no monitoring by staff (and sometimes parents). There are clear rules posted everywhere and it feels like most don’t follow them. Staff are always at the front talking or on their phones. In the toddler area specifically it is bad. The rules state that kids 4 and under are the only ones allowed to play there. Every time we have gone there is always older kids and they are usually always playing rough. Now, I don’t mind if there is an older kid in there playing with a younger sibling, but often times it’s not the case. These kids are jumping off the top of the structures (which is also listed on the rules to not do), throwing blocks and other play items (like the big shell, whale, and dolphin), and are pushing kids off structures and slides. It is very frustrating as a parent because I paid to be able to have my child play in a safe environment and often times it isn’t very safe and we end up leaving early.\n\nOther than that issue, it’s a great and fun place to play!"

It felt pretty lame to not even be told “hey we close soon, do you still want to pay”. I know it’s just as much on me to have checked the time they close but it seems common courtesy to mention that when paying, when it’s close to closing time. Also, not sure if things were broken or just turned off because it was closing time but the air guns and tubes that suck the balls up weren’t working which made my kids sad."

We provided the decorations, cake, and water bottles. We had to order their pizza cause it was afternoon and everyone loves pizza! It was warm and delicious! We had the perfect spot for cake, pizza and presents! The kids absolutely LOVED playing! They loved the slides! The tramp! Climbing all around! It was a perfect place to get out all their wiggles! We are huge fans! Even mom and dad enjoyed the slides! We highly recommend Coconut Cove Logan for birthday parties or even just go for the day to go play! It’s perfect with this cold weather in November for the kids to have a place to run around! We will definitely be back :)!"

It's also not difficult to get around if you, as a parent, need to follow/help your child.\n\nIt is difficult to get pictures from outside the play area so I took a video walking around the inside. There are quite a few different features and a good variety for kids to play on.\n\nOverall I would recommend it for a great place to get out of the heat in the summer or cold in the winter for your kids to get out some energy."

I love that it's completely padded and has many things for them to do. It's also enclosed from the bigger kids but still in the same area so you can watch your kids of all ages while keeping the little ones from being trampled. You can also enter as a parent as they need help which I appreciate! The sack lunch was great! Super cheap and perfect for an inexpensive time out with tons of fun. Owners are super kind and care about their customers. I was pleased to see them disinfecting the area as we were there. Super clean!! We will absolutely be coming here regularly!"

They turned off the lights and did a disco dance party for us and we had a blast. The pink slide scared the heck out of me because I'm a chicken but everything else is so fun 😝. The claw machines are the bomb because you play until you win so it doesn't feel like wasted money. I highly recommend it and it is huge and a great place for family to spend time."

We mostly like to play outside in the summers but we love that they have a trampoline we can use and lots of things to climb on. It keeps my kids entertained and they love it here. I've been here a few times and I actively watch them and follow them to make sure they are safe and I personally think it is gross. Staff are teenagers that aren't very friendly and play on their phones the entire time. The 3 times I've been there I saw someone \"clean\" once. The girl just sprayed benches people weren't sitting on without wiping them down which isn't really cleaning. I also never personally saw them clean the playground. I don't know what their cleaning expectations are but I've been to other indoor playgrounds before I moved here that had employees go into the play area every hour with spray and cloths to wipe down the equipment and it always smelled clean. We will go here again most likely but I wish their staff would actually work and make the place a clean and friendly atmosphere like I'm sure the owners expect them and pay them to do."

It might be a bit much if your kids are younger than that. Especially if you go on a busy day like spring break. If you take your toddler age kids, it's pretty likely you will find yourself climbing up the big toy to save your lost and scared kid 😂.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is the layout. I was there on a busy day, and all the seating for the parents at the front were full, so we had to sit on the side in the back. Which made it hard to watch for our kids, this resulted in one of my friends kids going outside in a panic looking for him. 🤦🏼‍♂️ We had no idea until some other mom there found him and brought him back in and helped him find us. After that we just had to stand up in the front till some seating cleared up."

The play equipment was not clean and there were a few areas that seemed unsafe, some holes in the netting, etc. The party attendees, including the birthday boy, left feeling pretty let down by the lack of rule enforcement and general mayhem. When trying to address these issues, we couldn't find a single adult employee to address these concerns. There were a few tennage-aged employees who didn't seem to know what was going on.\n\nThe real kicker in all of this, is that after we checked out with the front desk and left, they later had trouble running our card for the remaining balance due, which resulted in the owner reporting us to the Centerville Police for theft. After speaking with a police detective, we (ofcourse) paid the unpaid invoice. Needless to say, we won't ever be back to Coconut Cove again."

Our party had 4 of them. They brought out 1, then 2 more after a while, and 1 more again a bit after that. It was strange that only a small number of people were able to eat at a time. I'm not sure on cost. I didn't have to pay anything to enter as part of the party."

This is not acceptable. If a child is hurting other children staff should be allowed to ask them to leave.

But it has been a great tool in the tool belt to keep them busy in the summer, on a rainy day, or when I need a break. It keeps them entertained. We also got a similar place closer and plenty of parks and museums, but this one helps us mix things up now and then despite being farther.

          "content": "There were some fun activities for my older kiddo, but the overall feel was kind of dirty. The floors were gray, and the baby area was not very appropriate for my crawling baby. The floors were covered in crumbs and other garbage, which he naturally tried putting in his mouth. There was also like a giant soft toy the size of the wall in there that was easy for a baby to pull up on and have topple on them. There were honestly mostly older children playing in that section, even though it's only for babies. I understand that's the parent's job to watch, but I would recommend a better enclosure or something like maybe a baby gate or something? There was just a large soft block in place of a door, but my crawling baby kept climbing over it instead of playing with the other toys so I had to just stand next to him the whole time ensuring he didn't go over head first and hit his head. If it were more secure I could have at least sat down at the table right next to the baby zone instead of hovering. The other thing is that it's super difficult to see inside the play place. If parents aren't really supposed to be in there with their kids but are to watch their kids, there really needs to be some way to observe what is going on. There were multiple times I lost track of my son for several minutes just because of the layout. Maybe adding in mirrors or something to make it easier to see what is going on would make it a less stressful experience.\nI think there is great potential. I love the idea of this place. I think people should support it, and hopefully management will continue to make improvements so our kids will keep having a fun indoor space to play."

We arrived right when they opened on a Friday and by noon, the place was packed with people. It was pretty clean and I saw the one employee  wiping the play area and tables down frequently. Pretty much when she wasn't helping a customer in any way, she was cleaning. All these other reviews claiming it was dirty, I think they're just being over the top and expecting the place to look brand new and never touched, which is impossible. I did see the sit and spins that were mentioned in other reviews that had damaged padding on the corners. They were  still damaged when we went, but they didn't seem to be a safety hazard either. And all of the air guns didn't seem to be working, which was a bummer, but there's so much else to do in there so it wasn't too much of a disappointment. I would recommend grippy socks for sure after seeing many kids slip and fall in the cement flooring outside of the play area. And their pizzas are a little small, but they aren't bad for the price. They don't taste like a frozen pizza someone just tossed in the oven. We felt like we were eating a made from scratch pizza."

Top 5 posted rules all broken. 1) Little to no parental supervision. 2) Socks not being worn by 25% of ALL kids everywhere. 3) Kids climbing up slides (en masse). 4) Rough play abounds. 5) Outside toys all over the place.\n\nYou have to do better, owners. I had to be overly vigilant and police other people's kids.

My only critique is that because it goes so far back it’s almost impossible to watch your kid the whole time. And there are often other parents that aren’t watching their children so stuff could happen up in the play area and no adults would ever see it. Love the baby play area though! Great idea and great play set, would just love to see it separated or better view for parents towards the back to watch their kids."

However, the interactive bracelets were super fun. The different levels were all interactive and definitely very fun and interesting even for my 3 year old. There was a play section for little littles with soft blocks to climb on and try to navigate. The only downside to that was the bigger kids would often try to come in and take those toys away and play with them. It was the only small area for smaller children and maybe a staff member could navigate that area a little better to keep little kids safe.\n\nOverall my kids had a blast and my oldest couldn't quit talking about the T rex ball shooter game! It was an awesome experience and I would definitely recommend."

My 11 year old has memorized the spots and finishes the scans pretty quickly so she isn’t quite as interested as she was at first and gets bored after a while, but the 3 and 5 year olds could stay all day. I like that there is a reservation system so that it’s not overcrowded. It has never been so crowded as to not be enjoyable. There is only one “open” entrance/exit (not counting emergency exits) so your kids can’t escape without you knowing. It’s pretty huge so you might need to follow little kids around rather than letting them roam since there are spots they might not be able to navigate by themselves. However, the stairs and ceiling are big enough that adults can get around pretty easily as well as have plenty of places to sit. Occasionally there is an attraction that is broken (the Plinko style one has never functioned while we’re there) which is unfortunate, but it’s pretty well maintained and clean.\nI don’t agree with the complaints about having to follow your kids around. It’s pretty easy to follow them around or at least find points that you can watch them. It’s way better than the Curiousity playground in that way! I’d way rather bring my kids here as far as play places go:"

It felt like a sensory nightmare, especially for younger kids. If you decide to come, bring grippy socks; or pay $3 per pair.\n\nVery little to do for toddlers. A separate toddler-friendly area downstairs would’ve made a big difference, especially for families with kids of varying ages. Awkward layout. As it stands, it's not a space where younger children can safely or comfortably play. Watch out for the gap in the floor near the baby slide…\n\nOlder kids (around 5 and up) might enjoy it once, but the experience isn’t worth repeating. Be prepared for tons of stairs—something to keep in mind if you’re bringing younger siblings, or have mobility concerns. No restroom nearby.\n\nTo top it off, customer service was disappointing. I interacted with multiple staff members, and none of them were particularly welcoming or helpful.\n\nOverall, we won’t be going back. We’ve been Thanksgiving point members for years, and this experience did not match what we are used to at other venues there…."

A couple other families checked in with us that time but by 10 o'clock it started getting crowded. We purchased the All day wrist band for an additional $1.75 but not bad, some were not working but kids were excited to tap it every time.They needed gripped socks for everyone, we brought ours but you can still purchase at check in. One hour is good enough to explore the entire playground. My older one got bored by then, so we went outside the play area to explore the Jurassic experimental lab on the other side & the gift shop. The cafe opened @ 10:30 and after a little snack from there, we went back to the play area again but it was packed by 11. We spent another 30 minutes there and kids are tired & done.  You can collect your \"little prize\" from the gift shop with your wrist band at the end."

You can bring your own grippy socks or you pay $3 each. You couldn't but them at the Jurassic jungle entrance. You had to stand in a long line that was for the museum as well.

Our toddler was not sure how to feel about most of it but enjoyed the little baby play area. It feels really safe as far as the equipment, however one star docked since some of the interactive games were already broken on our first visit and the place hasn't even been open long. It's not worth buying a wristband for the interactive games for your toddlers, and be prepared to help other younger children who can't read to complete the tasks if they want to win the prize. The prize isn't much, but it's still a fun experience, however next time we go we probably won't worry about doing that part again. Another star docked for the check in process because it wasn't clear where to go when we bought tickets ahead online, however it worked out ok. But the employee did try to charge us twice for the grip socks that I had already bought online with our tickets. Not sure why she didn't see that on her computer after literally scanning each QR code separately (4 tickets, 1 wristband, and 2 pairs socks all had their own QR code) but I had to show her our receipt to show her I already purchased them. For the price, considering you also get entry to the museum part, it's pretty fair. Overall a fun and unique experience for kids."

If you are a short parent, you will be okay, but if you are 5' 9\" or above...good luck!! I slammed my head 3 times. If you're size 18+ or very pregnant, you won't fit. If you don't follow your child through the play place, you will lose sight of them. Little kids can easily get stuck in areas they can't climb up or traverse, and then back up traffic. It's just not friendly for little ones, and the area they have for babies is not engaging enough to keep toddlers in that area. My 4 yo was not able to engage well with everything and wouldn't have had a good time if my older child hadn't been there to guide him.\nIt's expensive if you don't have a pass, wristbands aren't that great and some scanning stations don't work.\nOverall it's way too dark, too warm, and inconvenient for parents--just like any other play place. They're on par with other play mazes that you've been to, don't expect a whole lot different for this one other than it's clean... For now.\nAlso, there's no bathroom inside!!!"

Jurassic Jungle is going for more of a thematic experience with the lighting and sound, to the point of being overstimulating - just a warning if you have sensitive littles. Speaking of, there's no dedicated area for littles and the dark lighting definitely makes it difficult for them. There are many spots within the playground that weren't very well designed - any adults that have gone down the wave side and then attempted to exit the wave slide can attest to this. That being said, I can tell they did put some thought into this massive playground and tried to incorporate different elements - even if those elements are already broken or non-functional. I'm a huge fan of the free admission with our membership, just be prepared to schedule your visit several weeks out every time you want to come. The biggest issue is they create time slots for arrive time, but no time limit or depart time, therefore causing it to get extremely crowded no matter the day."

The theme is awesome and there are tons of cool dinosaurs and lighting themes throughout.\n\nCons: It is really crowded. It is too confusing and big to keep track of kids younger than 5 without being right there with them. There aren’t any cameras or anything to keep track of kids and the entrance isn’t gated off so kids could escape without the parents realizing if they get separated. It can be overwhelming.\n\nWe brought our own grip socks and we did not try the wristbands. There was plenty to do without them."

          "content": "Edit: I added one star because the venue is VERY fun for children. However the response from owner is wholly inadequate. The issue is not occupancy limitations but transparency. There is no reason when I am signed into a member account that the app should not show me clearly that I could have taken my child weeks ago if I paid extra. The app makes it falsely appear to members as if its \"sold out\" or reached capacity (see picture), but if you go in person or create a non-member account you have no issues getting same day admission for any time as long as you pay a fee (see picture). It's not actually capacity limitation, but is instead artificial limitations on the number of member admissions reserving large blocks for daily paid admissions only WITHOUT communicating that clearly to members within the app.\n\nI would have paid extra to go sooner, but was never given the option as I am always signed into my account. The pricing vs occupancy stuff is essentially lying by omission and not transparent or upfront with members. Just tell us clearly that you only allow X-number of member reservations and reserve the other XX-number of reservations for paid admission only. If you believe this is the best pricing strategy, own it and be clear, don't hide the reality from members in deceptive practices like showing different inventory depending on how you sign into the app/website.\n\n_____________\n\nAs a Thanksgiving Point member, I find it absolutely unconscionable the way that they’ve set up their reservation program for Jurassic Jungle. They’re deliberately gaslighting members who have supported Thanksgiving Point for years with pass purchases, and patronage.\n\nI foolishly thought the place was just so busy I couldn’t reserve tickets as a member without trying to schedule something over a month in advance. Meanwhile, the reality is they are charging large daily fees to nonmembers and reserving a nearly all the occupancy for same day cash pay and nonmember ticket sales only. They deliberately hide this fact from members using the account login feature. Dishonest and shameful. They can use whatever pricing structure they want, but they need to be very transparent and upfront about it with members. Not lie by obfuscation by hiding what they are doing.\n\nCome renewal time other local venues, like the zoo and aquarium, are looking like a much better choice for family passes and charitable giving."

We had our two year old and big kids were trying to push past even with myself my older daughter and my husband behind our son kids were trampling him. The layout is horrible so many dead ends instead of running together having you have to back out and let people in and out. I think it was well thought out having the gym built with plastic instead of foam as foam wears out this way they don’t have to replace parts of the gym for years but for parents it was painful to go across on your knees. We will not ever go back unfortunately they make it seem like it’s big but it only is because it has big gaps for hangout spots for parents to sit and because it goes up high it is not wide and not fun at all."

I won't go without my husband because trying to do the toddler and baby at the same time without two parents wouldn't work well. If you have independent kids or can be dedicated to younger kids, it's fun. If you have multiple little or clingy kids, pick a different venue. If you don't want to be very active playing with toddlers, pick a different venue.\n\nLess crowded at the start of the day. Gets overwhelming when crowded.\n\nI haven't done wristbands.

We did our homework and knew that we'd have to sign up in advance for free member tickets. It ended up being about a 3 week wait, which we didn't love.  Our time finally arrived today, near the end of the day (6:45 pm), which were the best tickets we could find for 6 people. Although it was late, 1 hour 15 minutes was enough time to explore everything. We brought our grippy socks from home, and my husband and I had to buy some from Jurassic Jungle for the two of us, since we never needed them at other play places. I'm okay with this because adults will likely end up walking around most of the structure and there ARE places where we could slip and fall.\n\nThere was plenty of seats for adults to sit and wait while the kiddos run around, but if you sit you WILL lose sight of your kids. It's dimly lit (great for the jungle atmosphere, not the best for safety), and the structure is built in a way that you can't see much from any point.  You have to be okay with letting them loose and hope for the best. There is one exit, so you can sit there if you're worried about any of your kids leaving the premises without your permission.   I primarily sat in the upper level seating area. My kids ages 10, 8, 6, and 3 ran all over the place. They showed up to my sitting spot from time to time, and sometimes I did a quick walk around for a kid check, it was still easy enough to find everyone and gather them to go home.\n\nWe did not buy the wristbands for the little quest thing. After our visit today, I'm not so sure our family would spend the extra money for that option, the play structure is enough for us.\n\nOverall, we loved it and Im glad we have another venue to go to with our Thanksgiving point membership. The membership was already worth it, and now we have another fun thing to do! However, we love being spontaneous and sometimes squeeze in a quick trip to Thanksgiving Point into our day, planning it weeks in advance is pretty inconvenient. I hope that eventually the novelty will wear off and then they'll open it up for free membership tickets whenever we feel like going.\n\nI also hope it doesn't break down too fast. It looks like they've already had to remove one of the guns at the T-Rex shooter thing. We struggled to get the one gun working. It did work, but it wasn't easy or reliably working.  It's too bad, because I feel like it's one of the coolest features here."

There’s plenty to do, and it keeps them entertained.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks. As members, it’s frustrating to have to book tickets so far in advance, which takes away some of the spontaneity of visiting.\n\nThe playground also isn’t very well-suited for children under 3, as there aren’t many activities geared toward younger kids, which I can see being challenging for some families with a combination of older and younger children.\n\nAnother issue is the requirement for adults to purchase special socks, even if they’re just sitting and not actively playing. This policy doesn’t make much sense and feels like an unnecessary expense, especially for members. Including socks as part of the membership or revisiting this rule would be a welcome improvement.\n\nIt would also be great if there were “member-only” times to make the experience feel more exclusive and less crowded.\n\nOverall, it’s a fun place for kids but could benefit from better perks and convenience for members. 3.5/5 stars."

While several other Thanksgiving Point venues have done a great job catering to both older and younger kids, there is almost nothing for kids 2 and under to do. Jurassic Jungle totally missed the mark here. There are a few puffy “pillows” toddlers can climb on but they are placed on level 1 and 4 right in the middle of walkways, where many kids and adults are running and walking constantly. Having a low walled off area like the curiosity museum has for infants and toddlers could have been so easy. Could still be implemented in the dark and almost completely abandoned lava level or several other areas. But as it stands I wouldn’t bring kids 2 and under here. The smallest green slide that looks like it was designed specifically for young kids, has a weird, slippery rock structure you have to climb over to get to it. Our 3 year old needs help with it every time.\n2. Unlike the rest of the Thanksgiving Point venues, children 2 and up need a ticket/paid entry. While you don’t need a ticket until 3 at any other venue. First of all it’s confusing and annoying, especially as members. Secondly, why are you charging $14 per person for a 2 year old who can’t really play here?\n3. The design is incredibly flawed. They built it into the existing layout of the imax theater and it shows in a bad way. It’s almost completely stairs, with small landings that have little to entertain. There are 4 slides in the whole place, but ease of access for an adult is zero. It wouldn’t have taken much to make at least some of the slides more accessible for small kids/adults as I’ve seen the big red multi-slide at places like Coconut Cove and Kangeroo Zoo. Those ones aren’t hard for adults or smaller kids to access. This one is.\n4. Our son’s coat was stolen when we visited right before Christmas. I know it was opening week and it was crowded but it REALLY left a sour taste in my mouth about the whole place. We’ve never had anything like this happen in the hundreds of times we’ve visited every other venue at Thanksgiving Point. So don’t bring ANYTHING of value into the building. Leave it in your car.\n2 stars because my older 2 kids had a good time since they were ok to go through the structure as long as I stayed on the level 4 landing area and they could check in with me periodically. But like other reviewers have said, if you have kids under 5, either don’t bring them or they need a 1:1 parent to child ratio. I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer, I hope you consider involving parents in the design plans in the future as simple changes in design could have made this place a lot better."

They love dinosaurs, and the playground has lots of fun features, although I made them promise to stick together since it's closed off and easy to get lost from each other (and me sitting in the bench area). I wouldn't bring kids under 4 here, or at least plan to stay right with them the whole time. It's too bad there's no room for a play area for littles near the seating area. It's also fun to have a playground to hang out at when the weather is bad.\nThe wristbands are a fun feature for older kids, although extra cost. We're members, and I'm glad the admission is included with the membership, because we wouldn't pay the asking price for this as a stand-alone experience. We did have to make reservations in advance.\nAs a sidenote, the flashing lights, images and noises were overstimulating for my autistic/adhd 9-year-old, and there are stairs everywhere, so probably not accessible for those with mobility challenges."

It was crazy busy the day we went, but the structure is huge which does spread out people a bit.  Some things that we didn't like/didn't know:\n\n• Charging for adults is dumb.  We're literally there supervising the kids.  Also hard to track your kids/kids to find you.\n•  We've only ever needed grip socks for the kids as long as we're only supervising, but they are required for everyone here.\n• The biggest gripe I have was that I have a little one (18 mo) and our friends had two 12mo twins.  While the older kids were playing, it was impossible to find a place where they could play without getting run over by the older kids.  There's that one \"hall\" at the top of the stairs by the rotating circle that had some pieces that little ones could play on, but we found that the older kids would step on the little one's hands and thankfully never fell on or ran over any of them.  Not sure why they didn't design in a small separate area for 3 and under like they have done over at the curiosity museum?  That seems to me like a smart addition since families often have a smattering of ages to accommodate.\n• Lastly, they should allow people in for 2 hour slots so it doesn't get too over-crowded.  Similar to what they do at the trampoline parks.  They say that they have to be careful for fire code, but they just let more and more people in during the day, so I don't quite understand this."

          "content": "We attended yesterday (1/2/25) and our kids enjoyed it for the most part, but if you have older kids it may not keep their attention for that long. My kids (ages 8-14) completed the wristband missions within 30 minutes and after that they’re like “ummm what do we do now.” We had to come up with games for them to play so we could at least stay for an hour. That was my kids, I know all kids are not the same. But when the kids approach the older years this may not keep their attention for long so be warned.\n\nThe structure is cool, it’s very large and there’s lots of areas for adults to sit inside. However, it is pretty dark in there and some areas are darker than others. I nearly fell off a triangle shaped step because I couldn’t see it from the main floor. And I almost took a little girl with me, luckily I caught myself and was able to grab her too before we both went down. There needs to be some reflective tape or something on steps that separate the floor from steps.\n\nI don’t think adults should be charged a full price, maybe just $5 if they go into the structure and nothing if their kids are older and don’t need supervising. I also think if the tickets are timed entry, people need to leave after a certain block of time too. It was extremely crowded in there. I felt bad for a man we met outside, he had driven from afar to bring his little boy and they wouldn’t let him in because he didn’t know he had to reserve online. With how many kids were in there I’m sure they could have sold him a ticket. Very sad.\n\nI see a lot of parents complaining that it was easy for their little ones to get lost- it does say online that this structure is better suited for older kids. So that’s your mistake if you let your little one loose alone in here, this play structure is HUGE and I’d never let a kid younger than 4 roam it alone.\n\nOverall I do think the price for kids is fair, and it is fun! Some minor improvements just need to be made."

I'm glad they're taking proper safety measures.\n\nTo those complaining that adults need to pay and that it's easy to lose your kids in this place, that's why you have to pay as an adult! You're supposed to go in with your younger kids and supervise them. It's a big playground and your 5 year old cannot and should not be going in alone. So I suggest that as the parent you put on some athletic clothing and enjoy your workout of keeping up in the jungle gym with your kids.\n\nIt's very hectic right now but that's because of how cool it is. I'm excited to keep going with my kids over the years. If I could give it 10 stars I would."

Every other venue at Thanksgiving Point is a breeze for members, you walk in and scan and you’re good. To enter here, you need a reservation. That means you need to go online and reserve from a limited number of tickets. Tickets are always sold out weeks in advance.\n\nWe got a ticket for our son since literally every other play jungle in the area is just paying for the child. After planning the whole day around it, purchasing the wristband to go with it, we get to the front and they say we all need tickets. Even the adults. There was literally only one ticket available online. After talking to several people they informed us there was literally nothing they could do to remedy the situation. According to the fire code they have to limit the number of people.\n\nNow you might think “well the fire code is the law so that makes sense”. If you don’t think about it any deeper than that, you’d be correct. However, considering that literally none of the other playground places have obvious limits, and considering that the Jurassic Jungle doesn’t give you a time limit to play, it’s ridiculous to assume they can control occupancy by selling only a certain amount of tickets.\n\nIf they sell 500 tickets per day, they can say they control occupancy by controlling time of entry, which they don’t, and provide a time to leave, which they don’t. That means in theory all 500 ticket holders could show up at the same time. Then you could say “well maybe occupancy is 500 at any given time so they planned that out” which makes sense except for the fact that if you don’t have max occupancy at the same time, you can let others in. The system in place to control occupancy is extremely flawed, outdated, frustrating, and removes any excitement there is about the new attraction.\n\nIf this is this difficult for members, I can’t imagine how frustrating it would be to pay for a ticket, show up, and have them tell you you wasted your money because they forgot to tell you the adults also need tickets.\n\nI expected more. I expected better."

Charge you for it even though you have admission. It's more of pay for our membership. When it first opened they even charged members for it, until they got a crap ton of pushback. EBT doesn't apply to anything new, their new Dino playground is $14 a kid plus make adults pay to \"watch\" your child. Family of 5 with wristbands, socks and admission is $60!!! Members are free, but not wristbands , required grip socks are not free and have to make a reservation. At this point the membership is becoming useless. Mountain America funded it. Which means they ought to make it available to more people. They use to be for the community now it's a frickin money grab. Also let's also point out the fact that practically nothing allows kids in wheelchairs to access their bigger attractions. They're pretty much confined to certain areas because of the non accessibility playground, especially in the Museum of Natural Curiosity, I struggle to bring my 4 year old Spina Bifida kid here because she gets frustrated not being able to do what her siblings get to do. This won't solve anything though, it'll get seen and they'll continue to get their money, and not change a thing."

I’ve been to similar indoor playgrounds and I’ve never had to pay for myself or have grip socks. Also, it is really hard to monitor young children, the playground itself is super closed off. Maybe adding some cameras throughout with screens where the adults sit would help. I’ve also seen this at similar playgrounds and it helps a lot. To sum it up, my kids enjoyed it, but there needs to be some definite improvements on what people are charged."

It's designed for older kids, obviously, so pretty much every parent has to go in with their child, making the playground even more crowded. My biggest issue was with the online ticketing system, which is such a joke! We made reservations ahead of time and paid for the tickets and even signed all of the waivers before we arrived, and we STILL ended up having to wait in line for forever to get in! What was the point? And they clearly only care about profit. They sold waaaaay more tickets than they should have. The place was packed and overcrowded. No exaggeration - you couldn't walk a foot in any direction without running into a child. Many children were getting lost and sobbing as workers had to help them find their parents. It's just very overstimulating and crowded. We still had fun but probably wouldn't go again unless they can figure out the ticketing and check in issues. Not to mention, EVERY PERSON going in needs grip socks, whether you're going into the playground or not. Another $3/person cash grab. Many people don't need the socks..some moms sat at the bottom nursing their infants while their older kids played but still had to have the special socks.\n\nLong story short..keep an eye on your child for every single second, bring the socks, and reserve plenty of time ahead and you should be fine, if you enjoy way overcrowded dark playgrounds"

Nonslip socks are required was the first thing we learned, but more importantly we found out that 'Without an advanced reservation, even as a member, you will be charged full price for admittance' according to the representative of the counter. She went on to explain that 'we are still trying to figure out how many guests are safe in the jungle, so we charge members full price for admission if the limited spots to reserve are full.' It was something like $14 per child and $5 per adult. I asked, so charging members is a deterrent for them to visit and limits your visitors? And how soon will you know how many people are safe in the venue? Doesn't the fire marshal need to establish that? I'm guessing the manager or supervisor behind the counter in Black stepped up immediately and tried to explain to me that Thanksgiving Point is still trying to pay for the new venue, and since it's so busy they are charging because there are safety implications if they allow too many people in. I asked her how long this will be happening, and she said advanced reservation will be required permanently going forward after I repeated my question (hmm not for a time). I asked how much time is considered advanced notice for a reservation, and she didn't understand, so I said again is an hour advanced, a day, or a year considered advanced notice of our visit? She said as long as we reserve it online it is considered advanced reservation. I also asked her to clarify why they would let people in past capacity if it's not safe. She repeated that they are trying to pay for the new venue, and they need to limit the number of people coming in. I repeated my question more clearly, I asked why they wouldn't close the venue if it's already reached 100% capacity due to the safety concerns? Why would they continually allow people to go in just because they are paying money? I was anticipating reporting them to the fire marshal immediately. She did concede that they would close the venue if it was beyond safety and they reached 100% capacity. But this confirms, they just want to charge more money even to members. This is bull crap, the venue is already paid for and they just want to charge extra money. Quite the grand opening, what a nasty and bitter taste this leaves in my mouth about Thanksgiving Point.\n\nPLEASE do not pay anything extra as a member. Drive about 10 minutes south to Coconut Cove and pay $10 for children over the age of three, $5 for children under the age of three for unlimited play all day. And join me in reserving only when it is 'free' to members who have already paid for the venue with their membership. There should be free socks at least for the grand opening.\nAbout an hour after I walked away from the counter without paying, I got a notification from their app that members need to reserve in advance. Hopefully I get through to management, what a crappy grab at more cash. I feel the same about Luminaria. Ashton Gardens is worthless during the winter, in other words it is their slow season, so they charge even more money to members to bring lights to the garden when nothing is in bloom instead of just putting up lights to encourage people to visit they charge even more money so their garden's slow season is now probably it's most profitable.}"

It's a really peaceful environment to enjoy food and beverages while your child plays with all the clean toys in the huge play space! I have yet to find another indoor play area in SLC area where this is possible. I usually order a breakfast sandwich or pancakes with bacon and a latte. The owner is so friendly, he always makes it for me and brings it to us right away. I've struggled with postpartum depression and eating, so this place has been really healing for me. Feels like home.❤️"

Kid friendly restrooms. Spacious and clean and great customer service. And did I mention it is a safe play area for little kids who didn't lose interest in the time I was there with my friend.  Been to other indoor play areas and it is so hard to chit chat and keep your eyes on your little ones.  But this place was easier to keep your kids safe while chit chatting.

It was a dark dingy place, that looked like a toy room had been moved from someone's basement after years, into a warehouse and charged you money to go play. I wouldn't ever pay for something like this if I would have known. The \"cafe\" prices are worse than Starbucks, but you aren't allowed to bring in your own food or drinks. Not to mention they follow you around and watch everything your child is doing, and cleaning up right after them or telling them not to do what they thought was fun. I wouldn't go here again unfortunately."

I felt sick the entire time I was there, once I left the property it’s like my soul could finally breathe and I felt better within 5 minutes. This place is super tiny too. The prices on their tvs for food and drinks are wrong as we got charged more than what was advertised on the screen even after we told the lady that it’s cheaper on the screen and got a reply of “oh well we haven’t changed it yet”….  Kidstopia and Hangtime is WAY better and has way better vibes/energy. This place felt like a daycare, the whole vibe was off. Wouldn’t recommend this place."

Very reasonably priced and lots of variety of fun to be had. I brought my 1 yr old and the ball cannon sound did scare her and it is quite loud. I know it's fun but i don't think they are needed. Kids weren't even shooting the balls they were just doing it to scare the little kids and make noise. Loved that they had affordable grab and go snack options. The toddler area is a bit small but it seems a place geared for maybe 5 & up anyways. That being said I will definitely go back. Happy it wasn't busy."

This location is a ways out of our area, so it has been something I keep in the back of my mind if we're ever close by. The price has more than doubled, $10.50 now each kid no matter how long they play. 2 years old and younger play for free. I asked why the price doubled, but the girl at the front desk had only been working there a month and replied with 'inflation? I don't know when or why it changed. I'm just a teenager'. Lol\n\nUpdate: Following the business' response, I realize I was relying on what my friend had said when referring me here--and confusion occurred about the price because I didn't know whether we had paid for parents or not. Please forgive the confusion! I've kept this review to 4 stars. Kids love it if you're in the area."

The staff was great, it was a fun place, pretty clean, and pretty good equipment - though it's not well lit, the drinking fountains were broken, and it was pretty cold inside. We had fun playing for my son's birthday party, but their party policies are unclear and confusing. Nowhere, when I booked the party (which includes entrance for 10 kids), did it say you can only arrive 5 minutes prior to the room reservation, which I didn't appreciate because I wanted to schedule the room for 5:00pm but couldn't because that wasn't an option (even though no one had the room booked before us) and we wanted to start the party then and play before eating pizza and cake at 6:00 (playing before eating, so kids don't get sick). It took several phone calls and convincing the manager to let us play before our room reservation (even though when we got there, there was almost no one else there). The website and signs on the door say \"No outside food or drink\", but then there is a place to eat food and the other guests I saw there were eating outside food, so it's stated everywhere but not enforced? For the party, we couldn't bring outside food (aside from the cake and water bottles), and had to order through them. BUT they only offered a couple kinds of pizza, and it turns out, they just go buy it from Marco's in Lindon. Good pizza, but why couldn't I buy it from Marco's or anywhere else myself and bring it in? Then I would've been able to have more choices than just pepperoni or cheese pizza. Plus, the staff member who went to pick it up got lost so we couldn't start our pizza party in the room until 25 minutes after our scheduled time anyway (poor kids were getting hungry). I asked if we could bring in a veggie or fruit tray (minimal mess and something healthy) and they absolutely refused saying it was against policy, but they don't offer anything healthy, just the pizza and juice boxes. I assumed they would have enough plates for us since we ordered 8 pizzas, but they only provided 10 plates for the kids (I guess adults don't get plates). I didn't know so I didn't bring our own and then they charge 50 cents a paper plate if you want any extras. It's truly wild! So yeah, the play place is safe and fun for the kids to play, but their party policies are nuts and don't make any sense, so I can't fully recommend it, for a birthday party, at least.\nAnd FYI, the party rooms are pretty small so the kids fit fine but the adults were crowded around the edges just standing with only a few able to sit."

We noticed maybe a hour in that multiple kids were eating uncrustables, then running back out into the play area, and as someone myself & with kids with severe peanut allergies it put me into panic mode instead of being able to relax and have fun, and we had to leave. They also have all over the website and doors no outside food or drinks and almost every parent in there had outside food and drinks, which just caused more worry with my kids and their allergies. Like I said it’s cute and fun and I wish we could have stayed but our trip was cut severely short because my kids safety was put at risk, it should at least be listed that kids need to wash hands before reentering play area or a suggestion to have a peanut eating zone to help navigate and include more children to play because allergies are so huge nowadays."

We couldn’t get over the smell it was terrible. It was muggy and at one point while playing I smelled poop on a fabric part of the play area. We washed our hands and left! Didn’t even last 20 mins. Please avoid this place and drive a little farther out for something better."

They have an area for three years and under, but the rules aren’t enforced. There were big kids in that small area for part for the time we were there. When we were playing in the back with the trampolines, most kids were unsupervised. My one year old had a 10 year hit her in the face a couple times with balls. Even though we were with our baby. Most of the parents were in the front socializing letting their kids run around doing whatever they want. The floors foam tiles were dirty and not cleaned. Some tiles were even overlapping and not connected causing a tripping hazards. I really wanted to like this place. :/"

The kids had fun, I love that the room was set up for the party with plates and juice boxes for the kids.\n\nHowever, we had issues with being able to order food for the party. We had reserved the date months ago, and on the website it said we would be able to order pizza through the facility, which was great because they didn’t allow any other outside food. I called the week of the party to verify the details, and they told me they wouldn’t be able to get pizza because the pizza place wouldn’t be open until the afternoon. This was frustrating because I was counting on having lunch for our guests, and if it was noted on the website or if I was made aware of this prior to the party I probably would have gone somewhere else.\n\nAlso when we got to the playground we saw that another party had brought in pizza, even though it was made clear to us that outside food wasn’t allowed, aside from cupcakes.\n\nAnyway, other than that we had a decent experience. I don’t know if I would do a birthday party again, but I might go back with my kids just for the day."

Like that they don’t charge the parent, and only charge the child.\n\nThings I would like the company to consider include:\n\nMost importantly- a way to ensure that those who enter with a child exit only with that child. Safety was a concern while there because there is no checking on who leaves with who. This I see as a big deal as a parent.\n\nWays to make the play area a bit more visible. The dark netting makes it challenging sometimes to see your child.\n\nHaving a separate area for different age groups. Having ages 3-12 all in one space leads to very very big kids in with little littles, often in spaces parents are not."

If that's how you run a business, accusing reviewers of things, consider business lost.\n\nI've been quite a few times, and last year the place was always managed really well. They used to have reminders to parents and children about climbing the slides, throwing things and just a general \"play nice\". We recently went back and there were too many kids being super rude, climbing the slides, pushing, throwing cars up the big slides. Parents weren't doing anything and the staff was just sitting behind the desk not doing anything too. Very frustrating, I miss when the staff would remind parents and children either over the speakers or in person about the rules. The playground itself is clean and sturdy but the staff not doing anything was really disappointing and troubling! There was a staff member there a year ago who was fun and did little reminders a year ago that was always really soft to our kids, can't remember her name but she always had fun hair colors too, we miss her. Think she quit or was fired which is disappointing. Like why fire someone who actually kept your rules up and reminded everyone about them? Or maybe she quit because it was always so hectic. I'm not sure, either way I miss the old coconut cove."

The space is clean, and there are two large tvs with screens to view the kids in areas unseen from tables.\n\nI was impressed with the size and amount of activities, as I thought it was a lot smaller based on photos. It would be nice if there was an additional entrance through the fence, but respect the one-way in and out for safety protocol. My daughter had a blast, and the other kids that were present were nice."

The lobby with all the tables for parents is disgusting and not cleaned and all she does is sit on her phone ignoring anyone that isn’t paying to go in. When asking questions I didn’t get any verbal response just eye rolls and finger pointing."

I have a lot of pros to say about this place, but only 1 major concern…\n\nThere NEEDS to be more high security in the front of the building. The staff sitting at the check- in desk need to be off their phones and pay attention to who comes in and out of the building. The gates into the play zone are not closed off, and there isn’t any sort of alarm or notification to staff when someone goes in or out the front doors. No matter where parents choose to sit and watch the kids, anything can happen in seconds with small children and they can easily go out of the gates and through the front doors without anyone even knowing. There is too much traffic outside and anybody can get hit or let alone, abducted by someone. Please please PLEASE either add a gated system to get in and out of the play zone, or get some type of alarm on the front doors that alert staff so they can be more aware of littles."

But they only setup for 24 people out of the 40. So people at my party were standing up while they were eating, and the room looked too small for even 24 people. That costed me $309 that they charged me. Plus it was $18 tax too. That was ridiculous.\n\nIt was fun, but I wouldn't recommend having a Birthday party there. Unless you have a small group."

We decided not to bother coming here again because the staff was confusing, not clear about prices, and other places were cheaper.\nFast forward to now, a friend told me about this place and said 1 adult is free.\nDid they really steal my money that day?

We would come more often, but there are a lot of kids that go that are not monitored by their parents, or the parents don't care to make sure their kids respect the play place. KidsTopia hasn't been open long, and it's already falling apart. The coconut carousel is tearing at the seams and cuts legs now. One of the teacups is already broken off. Half of the balls are missing from the throw game because kids are throwing them on top of the playstructure. The game screen has been hit with hands so much that the algorithm is off and barely works anymore. We wish we had more places like this, but a handful of aggressive playing kids that don't get told \"no\" enough are going to ruin this place for the majority."

We planned a special Saturday outing, driving 45 minutes, only to find that Kidstopia was unexpectedly closed for a private event. There was no notification on their website about this closure, which could have saved us the unnecessary trip. Additionally, the staff's attitude was quite rude when we expressed our frustration. I definitely do not recommend visiting without calling ahead to confirm their hours—very unprofessional management and poor customer service."

I would most definitely recommend taking your kids to Coconut Cove. Coconut Cove is by far much more cleaner and has better play toys that are very clean for kids. As well as the prices for entrance fee and food are reasonable for kids. Also the employees they have here are teenagers. We noticed they sit at the front desk too much on their phones."
