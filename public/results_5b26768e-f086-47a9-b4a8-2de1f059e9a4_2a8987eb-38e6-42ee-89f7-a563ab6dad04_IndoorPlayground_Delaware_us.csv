Wasted my time. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sarah Kaufmann ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: We had a great time visiting the Natural Nest in Newark. The facility is well kept and there are plenty of activities to range different ages. AHK has only ever played at one other in-door play park, and this one was unmatched. There are so many toys for her age, and height- she's TINY! Calming music streams through the speakers as you enjoy your play session. I loved that they offered food and beverages in the case you need one. There's an ample amount of room to store your belongings. They even have high chairs if you need to feed your little ones, and shared clogs so you don't have to enter the bathroom in just your socks! ⏎  ⏎ The only negative I have to say about this particular location is the lack of steps on the play gym. There is ramp with grip, but it's pretty steep and tough to climb while guiding a small toddler. The only other option is a climbing wall, which again, not super easy to navigate to the top with your child. ⏎  ⏎ We don't live in DE, but I would definitely recommend Natural Nest to others in the future! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Karlletha Johnson ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: My grandson had his 1st birthday party at Natural Nest.

It was hard to tell what the place actually looked like from the pictures online. Was not the space I was expecting, but nice. There was no cafe from what I could tell, even though that’s what was advertised. Even as a SAHM the hours are very minimal. We did book a DIY party but I expected at least a little help from the staff.. the only part they DID help with was to charge people for socks and then remind us when it was time to leave. Overall not a welcoming experience and I have not taken my child back but am considering going to the Middletown location which has better reviews. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Miranda Zacher ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: The employees at this location are consistently unaware of their surroundings. They allow their own children to run amuck in the facility, they do not treat visitors with kindness, and they seem to ignore any needs that arise. The bathroom had no paper towels or toilet paper, a big kid was playing on the slide and the entire structure swayed with their weight, the employees child was running around without a shirt… ⏎ Just consistently disappointing. I would not recommend either of the locations to anyone. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Navene Johnson ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: I wanted to love this facility, but unfortunately, my experience left a lot to be desired. ⏎  ⏎ We booked a last-minute DIY party, and while I appreciated their flexibility with scheduling, the turnaround time on the details was understandably short. I was asked to provide an estimated number of children, and I was told it didn’t need to be exact—just so they could ensure enough seating. ⏎  ⏎ However, on the day of the party, I was told I had to pay for the number I initially estimated. ⏎ I explained that I planned to pay at the end, once I had a final headcount. When the party ended, I again explained that fewer children attended than expected. Despite this, I was told the owner insisted I still pay for the original number, which felt unfair and inflexible. ⏎  ⏎ We also paid extra for the bubble machine, which turned out to be a complete nightmare. ⏎ Within 3–4 minutes, the first child slipped and fell due to the slippery puddles the bubbles created. I asked if the charge could be removed, as it created a safety hazard. The staff member attempted to clean it with a paper towel, which only made the mess worse. She said she would ask about the charge, but I was ultimately told I still had to pay. I then asked if we could at least move the machine to a safer location, since I was being charged for it. ⏎  ⏎ When I asked about resolving the billing issue, I was told to message someone, which I did. ⏎ Unfortunately, the person who responded directed me back to the same individual at the facility who had already said she couldn’t help me. It felt like I was being passed around without any resolution. ⏎  ⏎ To add to the frustration, our trash can was full, and I had to ask for another bag. While the young lady helping us was friendly and clearly doing her best, I feel that her supervisor failed both her and me. ⏎  ⏎ I really wanted this to be a great experience, but it ended up being more stressful than joyful. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Samantha Kelley ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Awesome experience !

Watching from their soft opening until now, you can see how much effort and work they've been putting into the facility. My son loved the playwords classes, the bluey event, holiday pizza party event and going for open play. The owner and her family are friendly and engaging. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kim Martinez ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: I was genuinely excited for Play Nest Café in Newark to open, as it’s much closer to me than the Middletown location. However, after today’s experience, I’d rather make the drive to Middletown, where the new licensed owner provides exceptional customer service. She’s attentive, passionate about her role, and goes above and beyond to ensure all families feel welcomed. Her love for what she does is clear—every child is treated fairly, and every parent feels included. That kind of atmosphere is what makes a business thrive. ⏎  ⏎ Unfortunately, Newark’s location has consistently fallen short of those standards for me. Today marked the third chance I gave this location to change my perspective, but it was yet another disappointing experience. I understand that we all have off days, especially as moms, but the consistent lack of effort to create a welcoming environment here speaks volumes. ⏎  ⏎ When my son and I arrived, the atmosphere was uninviting from the start. My son, full of excitement, was quickly met with situations that felt dismissive and unfair. Another child began snatching toys from him, and while her mother was distracted, the person in charge saw it all unfold yet chose to intervene only in favor of the other child. At one point, when my son happily tried to engage with the person in charge’s child, she physically pulled her child away from him, leaving my son visibly saddened. The lack of acknowledgment or effort to include us left me feeling incredibly uncomfortable. ⏎  ⏎ In contrast, my experience at Middletown’s Play Nest Café has always been positive, thanks to the owner’s genuine care for families and her inclusive approach. Today’s experience reinforced the importance of hiring staff who align with a business’s values and understand how to make families feel valued. Sadly, this hasn’t been my experience at Newark. ⏎  ⏎ As much as I love supporting small businesses, I cannot continue to spend my money at a location where I feel unwelcome and discriminated against, nor will I subject my son to such treatment. While the space is aesthetically pleasing, the experience simply doesn’t reflect the environment it should. If you value fairness, inclusion, and genuine customer service, I cannot recommend the Newark location. ⏎  ⏎ I got there at 12:00 pm exact and i left within 20 minutes due to how uncomfortable, depressing etc is was . ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Isaias Polanco ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: I don’t typically write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience. Today, my wife took our son to this location, and unfortunately, the staff member in charge made them feel unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout their visit. This individual repeatedly gave them unpleasant looks and displayed discriminatory behavior. ⏎  ⏎ Additionally, there were children being rude to my son, taking all the toys from him, yet the staff member failed to address the situation or remind the children that the toys are for everyone to share. ⏎  ⏎ We usually visit the Middletown location, where the service is exceptional, and the atmosphere is always welcoming. Unfortunately, this is the second time we’ve had a negative experience at this particular location, which is why I’m writing this review. I do not recommend bringing your children here due to the poor service. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jamie States ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 7 months ago ⏎ Review: I’ve only been here once and while my kids loved it they opened late the day that I went.

Honestly, especially for  $16 I really expected a clean facility for my little one to play in. The main lady who greeted us was very sweet. The place itself is definitely much smaller than i imagined and felt a little underwhelming. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jacob Rice ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: The whole family loves this place!}","Delaware","naturalnestplaycafe.com","Wheelchair accessible entrance","19711","{}"

Games were ridiculously expensive. ⏎ Should have some type of food.

There’s lots of space, so if there are many kids, everyone can spread out pretty well, but you do need to keep an eye on your children. There are some height restrictions on certain attractions, but the staff rarely enforces them, and honestly, they seem miserable and bothered if you ask them questions. The staff's attitude can vary, with some areas being closed off, but others open, though nothing really prevents anyone from climbing on certain equipment. So, supervision is important. The video games are a bit overpriced, so you can burn through money quickly. Overall, I recommend the place except for the high prices on gaming. The only downside is the staff on the floor. They seem unhappy and not very attentive to the kids. The front staff is friendly and helpful when buying tickets. As long as you're watching your kids and staying alert, it’s not a bad place to visit. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Michael Cruz ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a week ago ⏎ Review: Kids loved it great place.

All the workers appear to be high schoolers and they r all really nice and helpful. The price for both me and my sister to come here was 50$ for 90 minutes of all access play except for arcade games which r their own payment. Their was a lot of kids here when we came because their was some birthday parties but since the place is an old K-MART it’s really big inside and plenty of room to move around it don’t feel crowded at all. Honestly I was shocked by the cheap price of only 50$ and theirs so much stuff to do. I went to sky zone with my sister last year and it was like 80-90$ for 90 minutes and socks and there wasn’t hardly that much to do .

That's fine. She came over to the machine I told her wasn't working and she said ""watch""! She swiped the store card and IT DIDNT WORK! my point proven. ⏎  ⏎ She swipped the store card twice amd let us be. Fast fwd an hour, couple more employeedls came in. They opened hp the sections that you needed an employee (rope course, climbing tower, tubing).

Like how could you let a 25-year-old get on the zip line even though that’s for kids and two year old fly and doing backflips on the bounty trampolines that’s just unacceptable sky zone is much more funner than this place and the reason why I gave this to stars is because in the middle of the dodgeball arena there is a trampoline that can almost break your back This was the worst experience ever. It was only like 30 minutes long because the employees told us to leave, and some girl went up to my cousins and my cousin said I’ll get the next one, but then the girl said girls no we’re getting the next one cause you got the last one like what the heck I will never go to this placeAGAIN!!!! the pizza was good though, and some arcades didn’t even work and this is why I’ll never go to fun city again ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Michel Najera ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: RedBeardGunz ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: 🔥 … ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Shannon ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: My little girl went for the first time and we loved it.

The place is fantastic and has tons of different things to do for all ages. ⏎ We thought the place was clean and we did see staff cleaning while we were there, which is always a plus. The bathrooms were clean as well. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helped us get all settled.The ball pit was HUGE for the younger ones. There are obstacle courses, slides, climbing walls as well as much more to do there. They do sell drinks and some snacks and candy but there isn't a snack bar or really much for the adults to have while they sit and watch their children play. They have tables where you can sit but I am not sure how full they get on the weekend since we were there on a Monday. It would be nice to have more seating in different areas since the kids are always on the go and some parents would want to keep tabs on them. The pricing is a bit high, It was $30 for 2 hours of play. I would say $15-$20 for 2 hours is more reasonable. There should be an hour extension offered for an additional $10 ⏎ We will be back again though. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Oni Comegys ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 8 months ago ⏎ Review: I have 6 kiddos 13, 12, 10, 6, 4, and 2… we tried sky zone epic fail they didn’t even last an hour.

He was ecstatic and we had a great time for the first hour. My son got his foot stuck in one of the rope nets, no big deal, but he did need some help getting untangled. The woman that he asked for help, who we later confirmed is the manager, decided it would be appropriate to tell my 10 year old that what he “needed was more exercise”. Not only was this extremely unprofessional of a “child friendly” facility, but also ruined the whole experience for my son and his siblings who also heard this interaction. If I could give zero stars I would. To have this be the “highlight” he remembers from his birthday party is heartbreaking to me. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Niondah Mcneal ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: We came in with our own socks from a different Fun City.

I was coming from out of town and arrived at 1:45 PM. The party was going to start at 2 PM. The room was empty so I asked if I could put this large sheet cake I was carrying in the room on the table. I was told no! I even indicated the room was empty. I just wanted to set this cake down and I would leave the room. I was told no. I brought a four year-old with me who wanted to start playing, 10 minutes early and they told me I had to pay an extra 21.99.  I stated that I had a party which they knew for $575 so couldn't they let my four year-old jump 10 minutes early. They said no. The rudest of the staff was a kid named Ben. He looked like he was about 12, but I assume he was 16. If my boys ever spoke to me the way this boy spoke to me they would've been grounded for life. I could give many examples but I won't. I will say the party was to end at 3:45 PM which I was fully aware and plan to be out of the room by then because I did not know if they had another party beginning at four. At 3:30 Ben comes in and informs me very rudely if I don't get out and that's a direct quote by 345 he was going to charge me for an additional hour for the party room and kids. There were two other girls there both Looked like they were 16. I only dealt with one other and she was just as rude.. I see when I arrived Because I was annoyed, they wouldn't let me set the cake down and the manager appeared from the back room. She said that I could go ahead and put the cake down in the room and then promptly left and I never saw her again. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Taylor Stacy ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 4 weeks ago ⏎ Review: The maintenance is not up-kept at all. My daughter is 3, and was jumping on the kids only section. She took a step on one of the pads and fell through, landing on the ground which was not padded at all. The padding has Velcro, which wasn’t attached and had a spring missing so she fell completely to the ground…back of her neck is scratched & swollen, along with her shoulder and a  bruise on her rib area. I know it’s a jump park and accidents happen but this is just ridiculous. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: marquise garland ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Benjamin Hess ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: John J ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Good ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: liv ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Benjamin Hess ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tame Lane ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: This is an amazing place to go for just a fun little trip with your kids. ⏎ My 3 kids and I truly enjoyed the time we had they have arcade games and very clean bathrooms the music is always kid friendly.

But this facility looks run down. Broken floor tiles, worn padding on the playground equipment, broken netting. It took three tries to get the correct WiFi password but it still had an error and you can’t get on the internet. One out of three bathroom stalls had toilet paper. There was water all over the bathroom floor. The whole place felt dirty and not well kept. We tried it a second time. Half way through the kids play time we were told we had to have their brand of play sock on. This wasn’t the case on our first visit nor when we entered. We left. We will not be back. We’re also reporting several safety issues to the attorney general's office as there is not netting to prevent children from getting on top of the equipment more than 10 feet off the ground.

They went out of their way to assist me with my needs. I love the variety of food and snacks they have to offer. The music is equally appropriate for children and adults; very fun and entertaining. The only reason I didn’t give full five stars is because the section where the ball pit is and the climbing area with tunnels could use a nice cleaning. It would be helpful to maybe do a quick wipe down of that area every hour. Everything else was really nice along with excellent service. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Steve Santer ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Many previous reviews have discussed the lack of cleanliness and professionalism at this business. So my review will speak to the safety concerns I observed while my two kids were playing at the playground. ⏎  ⏎ 1. Lack of netting above equipment. All major overhead areas of an indoor playground need to have fire and rip resistant netting to keep children from climbing over the sides of the equipment and suffering injury and death from a fall. Flyover park has a lack of this netting in any of their equipment that is above ten feet high. This is a direct violation of the ASTM industry standards, the group who licenses indoor playgrounds such as ""Flyover Fun Park"". Attached photos show the lack of netting where it needs to be. ⏎  ⏎ 2. Lack of staffing for a playground of this size. When we were there, I observed four staff. One was in training, and one was behind the concession stand. I would also imagine this is what is causing the lack of cleanliness in the facility. Having this few staff means that the playground can't be correctly supervised and safety issues can't/ won't be addressed. At minimum, there should be six staff with two who are focused exclusively on children's safety. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told there wasn't one on site. This begs the question, who is in charge? ⏎  ⏎ 3. Lack of public water: My kids were thirsty and I asked about a water fountain. I was told they didn't have one, and to buy a bottle of water. I understand this is a business, but profiting off thirsty children who are forced to pay for water seems a horrible way to make money. ⏎  ⏎ Seeing the recent negative reviews shows a lack of caring about customers, but I would have hoped Flyover would care about keeping kids safe. Clearly this is not the case. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Stephanie Price ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Who ever took over management is horrible. The facility looks dirty and unkept. ⏎ Horrible customer service and inexperienced staff working. They do no allow outside food, which is ridiculous. Come to find out they order food from outside.

However, this last time I found the staff to be quite indifferent about a mysterious liquid pooled inside the castle bounce house. In my opinion they were not responsive  about any of it. In fact it remained open for the hour and a half that we were still there, allowing other children to presumably get their socks and pants wet. If you want parents to feel comfortable about bringing their children here you really need to be more proactive when it comes to safety / hygiene issues. My children and I took it upon ourselves to suggest that others stay clear. It's too bad I feel dissatisfied considering the amount of money spent there.

This place deserves zero stars. This place is a dump, not only is it dirty, the management lacks customer service. I'm honestly surprised they are in business. ⏎  ⏎ I booked this place for my son's birthday party, if you want your kids to stay hydrated, forget it. The drinks you pay for in the party package will not come out until the food comes which is after the hour of play time. You are not allowed to bring your own water in, I was told I had to take it back out to the car. There are no water fountains to use either and they do not provide courtesy waters for parties. They do this so you'll buy the $1/bottle water,  as a host that can add up if you are buying water for the whole party. I ended up taking the kids out to the car in groups so they could drink water at the car. ⏎  ⏎ Also, if you book a party room, you are not allowed to utilize the party room until after the first hour, when the food gets there. I booked it 4-6 and was told I had to leave the room until 5. Do not and I repeat DO NOT since on the bench outside the room, it is wobbly, my father-in-law almost busted himself falling off it. ⏎  ⏎ Furthermore, do not talk to your friends at the party about the issues you are having with the party, the manager, Lynn Duphily, gets really mad and immature (mockingly immature) and will kick you out. I'm glad I got my refund and they didn't get an ounce of my money. To get the refund was an event in itself. After we packed everything up and everyone is waiting in the car, I went to get my refund receipt and was told ""You'll get your refund whenever she is ready to give it to you"". We left and had an amazing party elsewhere. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: A L ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Fun place, something for all kids.

So we did and they then informed me that we could t get into the room til “3” when the pizza comes . They did let us in the room 30 minutes early to decorate. The pizza came 25 minutes late and then they were very rude at telling us to leave the room because the other party was here . We let them know the pizza was 23 minutes late and that’s why we were late leaving the too . They do not give themselves enough buffer room for pizza being late and not enough time for families to decorate. No kid wants plain paper plates ,napkins at a party.

I made it in very short notice and possibly the team didn't even know we were coming because I had sent emails trying to get information and to ask to update the party number count. No one gave us any direction about how the party was to go, just you are basically just renting the room and basic table covers plain paper plates and only forks and nothing was done beforehand thank goodness we had our own decorations.  We had 15 kids in our party that only accounted for 8 but we were the only ones there and plenty of staff who could have assisted in making things more fun for kids with direction and interaction.  You work at fun park, have fun come on! In the end it just seems no one was prepared for us and seems it would have been better to just have all our friends come without paying the extra money for the room. They did say we may could be on their commercial which would make the kids extra happy so I guess thats all that matters right? The kids had fun but wanted more time. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Angel Vazquez ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Marcia Jack ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tara Martz ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: Great for the kiddos to just run and have fun ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Brenda Wood ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mackenzie Sockriter ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 2 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Niyah Jones ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: when I went with my friend we all had so much fun ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Bill Kelleyi ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: This place is a disaster.

I'm guessing if you schedule a party there'd be food made because... there was no food ready to eat. I didn't have a problem with the music but, there were some songs that weren't clean.

She has autism level 1 and this place was great. I was hesitant because of a lot of mixed reviews. But let👏me👏tell👏you…this place is great for sensory seekers. I think a lot of bad reviews just come from parents that are either not watching their kids or others that aren’t. My daughter has no sense of spatial awareness and no sense of danger and every parent I saw was doing what they were suppose to. Parenting their kids. The staff is kind and very willing to help. I had no idea what socks would fit my kids feet and the lady was on point with all three. Loved that. And they just kind of hang back unless you need something. Loved that too. I didn’t feel that constant pressure for following a million rules while trying to let my kids have fun. ⏎ I really enjoyed this place over past experiences at sky zone. We also went on a week night so it was pretty empty. Loved that also. It was a pretty penny I will say that. On our first go around for an hour and a half plus socks it was around $80. But I will say you get a lot of bang for your buck if your kids have as much energy as mine. The arcade is good too. My husband and son enjoyed it and you can win prizes and earn points for prizes. They have lockers for your shoes for $5. And my husband tried out the cotton candy machine and it makes these really cute designs. They also sell bagged snacks and drinks which is nice after running around.

I went here recently on a weekday to check the place out. The place is bigger than Urban air and has more things to do. The prices are expensive though. I hope they open a membership soon like Urban air has. The playground is gigantic and has lots of things to do but BEWARE that the ball pit isn’t deep at all so make sure your kids don’t try to jump into it. There were only a few people here so we basically had the whole place to ourselves. It’s a great place to bring KIDS EIGHT or older because the attractions there are designed more for older kids like a zip line that you have to hold onto(Don’t worry there is foam blocks underneath so you won’t fall),a ropes course, a diving pit and a Ninja course. The trampoline area was also probably the biggest trampoline area I’ve seen. BE CAREFUL if you have little kids that like to wander off or cause mischief because many of the attractions there aren’t being monitored by staff so little kids could get in places where they shouldn't. The park also had a bobsled kind of thing that was really fun to go on. But you have to carry the bobsled up the staircase so again, if YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS, make sure that they don’t get hurt pulling it up. The place also had a dodgeball court that looked kind of small but I didn’t play in it so I don’t really know how it works. Overall this is a great place for older kids and we had a lot of fun here. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: John Kaldas ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kirsten Hurley ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: PARENTS BEWARE: ⏎ We drove an hour to bring my son here for his birthday.

As the parent who likes to play WITH my 10yo, we had a blast! Adults can do the rock walls, trampolines…the foam pits are DEEP, especially where the jumping platforms and trapeeze are- getting yourself OUT of the foam pits is a feat in and of itself!! The timed tickets are great bc it sets a limit for those who are ready to go after a couple of hours. The tickets also include EVERYTHING- rock climb, zip ⏎ lines, all of it- unlike other trampoline parks that charge extra for the extra fun stuff. The kids played hide and seek throughout the playground area and had a blast at that too. My only complaint would be that they do not have a food court- only vending machine type food- so camping out for the afternoon with a lunch break and more playtime isn’t an option (unless you purchase another timed pass) and hunger was a bit of an issue- but our time was up anyway so it all worked out.

They have an area with a blue slide and next to it is a red warp wall but kids kept trying to go down it like a slide and had to be told not to but there was no supervision there by staff members! they are still installing another slide next to those (purple) and its not ready yet but just blocked by caution tape that kids can easily ignore and get seriously hurt there! There should really be a barrier between the red and blue slide area so the top of the red cant be accessed by the climb through structure at all and there are stairs next to the purple one they are installing that can be used for the red warp wall if needed.  And all of that area is accessible from the climb thru structure. Plus that big ball pit area is only a foot deep so cant jump into it or will get hurt even just from the stairs into it. 🤦‍♀️ ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Paul Tuoni ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: Went for a bday party.

First the price is outrages, I get they are big and have a lot of activities but they for and hour and half I spent $80 for just us three, they charge the parents the same as the child which is $26 for hour and half and for my 5 years old was also $26 my 2 year old was $18 for hour and half. Then everyone needed the socks which was 3.5 each. Going in they didn’t have enough staff for the size of the place and on a Saturday, I counted about 5 in total. Big kids and small kids were playing in the same areas, the play ground for toddlers is basically a maze trap, if your little ones don’t have you with them they will get overwhelmed and start cry or lost, I basically spent the whole time looking for my 5 year old. And my anxiety level was sky high. We left after 30 min. I wouldn’t recommend for kids 5 and under but it is a really awesome place for older kids for sure. Unfortunately excuse of the cost it wouldn’t be something you do on a regular basis, just too expensive and they don’t have any discounts or memberships. Hopefully they adjust. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Catherine ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: It was really fun but these guys started to push me in this trouble there is no worker walking ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: nathan stafford ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Avery Lam ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: We have been waiting for Fun City Adventure Park to open for months!

The location is huge!!  I had really nice sidebar spaces where I could plug in while my 2 and 4-year-olds were playing!  Part of the reason I am so obsessed with the play cafe is because it is SO SAFE.  It's nearly impossible for my daredevil 2-year-old to get hurt.  My kids have so much fun!  They beg me to take them here every weekend, its so nice for them to be contained in a safe space and run and get all their giggles out.  There are different activities for different types of kids, and I have found this so accommodating.  My son is beyond active and wants to jump in the balls, climb, and go down the slide.  My daughter is quiet and reserved and loves the sand, books, and toy kitchen to play with.  This has also been a great spot for play dates and for my friends and me to enjoy any of the fun coffees or bubble teas while the kids are playing, having the time of their lives in a safe, contained space.  I seriously cannot recommend it enough! My kids have so much fun, and it is easy for me to relax, which is not usually the norm when taking my toddlers out.  We bought the class pack and that was more than worth it, especially with two kids.  The space is SO clean which is amazing!  The staff are constantly cleaning and sanitizing.  It makes me feel even more at ease.  There is nothing else quite like this in the Capital Region.

I took my son there for the first time recently where he was hurt. We were the ONLY people in there & my son started screaming crying, I was consoling him as best I could & not once did the young woman who was working turn around to see if everything was okay. My son IMMEDIATELY ended up with a huge knot on his head so I asked the woman if she had ice for me (to help the swelling) & I asked for a paper towel (to wipe his nose & tears) & she moved as slow as molasses. I had to politely ask her if she could please hurry with the paper towels & she then asked “yeah, oh did something happen to him?” -__- & I told her yes… I’m not sure how she did not catch on to that, again as we are the ONLY people in there, it’s a small and quiet place. After moving very slowly with no sense of urgency, she finallt gave me some ice wrapped in a paper towel (guess they didn’t have ice packs?) & some paper towels. I finally got my son to settle down & decided to leave to care for him further.

The staff was very unprofessional. They were still decorating  room as guests arrived  it was extremely unacceptable And had their children assisting them who were not dressed appropriately! Another staff member had a crying baby in the play area upon our arrival. ⏎  ⏎ It was evident that this party was not important to them as it was a rushed job. The decorations started to fall down. The inflatable animals kept deflating when they could have easily went to a party store or walmart to replace it. A custom sign that was purchased was no where to be found, There was no evidence of a themed activity. The staff was incompetent in orchestrating a party game and gathering the children together. This was the worst experience we have ever had and I would not recommend this business. The owner stated that they were understaffed and if so they should have arrived 2 or more hours ahead to ensure that it was taken care of when people have paid for a party! They did not make our experience enjoyable at all and did not make an effort to make sure that this party was up to standard. ⏎ They need to take time to properly train staff, replace inflatables when they are no longer working properly, buy decorations, and make sure the rugs  and play items are clean before guest arrive.

However, upon arriving at 1:45 PM, I found the store dark, doors locked, and no visible activity inside. Despite attempting to call several times, there was no answer. ⏎  ⏎ Having managed businesses for family members, I understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to closures or early closure for various reasons. However, upon checking their social media pages for any communication about an early closure, I found none. ⏎  ⏎ In an attempt to gather more information, I called their Dover location, where the person who answered provided minimal information. They mentioned that if there were no reservations past 2 PM, they may close early, despite my arrival at 1:45 PM. ⏎  ⏎ This experience highlights a lack of respect for both the company's stated hours of operation and its customers. Their website clearly states: 'Reservations are encouraged but not required for our 2-hour blocks of open play.' and 'We offer Open Play, Classes and Event reservations online to ensure you have a spot to play as we have limited play capacity. Drop in is offered on an as available basis only. Please call ahead.' Their website clearly states that reservations are encouraged but not required for open play, and drop-ins are accepted based on availability. ⏎  ⏎ After reading other reviews mentioning other inconsistencies, and considering the significant distance I traveled (nearly 30 minutes) to visit their party space, I'm disappointed and unwilling to invest further time in visiting this establishment. It's worth noting that I solely intended to see the party space before blindly booking online and had no interest of play time during this visit. I could only imagine the further disappointment if I had children eager to play with me. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Regina Becker ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Such a cute place for littles to play and explore!

I do not support this company. ⏎  ⏎ We got to check out The Nest Play Cafe during soft launch today and it was an absolute blast. You can reserve a play time online or do a drop in play, however, to guarantee your spot, I recommend booking a slot online. Each slot is a 2 hour period. There is tons for kids of multiple ages to explore and play with and since it’s in soft launch, the arrangement of the room will most likely change. There is plenty of seating around the room for caregivers and well as a whole cafe to parents of independent kids to work on their laptop or grab a coffee. There are shoe cubbies for shoes and socks are required in the play area. If you forget socks, they do sell them at the front desk. There is a whole book area for older kids to sit and read while the younger kids play. There is a family bathroom for use and there is a changing table as well as a small portable potty for kids. They even had spare diapers and pads! We can’t wait to visit again and are looking into their membership option. ⏎  ⏎ The only recommendations I would have would be a locked area for people to put purses and/diaper bags and having the play period include 2 adults and 1 child instead of charging for additional adults, to mirror similar local play places. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Megan Hann ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: While the place was fun for my two kids it was absolutely freezing.

This was my first time at this establishment and it is mainly for children up to 3 years of age even though an 6 year old would just adapt to the environment. This was a Christmas event and I must say there was nothing that I saw that stood out to be Christmas at all. My daughter was the only child wearing a Christmas hat for the Christmas theme.  I thought that Bluey would have had on a Christmas hat like shown on the website. Where was the Christmas tree? Why weren’t the owners dressed in Christmas gear as the organizers of the event because I certainly was dressed for the cause as an adult.  The activities were vague and some of the children and parents didn’t even know some activities were happening because it was unannounced and unorganized.  For the price, I thought the activities were going to be more structured according to the events that were listed.  We didn’t know that our children could make gingerbread houses until we were leaving because there was no announcement of this activity. We saw little children in the corner which prompted our children to join in which made us stay an extra 15-20 min to do this activity. There is nowhere on the website that you need grip socks to play.  It just said socks! Most people sign waivers when they get to an establishment so this should have been clear online when you check out. The children who needed socks were charged $5 for non-grip socks.  Why don’t they sell the socks that are required?  We asked for a refund only when we learned that some of our children didn’t have the proper socks to play and they were going to be denied play time with Bluey. I have been to hundreds of events and have paid high and low for my child to experience fun, however, this was not what I expected. This review is not to deter you from visiting this small business but for this business to gracefully understand and respect the review and experience of their customers in hopes to do better.

Her classes have everyone smiling ear to ear. The play place is absolutely stunning. Everything is so well thought out. The colors, the toys, the books, just the whole sensory experience. We truly needed a place like this where parents can meet similar aged children and form friendships and just get some adult interaction while the kids play. Highlight of our week.

We entered the building and we spoke with a young lady at the desk, who was being guided by this man, presumably the manager. She explained that we needed to purchase socks in addition to the entry ticket, so we purchased the one pair of socks for my daughter to play. Precisely upon completing the purchase, the man informed me that I would not be able to bring my stroller into the play area. Total deal breaker. I’m sure they’re aware that once they inform a guest that they can’t bring the stroller with them, most patrons would turn away. So they’re waiting until the purchase is complete to inform you that the stroller can’t come with you. Either change the policy or tell people before they purchase. So the play area itself had a few parts that either weren’t working, or none of the kids could figure out how to make it work. None of the workers stepped in to show a demonstration or explain. My daughter did enjoy herself, but I did not enjoy needing to carry all of my belongings around with us on top of my 22 pound baby in a car seat. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kanika Oum ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: My kids love this place.

We decided to book her birthday party for April. Fast forward 3 days before the party I call to confirm the party. The teenager working tells me they don’t have record of the party. I ask to speak with a manager. She puts me on hold then another teenager proceeds to get on the phone and is NO help, telling me there is no manager and I’ll have to call back tomorrow. Five minutes later I get a call from them with the phone number for the party manager. I call this number twice, no answer. I texted it and finally got a reply. After some back and forth the person informs me that whoever booked the party never confirmed it and they don’t have any spots available for Saturday. I booked this party 2 MONTHS in advance and I never heard from them at all after booking. I was so disappointed because we had to scramble to find something else to do from my daughter’s birthday. I am very lucky I called because we would have been extremely screwed if we showed up there on the day of the party. Honestly, they need to do better and have more adults who can assist rather than leaving it all up to teenagers. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Keisha Villiness ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: Cade was so kind and helpful ⏎ Candyland is lucky to have him as an employee ⏎ I took my nephew here, and he had a great time ⏎ I will return. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Dyamond Dean-Smart ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: My kids loved it, very fun and pretty inside. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Iesha Parker ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: Super cute, fun, for TODDLERS mostly.

However, there are grown adults playing rough in the pits. As well as throwing balls recklessly at each other. My child was hit by rough housing from an adult! The workers were in the area and did not seem to care. My daughter had a good time but the lack of etiquette ruined it for us. Would not recommend for kids under the age of 2 when it’s busy. There’s no crowd control, it gets packed, and parents aren’t careful with other children. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: andre ward ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Great place highly recommend!!! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Brittany Thorne ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Candyland Adventure is so cute.

On a Saturday afternoon there were 2 employees and approximately 40 children. They charged the maximum amount without explaining that the tokens are for games that don't actually work. There are no attendants to keep an eye on the bounce houses and they are not divided by age or height. I had to rescue our child from a inflatable snow globe that deflated, so it was essentially a giant plastic bag with kids inside. One employee watched it happening and did nothing.

We have come twice and both were very cold days and I just think for a place that is so centrally located and where there is access to a lot of public transportation that there should always be more kids.  However I think it's because it's too expensive.  Most places give you a discount after the first child. What's nice is how the 2 air hockey and 1 Foosball table are included in the gold package. But the package above gold for $10 more included 1 inflatable more that just blew balloons around but no jumping. In both packages 1 ride is included for 12 minutes which I see a lot of kids get off sooner. There are 2 basketball hoop games and 1 has balls that are all deflated and after you use your 2 coins they give you, it's $2 for maybe 2 minutes which is why it's always available.  Employees are very nice and helpful. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jasmine Arsic ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: As a new Philadelphian this was by far the funniest my daughter has had .

For $52, my two kids were left jumping around and sitting on a train (a ride that lasted a maximum of 12 minutes) — and that was it. Every other activity or toy required an additional fee. Literally everything. This place felt more like a store than an actual indoor playground. ⏎  ⏎ If you’re already at the mall and your kids want to play, it might work as a quick solution to keep them entertained. However, we drove 40 minutes for just 30 minutes of playtime, plus $11 per hour for parking. It was my first and definitely my last visit. ⏎  ⏎ Also, please lower the volume of the music.

Even if you want to try and play the games, you have to find and chase the 1 worker working there to assist you. Once he's available, he doesn't give you coins for the machine. He puts in one coin to get the machine started and then walks away. If you want to play another time, you have to track him down. By that time, you lose interest. We paid for the $20 package for 2 kids each, which was ridiculous. You're better off going to the arcade near the AMC. The toys are all overly priced and are all fake knockoffs and look terrible. Once you get on the motorized cars, you only have 12 minutes to ride in a small circle in front of the store, and the employee will watch you like a hawk making sure you don't get any extra time pass 12 mins and your not trying to get an extra ride. My daughter is 3, and she seems to enjoy the bounce house, but that's all. For the experience I've gone through, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tamara Lawrence ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Great place for kids ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sammy Khader ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Exceptional customer Service!

Every time we walk through the doors, it feels like a fresh experience. Emily and Rebecca are always so kind and welcoming, and you can tell how much time and passion Emily pours into making the space special. ⏎  ⏎ The variety of toys and activities keeps my child engaged every time we come. I love that the furniture and play areas are frequently rearranged—it keeps things exciting and new, even for regular visitors like us. They also host fun, events throughout the year. We recently attended an Easter egg hunt, and I really appreciated how thoughtfully it was set up so little ones weren’t overwhelmed. It was my daughter’s first time meeting the Easter Bunny and I am thrilled she had a positive experience. ⏎  ⏎ Sometimes there’s even a themed sensory bin or fun surprise—like the day we came in and there were balloons on the wall, which my child noticed right away. There’s a cozy, clean area for nursing mothers, complimentary coffee for parents, and a snack area with child-sized tables and chairs—such a thoughtful touch. I also love the no-shoes policy, which helps keep the space clean and comfy for the kids. ⏎  ⏎ It’s such a welcoming environment, and we always look forward to our visits.

I appreciate that toys and activities are rotated for seasons, holidays, etc. I would highly recommend open play sessions or special events to those who have kiddos 1.5 to 3 years old- this gem of a business is perfect for them and we are so lucky to have it in our community! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Maria Albano ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Hey Everyone! ⏎  ⏎ (Yes it says I’m from NJ - I was visiting family and this was their party) ⏎  ⏎ We came to The Beach House for my nephew’s birthday party.

Also the fact that there were 10 toddlers in the same room and the volume was at a 4 out of 10 I was highly impressed that something like that was even possible lol. They were so extremely engaged that everyone played so nice and quiet at each stations.

Unfortunately, today we were unable to enjoy our party with constantly being followed around by the new host to the point where she climbed up on a playground to deliver the bill mid party. There was no organization or Communication!,  to be honest We would’ve operated better without a host. it was more like being policed & rushed out the room. ⏎ And as for the  manager Yaya whom Completely lacks customer service to start with she wasn’t allowing Guest due to the fact that we paid before their arrival, we wasnt not notified  about our guest & took 5minutes for her to understand that we’re willing to pay for the xtra children, and unfortunately, she’s telling my guess it’s a $21 fee perchild yet told me right in front of them that it was a $17 fee.  the way miss yaya sat outside the party room staring through the window at 7:10 pushing for is to leave At 7:15 is when we was suppose to clean up. Remind you where the last party of the day at that point, the only party of there. We basically got treated like we were unwanted and thieves for having a birthday party. I didn’t get the assitant managers name, but she has been nothing but outstanding customer service and understanding should be the main one managing!! ⏎ I really wish I would’ve took pictures, but I was trying to enjoy my child party & like i said I would  recommend location birthday parties unless you want completely surcharged for lack of Communication & a headache. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sharee Starkes ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 6 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sarah Young ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 6 months ago ⏎ Review: Our 8 and 3 year old loved it!

The cost was $25 to jump on the 2 bounce houses, basketball game and another few arcade games ( It was the hockey puc game and I believe one more) and also to drive around on their remote dinosaurs Which she did really like. She took a dinosaur ride and then went back in for a few minutes and then wanted to ride on another dino. When we asked, we were told that we would have to pay again to ride on the other dinosaur.  Decided To leave shortly after that. In my opinion it wasn't worth the $25. It was the first play place that hasn't captured her interest for a long period of time. At other play places she would play for 2 hours or more. It would have been nice if they had a little ball pit for some of the younger kids to play in.

We were greeted by Haven, who was very energetic and nice. A lot of the guests for our party arrived late and the employees were mindful of this and allowed us to have our pizza/cake time after our designated time. We appreciated them extending that kindness. Our room was decorated nicely and I appreciated not having to add much to their standard decor. The overall play space is decent, albeit, it’s definitely on the smaller side. Our party room was meant for 10 children and 10 adults, but it was very tight and several of the adults didn’t feel comfortable coming in as it felt too cramped. For the price they charge, they should definitely allow kids to continue to play after the 2 hour party slot. They expect another $22 per child after  your $500 2-hr party… on top of that, the area remains open to the public and it gets way too crowded, especially when you have little ones. It costs about 2k to reserve the entire space. We were fortunate that it wasn’t too busy at the time we had our party but I wouldn’t bank on that being  typical experience for this place. All in all, the staff was friendly and helpful, the space was fun for small children, but definitely way too small and priced high. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Melissa Fanelle ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 weeks ago ⏎ Review: I had my son’s fifth birthday party here and from the get go I was impressed by this place. They have a pamphlet with all the party options. With the party they decorate the room- and the basic decorations they supply are absolutely stunning. I got the basic birthday package and the ballon’s and decor were amazing. They even gave us invitations with a QR code to the waiver. The park itself is a blast, very clean, and meticulously maintained. The customer service was out of this world. Anything we needed they were there at a moments notice. When they saw my son’s cake was Mario themed they surprised us with Mario coming to the party. The kids were so excited. This was a party my son will never forget and I won’t either because the customer service and entire experience was out of this world. 10/10 cannot recommend enough. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Joe DeVo ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: friendly clean and accomodating ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Matthew Gerson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: Clean environment, friendly and attentive staff.

The customer service has been consistently kind, helpful, and quick (at reception). Over the past two years the gun machine have never been working when we go. Now the machine that makes the balls pop up doesn't work. And the tube that sucks up balls also doesn't work and so that means the area where the balls collect cannot be used to make all the balls fall down. The tree swing was gone and the metal Zipline that my son lives was also broken. The floors felt sticky. I feel like this place is on the decline. I hope they get it together. It's very disappointing. We come here often because it's close to my house and the kids love it. In fairness they did still have a good time. So one star for customer service and one for the kids having a good time. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ademola Adesina ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: Nice place for kids enjoyment. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ari Winokur ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 10 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you so much for your 5-star review!

Take your child here if you want to tire him/her out. ⏎  ⏎ One of the things that stood out was the front desk employee Arnetia. You can tell she genuinely loves her job! I observed her and she treated everyone with such kindness. We came near closing time and not once did we feel rushed to leave. The entire time she kept busy mopping and cleaning (which by the way as soon as you walk in you can smell the cleanliness of the place). When she wasn’t cleaning she was happily engaging with the children making sure they were safe. It’s rare that I meet someone with such a gentle and sunny disposition. Arnetia is the kind of employee you want representing your company. I hope someone in corporate reads this.

The kids had a blast for over 2 and a half hours and there was a variety of things for all ages to do (18 months - 8 years in our group). The woman working was phenomenal in making sure the environment was clean and safe and went above and beyond in showing me a easy way to the slide for me and the littlest one to slide down together without having to climb through the whole structure. Additionally, she went out of her way to show the kids how to fill the foam ball blower so that the balls cascaded everywhere to the delight of the children. The largest play structure has a variety of passages, but all of the entrances and exits are condensed toward the front for easy viewing from the two smaller play areas where parents would accompany younger children allowing them to also keep and eye on their older ones.

It was great. Small enough that the kids can play without parents hovering. And a great variety of fun activities for the children to engage in. Love the bright colors. I would have given 5 stars, however there’s a door to nowhere next to the trampolines that many kids were confused about. And right next to that are cubbies that are not attached to the floor or anything; that, when leaned on topple over. This is a major safety hazard, especially with all of the kids running back and forth. They should take the purple cubbies next to the dirt to nowhere and block that door, which would give the cubby stability and the kids no longer have a dead end when trying to find the entrance to the trampolines. Some signs on that side saying, “this way/that way” for the entrance to the trampolines might help as well. We got trampled, bumped into or had awkward looks given by so many sweet babies who were confused as to how to get to the trampolines. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: lillian ward ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Another fake review by Alyssa grimes, we terminated you because you violated our safety protocols and rules.

What a fabulous place. By chance, I saw the sign and stopped in to check it out. Couldn't fill out the waiver fast enough to my grandson's (4 yrs.) liking. We were not disappointed. So many things to do, extremely clean, friendly staff. Music playlist was well chosen and at perfect volume---enough to hear, if listening, but not intrusive if occupied in play. No shoes for all (including adults), and slip ons available at the bathroom entrances were impressive. We happened to stop by on a Friday. ALL-day play till 8:00 at a great price. We stayed 3. If not happy with the menu, you can leave and come back. Broad hours of operation (9-8:00-except Sunday till 6:00) make it convenient for most families. ⏎  ⏎ I've only written 2 reviews online (including this one). If I could have given both higher stars, I would have. I went to their website when I returned home and was surprised to see the overall rating, UNTIL I read the reviews. Look people, Junior Playland just opened in November. They're still working out the kinks---to be expected. Refreshing to see management respond to some reviews. If you are going (by choice or necessity) on a Saturday (especially) or Sunday, of course, the place is going to be more crowded. Also, my opinion--be fair---1 bad/good review per group, then just don't go back, if not happy. Otherwise, it doesn't give an accurate overall rating. Let's face it---stuff happens. Management seemed fair in how they handled those situations. One last thing---it's the adult's responsibility to monitor their child's play. Remove them from a situation, if you don't feel comfortable. Needless to say, we'll be back often in spite of the hour ride to get there. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Keyon Harris ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: Love bringing my daughter here.

You seem to only respond on Google reviews vs. actual outreaches. On the day of the party there was not a staff member on hand above high school age to assist or address our concerns. And the following day when I stopped by to discuss, you were again not available. ⏎  ⏎ I don’t know who Ann is, but I’m sorry to hear she had a similar poor experience. ⏎  ⏎ Having your friends post fake reviews to counter actual reviews from people who had poor experiences to try and stay above a 4 star rating is a questionable business practice. ⏎  ⏎ ORIGINAL REVIEW: ⏎  ⏎ Don’t recommend them for birthdays. They jam as much possible business into 1 hour room windows which robs people of set up time for their parties and also has new parties going into unsanitized rooms. The whole process is very chaotic and disorganized and if you aren’t actively policing the time yourself, they will not be helping you. There doesn’t appear to be an actual process they follow to support birthday parties. ⏎  ⏎ They also do not have any process for crowd control. They sell two hour windows for play/parties, but they do not enforce a policy to actually ensure people leave after their window ends. This makes it unreasonably overcrowded, especially as the day goes on. Most places close for a period of time to ensure integrity of the play windows and allow parties the ability to get set up and not worry about encroaching on or being encroached on by other parties. ⏎  ⏎ Other play places in the area are better positioned for these parties, and I would recommend choosing them for your sanity and to not waste $700 on a free for all setup. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ann Vuong ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: Edited 4 months ago ⏎ Review: This place is disaster!

People were not even getting checked in nor were time slots being verified. It was absolute chaos all over the play areas ⏎  ⏎ When it was time for our party room there was zero coordination. I had to find our room myself and get all our guests into the room (they told me the wrong room number) AND THEY LOST ALL OUR FOOD AND CAKE. An employee literally walked me from party room to party room looking to see if other parties were being served and eating our food! Finally they took me down to the area behind the desk where they all proceeded to just stand there yelling at each other with no one knowing where our stuff was. Eventually I walked past the arguing employees and went to look for it myself and found it was tucked in the back of the storage area. ⏎  ⏎ Even though we were within our guest count for the package we purchased there was not enough room in our room, we had guests sitting on the floor eating pizza with their kids. Additionally, our package included juice and utensils, which we never got and had to ask for forks for our cake ourselves. ⏎  ⏎ When we asked to talk to a manager a teenager came over and said “it’s not our fault” ⏎  ⏎ Upon returning back home, we realized that an employee had collected some of the gifts from our guests when they entered but we never received them. So our daughter is now missing some of her birthday gifts. ⏎  ⏎ I was so embarrassed by this entire party and I spent the night apologizing to our guests and sending up follow up apology messages to our attendees. For how much we spent on this I cannot believe this is what we got… ⏎  ⏎ EDIT IN RESPONSE TO OWNER’S RESPONSE: ⏎ I disagree with this rebuttal, the owner was not present so I am relaying my experience. I personally was taken from room to room to look for our food while other people were having their parties (as I mentioned earlier). It was not located in five minutes and I was the one who found the food myself and had my husband personally go down to carry the cake up himself in fear of another mishap. ⏎  ⏎ I did not mention the power outage as I understand this was not in anyone’s control and all the concerns I’ve outlined occurred prior to the power outage. However, if the gifts were meant to be delivered to the room as part of set up and the power outage happened after we were in our room, then how did the power outage affect visibility of the gifts in storage? It feels like the power outage is now being used as an excuse for bad services rendered throughout the evening. ⏎  ⏎ For having spent almost $700, this was not the service i was expecting ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Felice Di Felice ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: They allow way too many people in at once putting in profit over safety and experience.

It would be nice if they closed for 30 minutes between sessions to clean because nothing was in its right spot (eg. doctor kit in play hospital, food in play store). Also the layout feels tight, there’s a spinning attraction with balls hanging from it and people trying to walk by kept getting whacked.

There are a couple things that need immediate attention like the street theme tiles do not have the film peeled so they’re super slippery which needs to be fixed asap. The outlets aren’t covered that are in reach of the toddlers and some of the corners of the shelves etc should be covered.

If you’re the kind of parent that needs to stand over your kid while they’re in a space like this, I’d recommend you stay away for a bit.

All communication with the owner leading up to the day was handled seamlessly and quickly via email or via phone call, which I greatly appreciated. ⏎  ⏎ I was set up in the back due to my larger party size, which was very spacious for kids to sit and eat and adults to sit while the kids played. ⏎  ⏎ The food was delicious.

I just want to say a LOT of children were climbing up slides creating a very dangerous situation for themselves and the children using them properly. My six year old did hurt her ankle because a child crossed over her slide climbing up while she was sliding down properly and she went into him very hard. The staff was making announcements to stop, however the same children repeatedly were not listening. They need to specifically go to these children’s parents and possibly remove the kids causing hazards if they can not listen. This should be a safe space for all kids and this was pretty disappointing it wasn’t handled better. ⏎  ⏎ This was so fun! I have kids aged 2,5&7 and there’s was something for all of them.

You can spend unlimited time here as long as you don’t leave and come back in the same day. Parents should wear socks even if you’re just going to sit at the tables bc to enter the play space beyond the lobby, you need to remove your shoes. Kids need grippy socks (available for 4.50).  It’s a shared space during birthday parties which can get busy and overwhelming. ⏎  ⏎ Please remind your kids they’re not supposed to climb up the slides and not to aim air soft guns at people’s heads/faces. These are fun available attractions but are negative experiences when there are unsupervised rambunctious kids. ⏎  ⏎ Wheezone offers snacks and drinks for purchase and asks patrons not to bring their own food in (but they’ve always let us bring our own water in).

We called a week before the party to confirm we get a private room so we could do an extensive set up. The girl took our info down and said yes I’ll have the owner send some pics so you can see how to do the setup. ⏎ Owner calls two days before the party to tell us he can’t accommodate us, gives a million excuses, blames his new staff when he should have gotten back to us well before 2 nights before our party. He made it very clear they were over booked and you could hear in his tone how stressed he was. ⏎ No more stressed then we were after he cancelled our party and we had 24 hours to find a replacement place. ⏎  ⏎ You can tell this is a new business owner and I get how stressful that can be, but he was incredibly rude and didn’t offer solutions. It was take it or leave it! We don’t usually write reviews, but this was really just a bad experience all around. ⏎ Hoping he does better in the future when issues arise. ⏎  ⏎ *Reply to the owners response* ⏎  ⏎ First and foremost, your reviews appear to be mainly from one group of people, I’ll let the consensus decide if they are there based on truth or as a favor to you from friends/family. It is widely known that reviews are an important factor for businesses, and oftentimes owners will go to lengths of fabricating reviews to make their business appear to be something it is not. And I have a tiny suspicion that more honest, and real reviews will likely be coming through soon. Just a hunch! ⏎  ⏎ And yes while it is true that I did book the party 5 days before the date we wanted, something you were so adamant in saying multiple times during one conversation, somehow implying that it was our fault for planning last minute. But certainly we don’t expect someone who is not able to take account for his actions to mention or admit it. Everything I said was factual, and yet you made no comments on those facts. But you admitted your employee spoke with you and you were supposed to return my call but you failed to do so until the day before our party. Had you reached out to us in a timely manner this would have never been an issue. Attached below is the log of when we called in to go over the extensive details for our party, to which we were told to go ahead and book, to which we did, at 11pm at night as you say. And we didn’t hear from you until right before our party. Shame on you for not taking accountability. And I don’t know a professional who would offer “prayers” in this type of situation. But, it does help establish some of your character. “Take it or leave it, or I’ll offer you prayers to portray myself as victim.” We sincerely hope you do better moving forward. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jen Kasics ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: It was a great experience booking my son's birthday at Whee Zone.

I was hesitant as it’s 20 min away and we have many local trampoline parks and fun places to go to but I caved and said I would take them.  I am so glad I did.  This place is amazing.  The fun of this park is as a parent or grandparent you can join them in their fun. There are so many obstacle courses and challenging climbs to get to many levels. The best part of the park is its entrance fee and it’s an all day pass. The value here is incredible.

We had close to 22 kids + 25 adults. The kids had an amazing time. We chose the 10am slot in the morning, and that worked out perfectly as we had the place to ourselves. It was amazing to see the parents join the fun with their kids. Everyone who came had praised the cleanliness in the kids' area. I'm sure that some of them will come back with their kids as it's a great place for kids in South Brunswick & Franklin Park neighborhood. All the parents had a place to sit while their kids had fun. Layla (hope I got the name right)was an amazing host. Layla made sure that we focused on the guests. The food (that we ordered for the adults)was amazing as well. ⏎ One suggestion to the owner: we felt Layla could've used 2 more ppl (for the no. of guests that we had) to help as needed. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: April Li ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ilker Oruc ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: It's a really fun place for the entire family, obviously for kids!

My kids love this place. We arrived early, and at first, there weren't many kids. Soon, the playspace was bustling with at least 40 or more children (possibly due to a party being hosted). Despite the crowd, the space is very spacious and doesn’t feel crowded at all. After exploring for more than 2 hours, my kids ate better than usual. ⏎  ⏎ A tip for parents: bring a pair of anti-slip socks. When young kids run fast, they may fall around the corners. ⏎  ⏎ Some advice for the owner: consider offering a punchcard in addition to the monthly membership fee.

As the first indoor play area in this region, it has set a high standard for fun and entertainment for children. ⏎  ⏎ One of the most impressive aspects of Whee Zone is the unlimited play time. Unlike other indoor play locations that impose time restrictions, Whee Zone allows kids to play to their heart's content. This is a significant advantage for parents and caregivers who want to give their children ample time to explore and enjoy. ⏎  ⏎ The play area itself is fantastic, offering a wide variety of activities and equipment that cater to different age groups. From climbing structures and slides to ball pits and interactive games, there is something for every child to enjoy. The environment is clean, well-maintained, and designed with safety in mind, providing peace of mind for parents. ⏎  ⏎ The staff at Whee Zone are friendly and attentive, ensuring that the play area is supervised and that children are safe while having fun. They also offer water for purchase at the front desk, which is convenient. However, the only downside we experienced was the non-functional drinking water fountain. This might be due to the fact that the facility is still new, and I hope it will be operational soon to provide free water access for visitors. ⏎  ⏎ Overall, Whee Zone is an amazing addition to South Brunswick. It offers a fantastic play experience with the unique benefit of unlimited play time, making it a go-to destination for families. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, safe, and engaging indoor play area for their kids. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Cory Karinja ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: My wife and I took our two year old to Whee Zone today (just opened a day or so ago) and we had a blast. The Toddler area was really nice and the ball pit was a hit with all the kids I saw playing in it. The three level structure was really cool and had great ways to climb up that were safe (there were no unexpected drops in the floor that I've seen in other indoor play parks). You go so fast in the slide in the center, I was really surprised but stopped easily and safely at the bottom from the mat on the floor. ⏎  ⏎ Overall, very impressed. I also like that this location is only minutes from my house. I spoke a little bit with the owner who gave me some background on Whee Zone. He was very nice and asked for any feedback we could give. Here's some feedback, we will definitely be back! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: shannon high ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Grand opening of a local play place. ⏎  ⏎ Pros: Location is awesome! Much needed in this area. Spacious and fair amount of seating for individuals not playing. Very cool air guns to shoot foam balls, overhead basket which can be filled with foam balls and dumped out causing a rain shower of balls that delight the kiddos.  Many areas to climb, jump, tuck away! Good visibility to caregivers below to see within the various areas. ⏎  ⏎ Discount fair for the grand opening was cool too. ⏎  ⏎ Cons: The theme fell short for me. Wild West theme with numerous images of guns blaring, cigarette smoking outlaws! There is a punching bag designed to look like beer.  An indigenous person floor standing punching bag for the kids to jump on and knock over, kick around, etc. So many children themes to choose from (animals, aquatic, cars, construction) but beer and guns. The children didn't seem to notice but I did. ⏎  ⏎ This can be remedied with a few swaps for cactus, tumble weeks, art work for wagons, dessert animals. Even outlaws without cigarettes & guns. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alaa Mohamed ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Came here today on their opening day.

It is perfect for children of many ages.  They have a toddler area where younger ones can play, climb, build, and interact together.  The main play area is incredible! It has two slides that I noticed.  One right in the center and a spiraling tube slide towards the back.  There were swings within the gym the children could swing on, a ""bug mat"" to jump on the moving bugs, and stationary air guns that shot out nerf balls.  The stationary air guns ended up being one of my granddaughter's favorites. ⏎ There was also an arcade area in the back with a cafeteria area too.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We loved the seasoning on the crust ♡ ⏎ There are massage chairs for parents or grandparents to utilize, too.  There was a room where the children could make their own stuffed animal friend. ⏎ What a wonderful place for children to be children and play together.  The facility was very clean, and everyone working there was so incredibly kind. ⏎ We will definitely be back again when my granddaughter is back in town.

I took my kids on a week day when it wasn't so busy. My 3 children were able to run about the play area and do their own separate activities and I was still able to keep up with where each of my children were. There were a few of the local regulars there when I took my children and they were very respectful young adults, they were great with children, and I honestly thought these you g adults worked at Cabin Fever judging by the way these young adults conducted themselves. It was very comforting to me, considering anytime I take my children somewhere I am the only adult present to keep up with all 3 of my children. The lady that ran the place was very helpful with getting us checked in and went above and beyond by helping me setup my first time funful membership. The place was clean, well set up, and the layout was safe... There is only 1 way in or out of the building and no blind spot areas. A parent can sit at the tables and see every part of the children's play area. The combination of safety, cleanliness, and service of Cabin Fever really impressed me and I will be taking my children back often!

They made sure they went above and beyond to make sure everything was clean and prepared! They had the complete itinerary planned, but always confirmed with me prior to calling the announcements. Everything has gone absolutely smooth as a whistle this entire experience, from the first visit until now. The pizza was delicious and my party loved it. I have never had a smoother child's birthday party!  We all really liked it especially since  the parents got to stay and play too! We got card credits for the arcade so the bigger kids (and husbands) got to have fun more their age! They even had an alcohol menu which was great for the parents! They even had their version of a build-a-bear, that wasn't there the last time we went, so it was a super great surprise!! And the kids loved it! Everyone that got the bear got a discount too! It's so clean and they seriously were so accommodating it wasn't even funny!! We will definitely be back!!! 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!! 💛💛💛💛 ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: David Pinder ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: judy Carmean ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: Good  code be better ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Natasha Simms-Henry ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kimberly Thomas ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alyssa Reed ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: Very fun.

I asked the front desk if they had any high chairs, to which they told the party host it would be another $12.99 “add-on”. Considering they had already paid almost $500 to rent the space plus $200 in pizza, I didn’t want to burden them with another unreasonable fee. Literally every restaurant in the world has high chairs available for free, so charging a “rental fee” is unreasonable. ⏎  ⏎ The website for We Rock The Spectrum says that you get 2 hours, but in reality you only get 1 hour of play time plus 1 hour for pizza/cake. In reality, this was a late afternoon party and most of the kids were done eating fairly quickly (or had already had lunch and weren’t hungry) and could’ve continued playing, but the staff did not hesitate to corral us into the small party room and tell the kids they wouldn’t be returning to the play area. ⏎  ⏎ Overall this place is very disappointing if you’re attending or hosting a birthday party. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Barbie Laird ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for your five-star review! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Catherine Rexroth ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for your five-star review! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Harvey Betts ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: New experience for me.

I have an almost 2 year old who loves to climb and let loose. I liked this place because it’s built for kids under 8 only. Its climbing areas are only 1 story tall so it’s easy to spot your child from the ground. They have great slides, ball pits, a giant sandbox and some really cool tubes. One thing I was impressed with was the cleanliness. The floor was spotless. The staff were courteous, there was even a coffee machine, not that we used it. They also had an area where they can climb a wall, build blocks, etc. It was crowded but not so much that he couldn’t enjoy himself and I didn’t lose track of him. They also had a bubble machine which was kind of cool to see go off every once in a while.

Walk ins only. Booking a party on the other hand is kinda not where I would go. The reason I say this is because the standard package we book states each additional adult is $5 more. I had over 10 adults. Upon arrival at Recess, ask the attendee at the front desk. I am going to have over 10 possible kids and 10 adults as included with my set package. I specifically ask can teenage kids who are not gonna play, who are just observers. Can they be charged as an adult? I was told by the wife owner and other associate that will be fine as long as they are 15 & over. Some how three teenagers were given a payed wristband before the rest of the younger kids came. so upon the younger kids that came later, I was told to pay the full $25 fee when I specifically request to give the payed bands to the younger kids and add the additional $5 observer fee to my remaining balance. We did come up with a resolution after 15 mins of back and forth 😒Another issue I had was the size of the room. I understand that I booked that particular size but if you see that my party has grown, I would expect that they will have moved to another room as we were the only party there on Thursday evening. Most of my guests couldn't even sit down to eat. Also, didn't like we have to wait until the second hour to go in the party room that is explained on the website, but that should be changed. ⏎  ⏎ unfortunately they do not provide any type of food for you so come with your own food or you could pay for some snacks at the concession stand, only snacks like ice cream soda chips Do not except for some chicken, pizza, or any other hot food. LOL. Please note regardless if you not playing or just have to use the restroom. To go to the back you have to remove your shoes. Another thing is I was charger a gratuity fee (that felt mandatory) when it is not stated on the site or during the booking. SMH ⏎  ⏎ Thats why I give it a four star. It was amazing other than the issue we had earlier. I am thankful for the amazing experience the children had and I definitely will take my kids back again, but only as a walk-in, I cannot do a party.

While I appreciate the clean and spacious environment, I found the pricing to be unreasonably high compared to similar play centers in the area. Given the cost, I expected a better overall experience. ⏎  ⏎ Additionally, I was surprised to find that no food options were available on-site. Many play centers offer snacks, drinks, or at least a designated area for families to eat, making visits more convenient for parents and children alike. The lack of food services significantly impacted our visit, as we had to leave earlier than planned to find a suitable dining option elsewhere. ⏎  ⏎ I wanted to bring these concerns to your attention in hopes that you might reconsider your pricing structure and improve amenities to better serve families. I would appreciate a response regarding any steps you plan to take to address these issue. I will never go here again. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Karynn Seppel ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: Amazing 2 hours+ adventures throughout this new 🆕 indoor playground.

Kids love it. But as parent, I have some concerns. First, some of the slides and área of play are not patted well. So it makes it dangerous for concussion. Also, even though the rule is not to eat or drink in the playground, there is not enough personal to reinforce it. Lastly, it will be nice if the playground games are maintained, cus some of the game are not working properly.

There is so much to do for the kids from bikes, to wall climbing, to exploring the playspace. There's a ball pit (the best part about that for this germ fearing nanny is that they have a ball cleaner! The balls get cleaned on a weekly basis i think). There are 6 different areas (7 if you include the wall with the...idk what to even call that. Remember that toy ((millennials I'm talking to you!)) That you put your hand on and it made the imprint and we would of course put our face in it? Yea they have a huge body size one of those!!). They have an area for your little crawlers with plenty for them to climb and explore. The playspace is big enough for me to get in and climb with my 3 year old. There are 3 slides and a section with a ""ball volcano!) They also have ball launchers in the upper area. It's a plenty big space for kids to run around. Oh they also have a cool light color wall!

He handled everything from start to finish and went above and beyond to ensure our friends and family had a wonderful day.  This was by far the easiest, nicest party.  We’ve been to other play places that have made parents rush in, set up/decorate in 10 minutes and then clean up and rush out.  Recess does the exact opposite — they set up and clean up.  All you have to do is show up and bring any extras you want to have, they do the rest.  The entire staff was wonderful and so accommodating.  This place is clean, the staff is knowledgeable, friendly and KIND.  I cannot recommend them enough.  All our friends and family were also so impressed.

The only thing I can say is 100/10 is that your guest are allowed to play as long as they want to but when I was taking my things to the back for the party host I heard one of them say “oh no she can’t keep bringing things in they won’t fit” just because they didn’t want to continue pushing carts but they demand you tip 10% I get they don’t remain in the room for privacy but you don’t get 1 designated host and they popped up maybe 5 times on me. I asked for napkins and only got 1 tiny pack. I had to keep running around to find a host, front desk had 1 Spanish speaker who was refusing to speak to my guest in Spanish which luckily I stood at the front and helped most of my guest. Also they didn’t help me set up anything besides push like 2 stands in, im grateful I had friends and family who helped. I will definitely be returning as a customer, but definitely not for parties.

The total for 3 kids was over $70, which is outrageously overpriced. Most places offer free entry for kids 2 years old and under, but here they charge even for 1-year-olds. Additionally, the worker automatically charged me for socks without asking if I brought my own. When I told her I had my own socks, she watched me take them out of my bag like a hawk, only to claim that the socks weren’t from their location because they didn’t have a logo—even though I had purchased them from the trumbull location before they started adding logos to their socks... She still made me buy new socks without any consideration. ⏎  ⏎ Despite my frustration, I paid the overpriced bill because my kids were excited to play. However, the experience didn’t improve. The staff micromanaged how my kids were playing and even complained when my fiancé helped our 1-year-old on the slides. It was uncomfortable and far from a pleasant outing. ⏎  ⏎ This place is way too expensive, the staff are overly strict, and it doesn’t feel family-friendly at all. Save your money and go elsewhere. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alexandra Alvarez ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: I visited today and had a great experience. The facility requires specific socks for indoor play, which is normal for places like this. The socks cost $3 and are reusable. You can pay for all-day access to play, and re-entry is allowed, which is a unique service not offered by nearby facilities. They also have a train available for an additional cost. The kids had a fantastic time, making the visit worthwhile, and I will definitely be returning. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sharee Priar ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kai Autum ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Aylina Razeq ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Thank you ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: KAM N ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 5 months ago ⏎ Review: Absolutely horrible behavior and cheap efforts to rip people off. Walked into the store, and the guy who has an attitude problem automatically adds non-slip socks to the bill. When I say my son already has them, he proceeds to say no, they have to be the orange color with the koala on them....I asked him why, what does orange color and a koala have to do with safety, the answer is well the owner tells me to do this so i do. So they are pushing 5 dollar socks to everyone regardless of any reason. I mean, i get if they just raised the price by 5 but of course, then people would not show up to play for 24 bucks when everyone else is 18 (with much better play areas).

The girl continued to follow her and hit her hard in the face until I said something . Where were her parents? Where was staff ? Second time today a boy was doing the same . My husband saw his mother, grandmother (I don’t know what she was to the boy)watch the boy hit my daughter 3 times as hard as he could in the face, not saying nothing so My husband spoke up . She went on screaming and yelling at me and my husband cuz we told the boy to stop. Long story short the person in charge his name started with a T (Truman, Terrell, Terrance) it was hard to hear inside,  took me and my husband aside while the lady continued to yell in the background.

However, a lot of the kids had taken all of the props and costumes out of the play houses and no one was collecting them so not as organized as I would’ve hoped. There was also no toilet paper in the bathroom and there were maybe a dozen ppl inside after they had been open for about 30 minutes. The biggest issue was the costume cabinets were not anchored to the wall and my toddler almost pulled one down on top of himself. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Fatemeh Ghafari ⏎ Rating: 2/5 ⏎ Time: a week ago ⏎ Review: I should say that they did not give us wristbands.

A friend recommended the location, and I booked it with ease almost six months in advance. We had a great host, Jamia. She helped unload and made suggestions as we set up. It was our first time hosting outside our home so I was not sure what to expect and likely a bit indecisive about where things should go. Jamia was clearly experienced on this front and moved us along appropriately. The party room had two tables just enough for the kiddos to sit. Parents had to stand around the room because the space was limited. ⏎ The play area was perfect for the littles and even 7 and 8 yr olds had fun. For mid-day Saturday, the place was not packed so we had ample room to spread out and be comfortable as we kept an eye on our kids. ⏎ I am pleased with the service and would recommend this to others.

By 4:56 PM—within just 40 minutes—our 5-month-old daughter’s gold anklet had gone missing. She hadn’t played in any of the activity areas; we had only walked in and out of the party room, so we knew it had to have been dropped somewhere along that short path. ⏎  ⏎ We immediately asked staff if they could check the security cameras to see if it had been dropped or picked up. They said only the owner could access the footage, which we understood but we were hoping they’d reach out quickly in case whoever picked it up was still in the building. There was no sense of urgency. They said they’d do a sweep and “keep an eye out,” but it honestly felt like the situation was brushed off. With only one other party going on and a limited timeframe, it’s hard not to feel like this could have been handled better. If this had been a medical emergency or something more serious, we’d hope for a faster response but we’re not even sure that would’ve happened. ⏎  ⏎ We’ve accepted the anklet is gone, but we’re sharing this so other families know if something goes missing, don’t expect much help in recovering it. ⏎  ⏎ Aside from that, the overall cleanliness of the facility was poor. Toys and furniture looked heavily worn and overdue for replacement. Nothing appeared freshly wiped or sanitized, which is concerning in a space full of young kids. The party room was uncomfortably hot, and while there was a party host assigned, they weren’t very involved or helpful compared to hosts we’ve had at other indoor playgrounds. Overall, the experience felt unorganized and underwhelming. ⏎  ⏎ Hopefully the owners take steps to improve both cleanliness and customer care moving forward. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sarah Worth ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 months ago ⏎ Review: I’ve hosted three parties there now for my kids.

We've been members multiple times and found it to be extremely dirty (even though it's ""closed for cleaning"" between 1-2). My mom took my kids yesterday morning when they opened at 10 a.m. and the place was completely overrun with what should have been a private birthday party and wasn't. The older kids at the birthday party were pelting balls down the slides while my two and four-year-olds were trying to play, and even after bringing it to the staff's attention, the staff only made generic announcements about ""no horseplay,"" but never did anything to stop the rowdy guests. ⏎  ⏎ My mom then asked whether they could return in the afternoon. She was told that they could in theory, but Giggles was closing at 3 p.m. (Sunday, 2/16), but she could return tomorrow since it was within 24 hours. She got there with the boys today at 10 a.m. only to find out that the location is closed on Mondays. ⏎  ⏎ Really disappointed in this location, which has so much potential but is just not worth the price of admission - $30 for two kids and one hour of play. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Rashmi Rampuria ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: We celebrated my sons birthday here and what an easy, seamless, amazing experience!

I went with my 22-month-old on a Sunday. There were two birthday parties who had older siblings. It was chaos. The ladies working the desk kept coming on the lord speaker and telling parents to supervise their kids, the structure in the front was for two and under only, and no climbing on the walls of the structures. Nobody listened. I guided my kid to the less crowded areas and avoided the spots where someone had spilled juice on the floor (especially gross when shoes aren't allowed). My daughter had so much fun, but we had to leave after an hour because I just couldn't take anymore of the screaming and running. Chuck-E-Cheese isn't even this bad. ⏎  ⏎ Management, if you have rules, enforce them. And fix the broken stuff.

The price was fair. The front desk staff had everyone leave around 12:40 to close for 1:00pm. The microphone announcer is on way to loud for such a small place. I did see them put toys back in the proper place around 12:45 but nothing sanitized . Then upon closing I seen an associate using tongs to pick up trash off the floor then picked up several toys with the same tongs. I seen a girl bleeding from a cut on her arm and nobody cleaned it up and she had on pretend clothes from the play area. Upon exiting the associates had their purses on as well as if they we leaving right after us which means no sanitation being done.

When I called the number on the confirmation email, it was for the wrong location. I was told my location would contact me a day or two before the event, but they never did. ⏎  ⏎ On the day of the party, the hostess arrived at the party start time, leaving no time to set up as guests were already arriving. They had double-booked the suite I reserved, so we were given a smaller room with an apology and a discount. ⏎  ⏎ While the setup was done quickly, and the hostess was kind, the additional hour in the playground promised in the contract was not honored. ⏎  ⏎ With 45 minutes still left, announcements were made over the microphone telling “anyone not from X party” to leave, due to another private event.

A boy around 8 years of age running in the toddler area and nearly missed my toddler in the ball pit.  He stayed in the toddler areas. Parents were not parenting and employers were not working.  All 3 employees were sitting in the front.  They should be managing the play area as well.  Saw a kid (around 7yrs old) pull on the foam that is surrounding a metal pole and no one said a thing.  I had to tell him to let it go and go play but he was adamant on pulling it off.  The place does need some TLC and better management.  Never going back.

Reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because although the rules say you MUST wear socks, some kids/adults were wearing shoes, some people were barefoot, which I think just makes the place get dirty faster. There were also kids climbing up the slides because they didn't have socks on, which is also a rule.  Overall was a great experience. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Rebecca Helgesen ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: This was a great experience for our daughter.

Caitlin was super responsive, thorough, and detail oriented. It made the party planning process seamless being that she handled basically everything (even set up and clean up) except getting us dressed and ready! We supplied our dessert of choice while everything else was handled from the playlist to decorations to food and beverage for the children down to the goody bags (which were awesome). We were also welcomed to bring anything additional including food and beverage for the adults. With the package we selected we got to choose our own unique theme and she went above and beyond to supply the decor to go with it. I also loved how we could add on several additional things from a menu had we wanted to. Everyone had a great time and we are so happy we chose to hold our party here! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Diana Johnston ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: We hosted my son’s 3rd birthday here this past weekend and honestly couldn’t have asked for a better experience! The facility itself is bright, spacious, clean, and has so many fun areas for the kids to play. We had kids from ages 8 months to 5 years and everyone had a blast. There was also plenty of space for the adults to mingle and still be able to keep an eye on the kids, which can be hard to find in other play places we’ve been to. The owner, Caitlin, and her staff were so welcoming and helpful. They ordered and set up all the decorations based on our party theme which made everything so easy. The birthday boy and all our guests had so much fun and have been talking about the party all weekend.

I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about the event.  The owners, Jesse and Caitlin, couldn't have been more accommodating.  Communication prior to the party was efficient and prompt.  They were great when I asked to bring in ""adult"" food for the mommies and daddies (instead of serving them the kid's pizza and chicken tenders) -- no problem was the response.  When I asked to bring in my own face painter and balloon artist -- no problem was the answer (they even set up a ""station"" for this!!).  When we got there, Jesse was cleaning and sanitizing the venue from a previous party -- the place was spotless when he was done!  Throughout the entire event, Jesse kept things running smoothly -- a feat when he had 25 four year old littles and approximately 35 adults partying on to celebrate our little peanut!  Sunny Day had loot bags prepared for all of our little guests so everybody left with some treats in addition to the smiles on their faces!!  Thank you Jesse and Caitlin --  this party was a huge success because of your amazing play cafe and your caring and creative hosting skills!! ⏎ We'll be back to visit and play soon!!

The booking was seamless and Caitlin kept in communication regarding theme, guest list, etc. The space is huge and I love how the adults have a space of their own for coffee/eating/talking while the kids play. There are comfy couches for parents to sit positioned perfectly throughout the play area, as well. I especially loved the section catered to the ""little"" littles! We had some guests who were not yet a year of age and they had plenty of space to crawl, sit, and play away from the big kids and the big toys. The variety of pretend play is amazing, and the equipment is top notch. My favorite part was how CLEAN Sunny Day Play Cafe is. We had previous experience at a play place in West Chester and the lack of cleanliness, itself, kept us from going back. But Sunny Day Play Cafe was so clean, even the bathrooms! Caitlin was an amazing host and literally took care of everything down to party favor bags.

It’s been like that for a few years. Also watch out as they may double book your reservation plans.  We booked a party for our daughter, sent out invitations, by the time we came to pay for it 3 days later, they had rebooked another group. Their excuse was that “they didn’t want to bother us to let us know”. So you book people, and don’t call to confirm your current guests before you change or cancel? How unethical & unprofessional of an organization, the quality of management is truly shown.  Before they reply saying “you didn’t pay the deposit”, the date & package  was confirmed, and we were told to come pay the deposit within the week.  3 days later. Reservation gone to someone else. What a joke lol. Save your time and just do a walk-in visit to this place, but just be aware everything in this facility is subpar, dirty or broken.

Unlike other playgrounds where I have to run behind my tots and I lose them from sight at every corner. ⏎ I also like that their music is not too loud because in other playgrounds that can really take away the focus from the kids as they play.

There were two ladies working there, but they seemed more interested in chatting and gossiping with each other rather than paying attention to customers. One of their children appeared to be asleep on the couch, which added to the lack of a professional atmosphere. ⏎  ⏎ The facility itself is very outdated. Most of the machines and activities are in poor condition, some were broken, others didn’t even turn on. The whole place felt quite dull, dark, and far from inviting. Cleanliness is also an issue, as everything seemed a bit worn out and not well-maintained. ⏎  ⏎ While it's not as pricey as some other places, it definitely shows in the quality. If you’re looking for a better experience, especially with a toddler, I’d recommend going across the street to Funvilla instead.

The ball pit area had food crumbs all over place and the balls looked moldy. There were wet spots all over the floor. Half the toys are broken or don't work. The arcade games are always turned off or broken. There was a child from their camp that had pee soaked pants because he needed a new diaper. And he was sitting on toys and going down the slides with pee all over his pants. I even told the owner , and they did not seem to care. The place is just gross and unsanitary.

Alex helped us get checked in and was super patient with my kiddo who didn't have the patience for the waiver. We stopped in on a whim, bought the socks which are pretty nice. The prices are fair. The place is clean. I saw people get the pizza and it's pretty big. I went with a 15 year old and 6 year old. They both had a blast. I love that they have lockers that are free, it really encourages the adults to play instead of watching their things. Also, the bathrooms have Crocs that you can slide on over the socks to run into the bathroom. It seems like a lot of well thought ideas.

We came from Fairfax because we got summer reading coupons from our public library for this place. We’re having a wonderful time. Large, clean, spacious, and something for children of all ages. Everything is winter themed. Nice temp controlled place to play during very hot/cold weather  There are separated areas for 0-2s and 2-7s, birthday party rooms, bathrooms, and a lot more. There are bar chairs, high table tops, and soft benches for adults. The staff was very kind and professional. The price includes unlimited play time.  You need to wear socks to enter (they sell them too).

It’s clean, enclosed, parents and kids wear matching wrist bands, and the music isn’t blasting amassing to the general cacophony of kids having fun. It won’t break the bank and your kids can play all day for a flat fee. All in all, much better than typical indoor playgrounds. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: John Gibson ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a week ago ⏎ Review: Dear John, ⏎  ⏎ Thank you for your fantastic rating.

The parents stepped out of the building leaving him in there unattended. While the assistant manager offered to file an incident report that wouldn’t rectify the situation took place. The only solution was if my son got hit again or the boy hit someone again he would be asked to leave. This picture is my sons face today and he’s emotional go out no because he got hit in the face. I feel like this is unacceptable and the child should be removed immediately after assaulting another child and leaving marks on their face. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Barbara Florence ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a week ago ⏎ Review: Dear Barbara, ⏎  ⏎ Thank you for your fantastic rating.

I’ve been attending this location for 8 years and have never been treated so poorly. During a birthday party, we were abruptly told to “go to the back” with no context, no courtesy, not even a simple please. If this is how a manager speaks to loyal customers, she seriously needs to take a lesson—or several—on how to speak to people with basic human decency, let alone how to usher guests back to a party room kindly. ⏎  ⏎ What made it worse was her smug, dismissive attitude. When I voiced my concern, her response was “I’m sorry you feel this way,” which is nothing more than condescending gaslighting. She repeatedly refused to offer any sort of real apology or take responsibility for her disrespectful tone. And to top it off, she wouldn’t even give her name. That says it all. ⏎  ⏎ Funny enough, the younger volunteer workers were far more professional and respectful than the actual manager. If this is how management operates now, Sensory Beans has seriously lost its way. Do better. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: maria dimaria ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Unknown Guart (R19) ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 months ago ⏎ Review: It was a great place to take your children to unleash all that energy!

I showed the young girl my email and how it showed they canceled my session n code only to have her tell me that it isn't coming up on their end. I'm standing there showing her exactly what they sent me stating it was canceled with no refund n code only to have her tell me again that there is nothing she can do about it cause it isn't coming up on her end.  The young girl went to call the owner and was on the phone for a while. When she came back she said the same thing. I asked her how I could go about speaking to the owner and if she had a phone number I could call but she said she couldn't give that out then I Asked for the owners name and she wouldn't even give me that. At one point the young girl said to me "" Miss if this is gonna continue  I'm gonna have to ask you to leave"" my tone was not loud and I even apologized to her for   taking up so much of her time and she is threatening to have me leave. So disappointed, the owner should of spoken with me, this is her place of business and she should of  handled  this situation in a more professional manner.  The young girl even admitted to me that my email did show everything, the code, the cancellation  but she couldnt do anything cause it wasnt coming up on their end. I'm just flabbergasted that the owner refused to speak with me. I wasn't yelling or acting out of sorts, just trying to understand  what was going on. I will never go there again.  Ended up taking the kids to childrens social club in rockville center after and they had a blast. The owner there is a gem. Just a tip for those who plan to visit sensory beans do not follow their clock on the wall as it is 10 mins ahead. I mentioned this to them several times and it still hasn't been fixed. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kirten Mehta ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 4 months ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Alexandria Blanco ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 9 months ago ⏎ Review: Omg had a terrific time with niece great  place especially  for children with Autism .very safe and well maintain place very clean .

The play equipment was clean and there was a nice variety of things to do. There was one person behind the registration counter and another person who worked in the play area trying to engage the kids in play. You do need to supervise your own child to make sure she/he plays safely, which all parents/guardians were doing. There were several slides and several swings, tunnels, small stationery ride on and bouncy toys, and a foam pit. There was also many things to climb onto or under. There was also a small play kitchen area. The bathroom was roomy and clean with a pull down diaper changing station. I do see that the entry way where the cubbies were is a small area but when I went there were only about 6 children (and 6 adults) so this was not an issue. I can see how it would be extremely crowded if it was at full capacity, especially since this is the area where one has to take off shoes and put them back on after the play sessions is over.  I am a pediatric Occupational Therapist and thought the environment was great and safe for kids with special needs however; when I went, there were not a lot of children and adults. At full capacity it might be challenging to children with sensory issues. I will say that I thought it was a fun experience for my grandson. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Tania Serpas ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: This is not a place for kids with special needs as advertised. It is more of a place that people take their toddlers and little kids especially during the cold months to enjoy as a playground. Some of the staff are very nice but others leave much to be desired. There was one staff member that actually singled out my child for running around with another kid and made him sit in a separate room till he cooled down. Did not bother to address the fact that there were two kids running around. My son is autistic and was hyper aware of being singled out in a room full of adults and kids. Another time this same staff member put her hands on my son to ""calm him down"" and my son slapped her hand away. She proceeded to tell me to do something about it but my response is why are you touching my son when you do not even know what his special needs are and how he will react to being personally touched. Obviously my son read right through her supposed I mean well act and did not like her at all. That was the last time I went there. I do not recommend this place to anyone who has special needs kids especially ADHD, they are not very welcoming. More concerned about the babies and toddler around than providing a space with no judgement for special needs children. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Christina Ciccione ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 11 months ago ⏎ Review: Clean, friendly staff and great space!

We were greeted by a girl who was interacting with my children & ready to play with them.  I will start by saying that the price is $24 per child, no matter how many children you have there’s no ‘sibling discount’ so if you have 5 children you’re paying $120 for an hour and a half, which seems super pricey to me since you’re limited on time & things to do. Next thing that I really want to hit on is that when I came in I had my mom & children ( we were the only ones there and it was already 10 mins after the time frame started). My grandma decided she wanted to stay outside to get some air with her medical service dog (clearly labeled, tags & a plus- hypoallergenic). After being outside for a little while she wanted to come in. My mom said to one of the girls working ‘is it okay if I let my mom in with her service dog I will tell her to stand right at the entry way with her so she could still see the kids playing. ‘ the girl paused &  then went to the back room to ask the other worker if it was okay. She came back out, didn’t say anything at all and after two minutes we asked her what the answer was. She said ‘unfortunately no she can’t come in with the dog because it’s not big enough and people might have allergies sorry’ ok, understandable if it was just a random dog that wasn’t a registered service dog. Ok, whatever so we just say ok you can’t deny her because she’s a service animal and she’s like ok I’ll go back and ask again , at that point it was just fine & my grandma went and sat in the car not causing a stink. So after about 2 minutes from here she said oh you can take the baby out of his car seat and go walk around by the kids if you want. I said oh no it’s okay he’s sleeping now they’re having so much fun together. She’s like oh okay. So then I was wondering, “am I supposed to be standing with all of my children playing with them?” She said “Yeah you’re supposed to be, but since it’s not that busy it’s okay.” I have never been to a play space where my children were the only ones there within my eyesight where I had to be up their butt watching them every move aside from the couple times I went to help them. So again, put off a little bit by basically being told I needed to play with them when the girl who let us in was playing with them at first I though that was the idea of the gym. ⏎ Overall it’s a cute idea, definitely over priced for a short time &  there are a few blurred lines as to what is supposed to go on inside the gym area ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jacquelyn Greenspan ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: The owner Rachel is absolutely obnoxious, nasty and repugnant.

Sensory beans was always a fun safe space for my autistic son, and his big sister. This happened a few months ago and I planned on never sharing because I didn’t want to ruin one’s reputation, but the same thing has happened multiple times. The owner is extremely unprofessional and rude. This is NOT the attitude for this environment, especially when dealing with our babies with sensory issues. The staff here is caring and incredible, much more professional than the manager. I have witnessed the manager talk so rudely to her employees, which breaks my heart because they’re always the ones who make my son smile.

That said, they are unreasonably stringent with the time restrictions. If you show up even a minute early, they will keep the doors locked and refuse to let you inside until it’s your appointment time. I went on a day when it was pouring outside and they had parents with infants and toddlers wait outside in the rain until it was exactly 4pm. There were no other children inside at that time so it wasn’t due to spacing or safety issues. Most indoor play spaces will let you in or allow you to wait in the waiting area if you come early. They do have a waiting area so it’s ridiculous that they won’t let you in if you’re just a few minutes early. Considering there are so many new indoor play spaces now, they should show a little kindness and courtesy towards customers if they want people to come back. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Kirsten DeDona ⏎ Rating: 4/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: Nice place but the party was really quick.

Being able to run around so free not hearing mommy or daddy or older sister or older brother saying “no!” Or “stop it!” Or “get off of that”!… Just being able to bounce around on everything  padded without resistance from anyone or anything!! he had such a great time at the party, but I decided to look into it and see how much it would cost for him to go to a session of “open mat“ to my surprise it was not expensive at all. For $17 for an hour and a half of free play, it’s actually every mother‘s best hidden secret lol it gets them super tired all that bottled up energy out… And they have so much fun here! I say that this place is actually the perfect place for ages 1 1/2 to 4 1/2-five years old… It allows them at this sensitive age to be free and explore without a mom being worried that they’re going to hurt themselves in the process. The staff is super friendly, they’re so great with the kids, even with the moms… Their mats are sprayed and Lysol’d and disinfected between every session… I highly recommend sensory beans to any mother looking to find that nice clean safe place for their child to go and enjoy yourselves… nothing is better than having a place your child always looks forward to being at and at the end of the day will help them sleep happily at night lol.

As a mother with a toddler, I chose to stand out of the way of the cubbies to feed my child a snack by the door, along with a few other moms and their kids. There was physically no room to get our things by the cubbies due to the poor design of the space, so in order to prevent our toddlers from heading back into the play area to run around and possibly prevent clean up for the next event, we chose snack time as a distraction. We were repeatedly (unkindly) asked to move and get our things, which was physically impossible due to the lack of space. ⏎  ⏎ I also witnessed the owner scolding another mother of two while she was in the cubby area in the middle of strapping her daughter into her car seat. Yes, she was taking up space, but when you don't plan your business to have ample amount of space for your guests to arrive and depart, that is your own fault. This mother was not doing anything wrong, and handled the situation with so much grace. ⏎  ⏎ For a place designed for kids with special needs, I'm shocked at the owners apparent disregard and lack of planning for something as universally challenging as transition times. I'm also surprised that this space doesn't have any areas where children can escape from the excessive stimulation. They could have used some inspiration from the sensory gyms in Roslyn Public Schools. ⏎  ⏎ I'm sad that we will no longer be attending open play sessions here, as my son really did enjoy it. The staff, aside from the owner, was always great with the children and genuinely seemed to enjoy working with the kids. Perhaps the owner should take a cue from her younger staff, who seem to understand how to interact with the public much better than she does. ⏎  ⏎ As disappointing as this experience was, I am comforted by the fact that Long Island has so many indoor play places for this age group, with more on the way. Hopefully someone reading this review will take my experience into consideration when designing their own space, and learn from Sensory Beans' mistakes. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Pablo Cerda ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: Owner is rude.

We’ve always loved coming to Sippy Cups Cafe for open play — it’s such a fun and welcoming space — but hosting a birthday party here was truly next level. 10/10 experience! Everything was absolutely perfect, from the incredibly kind and helpful staff to the out-of-this-world cupcakes they provided. I didn’t have to stress about a single thing. Danielle and her team went above and beyond to make the day special.

The café itself is on the smaller side, and it definitely gets crowded quickly, especially during peak times. ⏎  ⏎ My kids had a great time and enjoyed the different play areas, which is always the most important part. However, as a parent, I couldn’t help but notice that the space could benefit from some updates. A lot of the toys seemed worn out, and several pieces were missing. The play mats were heavily dirty and worn out, and the floors didn’t appear to be cleaned very well, which was a bit concerning. ⏎  ⏎ With a little bit of TLC—like deeper cleaning, some fresh equipment, and regular maintenance—this place could be truly great. The potential is definitely there, and again, my children did enjoy themselves. I just hope the owners consider making a few improvements to enhance the experience for both kids and parents. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Daniel London ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a month ago ⏎ Review: They do such an amazing job!

We had to change a 4th birthday party planned for my backyard with about 40 people last minute due to weather (48hrs!). I called Sippy Cups and they didn’t just “make it work” they went above and beyond! Danielle is super easy to work, and very generous when it came to a few little extra coffees and stuff for the parents and using her decorations.  And her team was amazing with the kids - all of which had a blast. Every parent there left saying they want their kids next party there and all the adults had a lovely time bc the kids were contained and entertained so we could actually talk!  All around it was a hit and I highly recommend!! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Christopher Wall ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: N/A ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Rebecca Martinez ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: I'd bring my twins here every day if I could.

We’ve gone to almost every event they have hosted. We go to the Open Play which the kids love and so do I, because on occasion I’ll bring work to get done. The kids stay entertained the entire time we are there! We’ve had a birthday party there, which was hands down incredible. We’ve done the Kids Night Out events, we love that we can trust the staff and our kids feel safe.

I feel so comfortable letting my niece and nephew play here. Kids are able to express themselves and make friends, while they also get to play on different structures and equipment. Also, the facility is SUPER clean for being a children’s playground, the staff even goes around every so often (I’d say every 10 minutes) to wipe all toys and play structures down after children play with them. The bathrooms have CLEAN changing tables, and the snack area has complimentary tea and coffee! Love it!! ⏎ Did I mention the staff is very attentive and helpful? They will assure everyone is safe. ⏎ They have a few different play structures with different surprises inside each one, kitchen, dinos, trains, and more. There is even air hockey, building blocks, and crafts for the older kiddos to do if they tag along. I just can’t wait to watch Imaginarium grow and see what other cool stuff they have to offer in the future.

It smells like feet as soon as you walk in. The toys are filthy and if you look around it seems nothing has been cleaned in years. I have been to this facility many times and never have seen any of the staff cleaning. The next time I go I will gladly take pictures to provide proof. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Cassondra West ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: We love Imaginarium for many reasons, the first being the space is big enough for kids to run around and make friends, but not too large where I feel the need to know exactly where they are at all times while playing. I'm able to relax because I know they are playing in a safe place. It's not filled with loud bounce houses and music like a couple of the other indoor playgrounds we have visited within the state. They do sometimes have music playing, but families don't have to shout over it to be heard. ⏎  ⏎ The staff are friendly folk, it's affordable, you can bring food in and sit in the seating area (sans peanut products), its not overstimulating, and it's just a gem of a place to have local to us in SOMD. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Angie Ponce de Leon ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: a year ago ⏎ Review: I took my 20 month old daughter to Imaginarium today, and I was really disappointed. First, it was FILTHY. The toys were NOT clean at all, the wall decor and houses were covered in thick dust like they hadn't been cleaned since they opened, the equipment was covered in months worth of dirty handprints. At one point, my daughter was playing in the blue foam blocks and picked up a huge ball of hair. Disgusting. I get that children aren't always the cleanest little people, but for that reason they should have a daily cleaning crew. Clearly they do NOT. Secondly,  the rules state socks must be worn... but kids were barefoot. I get it's summer but kids are climbing all over the place... where sweaty feet are. Finally, there needs to be an age/height limit. There were huge kids like 6-7 yos running around, rough-housing, putting the littles at risk of getting run over and hurt. I thought this place was exclusively for younger children ( < 5) but I guess not. I really wanted to like this place because it has great potential.  It is a great idea and has a lil lounge and store... but I cannot get fast how gross it was. I should have taken more pictures but I was too busy making sure my daughter wouldn't get run over by the big kids. :/ Sadly, I won't be taking my kiddo back. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Susan Dambrosio ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: Thank you so much for your 5 star review! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Mariah Riedell ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 2 years ago ⏎ Review: Great little indoor play place.

Throughout our time here, I have leaned on this place to help my kiddo grow in a safe and imaginative environment and I have never been disappointed. The play structures are incredibly intricate and promote imagination that I know many kids are losing sight off with the new age of electronics. I love the staff here. They are sincerely caring, helpful, and attentive. There is not much for kids to do in this area and this place has been an addition that enhances the community tremendously. The prices are also phenomenal. While the cost of everything is on the rise, the pricing here has been consistent without sacrificing value.

The set up inside is a lot of fun. There’s plenty of space for kids to run around but fun points of interest for them to explore also. The owner is very passionate and personable and will go above and beyond to ensure everyone has a good time. There are frequently age appropriate events and the staff very deliberately cultivates each one to ensure the highest quality possible. A must-go location if you are in southern Maryland and have kids. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Carson Caperones ⏎ Rating: 1/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: It was alright ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Cindy Perrell ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: The kids had a great time!

This is just what good ole' Southern Maryland needed. Their facility is so clean and all of their employees, including the owner, are so nice and caring. My son always looks forward to their regular open play as well as their various special events and parent's night out. If you haven't checked this amazing place out - you need to now!! Also a great place to have your child's birthday party; my son really enjoyed his last year. Thank you Imaginarium for bringing this much needed service to SOMD! :) ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Brandy Kennedy ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: What a great place for your child to run around for an hour or two. It is inside and exceptionally large. My little one ran around and was never bored here. The price was great as well. They even had music playing in the back for the kids. Highly recommend here to have your little ones run around safely for a few hours. This beats being outside in the heat and humidity. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Nick & Tatiana Sweetman ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: Thank you for your review! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Ariana C ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: My 3 year old LOVES this place. The workers are super attentive and friendly. They have awesome events for kids. ⏎ We come at least twice a month. Even during the pandemic, once they opened back up, we continued to come. ⏎ They were constantly cleaning the play areas and toys and I remember they had breaks between open play to sanitize everything. ⏎ Glad this place is here. Not much to do around here for kids indoors so this is amazing. I think pricing is fair in my opinion. Worth the 3 hours of open play! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Laura Kelley ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: We loved everything about Imaginarium! The space is huge and clean, the play structures were so much fun for my daughters, and my husband and I had plenty of places to sit where we could keep an eye on them and enjoy a cup of coffee from their cafe area. Both my 2 and 7 year olds really enjoyed themselves. I only wished we lived close by to attend some of their amazing programs and play regularly! Highly recommend! ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Patricia Conley ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 3 years ago ⏎ Review: Great place for kids.  Attended a birthday party there.

For little little kids, highchairs, and a little place for them to play.

The entire process of scheduling, planning and getting there was so easy! You owe it to yourself to bring your littles to this wonderful place. So much space inside, such fun things to do and it was so clean! The staff was so friendly, professional and helpful! This place felt “safe” and that is a huge deal, especially in this day and age. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Sara Seifert ⏎ Rating: 3/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: I really wanted to love this place, but it was underwhelming. IMO the price is a little too steep for what you get. ⏎  ⏎ The play structures are super cool. I loved the art section and the reading nook, but there’s so much unrealized potential. ⏎  ⏎ There are little toys scattered throughout like legos, train sets, magna tiles, and play food, but it’s such a mess. We couldn’t play with some of them because they were missing pieces, or didn’t seem to actually go together. I get it, tons of kids come every day, but there are so many organizational options that could be used to actually encourage play and imagination, like the name says. ⏎  ⏎ The art section was super cute, but again, underwhelming. The only things available were construction paper, a few random crayons and colored pencils, dried out markers with mixed tops, scissors, and chalk. There are so many ways to make this more exciting and organized. Especially since we paid to play here. ⏎  ⏎ The reading nook is a great concept, but it’s right next to the giant castle/ship structure, so it doesn’t really lend itself to reading. There was a cool, giant bear, but that got put away because someone used it as a landing pad for the slide. The books seemed pretty random and old. Everything in this place could be so much more! ⏎  ⏎ I was also disappointed in kid behavior. I know there’s not much employees may be able to do, but it’s dangerous. Kids throwing things and roughhousing on top of two-story structures shouldn’t be acceptable when people are paying money to play here. ⏎  ⏎ In all honesty, I feel like I just took my kids to an indoor playground and paid $22 for it. I don’t think it’s worth it. It could be in the future, but it’s not right now. ⏎  ⏎ ----------------------- ⏎  ⏎ Reviewer: Jen Barbour ⏎ Rating: 5/5 ⏎ Time: 4 years ago ⏎ Review: Imaginarium is amazing!

I have taken our 3 year old twins twice now and it's really great on days when it's raining or too cold to play outside! It's very unique and I absolutely recommend! Staff were friendly and helpful both times we've gone, and i also noticed staff does go around and disinfect through out the play sessions. There's always been lots of other children when we've gone and there's lots of interaction which is great social skills for kids! We will definitely go back!
