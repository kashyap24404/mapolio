They make you buy their socks the first time even if you have socks with grip… second is the cleanliness and the types of toys.  Dust and dirt everywhere.   Clearly a lack of cleaning overall.  Plastics pieces and foam were everywhere (choking hazard). Vacuuming and moping/spraying needs to happen everyday, everywhere.  The young teenage employees should be walking around and wiping stuff down not just sitting on their phones. Some of toys are dangerous for small children especially in the “doctors” area.  Flimsy plastic that could break and or too small for choking.  And yes, every kid puts stuff in their mouth even when you say no.  The desk in the “grocery store” is dangerous for fingers and sharp corners.\nLastly, it’s absolutely freezing.

His favorite the ball sucker wall thing was his ultimate favorite. There were alot of signs that stuff was broken or not allowed to use. Average play places charge for the same cost with socks. I just found the membership outrageous. There are other places that have 10 passes for less than $100. They wanted almost $400 a month or almost $700 a year. You would have to make sure to attend every day to get your money's worth. The kids birthday party area is not ideal. It is very small. Would just recommend to come once in a while.

No place to sit or stand. Most adults stayed outside. The establishment  would not let us use the bathroom unless you pay $2.50 for the socks to walk to the back Where the bathrooms were.   We had greatgrand parents in ther 80s who could not put the socks on so had to walk to the coffee shop. A father had his young daughter come to him who needed the bathroom but he was told he couldn't go back without purchasing the socks. You can't supervise you children unless you  purchase the socks.  I myself purchased the socks and was with the kids.  I multiple times witnessed the counter girl going to the back and snapping at the children for only one on the trampoline at a time, but you had to go across the trampoline to get to the foam pit. There is a big cone by the merry-go-round (Which never stops) with a hollow center that when the child goes head first into is totally unable to get out of and is now stuck in on there head. Had it been a smaller child they would have gone straight down on their head.  The toys in the clinic were brocken so when the kids put the audoscope to there face they could get cut.

I had to call to get an explanation and was essentially accused of gaming their system to get more kids in for free (again - due to how THEIR system recognized/discounted memberships). In another instance, we brought pizza to celebrate a birthday (not a party, just family) and were told that we could only have food if we had a party room.  Which they wouldn't allow us to reserve.

Is my favorite place to go in the winter time!

When you walk through the first set of doors you cannot advance further. Would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time online. Because trying to buy them on arrival is super frustrating. You are stuck between the two doors that are still the entryway, and so you have to stand there and order tickets while your kids are waiting to get in and other people are trying to get in past you. I tried 2 different cards online and it didn't work (which my cards worked fine before and after this place and have plenty of money)  So my friend had to use hers, and it worked. I look at my account and they charge my account four times and then charged it an additional four times for a dollar fee. It charged me four times and we never got any code.So my cards were working, but the website was weird. Then I see there's multiple refunds on my account while we are there. Then I all of a sudden, get 2 emails with codes 30 minutes later. What's someone else's name on it? Which doesn't make sense since I used my phone?So how was there someone else's name on my code. I went to run outside to grab a water and had my daughter stand by the door to let me back in. Since I didn't have the code and it was on my friend's phone. However, they have it so that you cannot open the door from the inside, no handles, which is a safety hazzard. And my daughter couldn't open the door to let me back in. My daughter had to run through and find my friend to give me the code. My friend even walked over to open the door but they have no handles on the inside to open the door for me. So I had to wait for her to find the code on her phone again for me to enter it. What she had to hold up to the glass so I could see to enter the code to enter in again even though we were already inside and had already paid. It doesn't appear that there's any staff there at all to help you. Kind of makes me worry that there's nobody there if there were problems. To add to that, I would say, the price is pretty high for what's there. The pictures online look much cooler than the place actually is and the pictures online are kind of deceiving. The cost to get in there is the same cost as urban air and urban area is much better quality. I would say the place is just okay, but honestly I think the admission should be about anywhere from $5 to $8. They have some cool features, but it really is just an indoor play set. I have been to other indoor playgrounds that charge a lot less. The signs everywhere are a little intense. At one point another boy hurt my daughter and her finger looked broken, I don't think it is but very swollen but there are no staff to ensure safety and that kids are not being too aggressive. Just so many odd signs, one of them being that it's a crime to enter without paying, which duh...  you should pay. But then even more signs in the two year old area that if you are able to read the sign that you're too old to be in this area. Which also a duh. But if there were some staff there to ensure rules were being followed, there wouldn't need to be so many signs. I don't know. Just overall, experience wasn't very good especially  trying to get in and the handle less door was not the greatest, priced too high, buying tickets in-between the outside doors with the cold was a little ridiculous. I don't normally leave reviews, but wanted to leave this because if I would have seen a review like this.I probably would have tried to go somewhere else.\n\nTo also add i tried calling my friend's phone and she didn't see my call and may daughter almost couldn't hear me through the glass door so I can to shout for her to hear me. If my daughter hadn't not been by the door and my friend never saw her phone I would have been locked outside for a long time. Which is also worrisome.\n\nMy 7YO and 6YO were bored in the first few minutes of being here i had to convince them to stay and try and make friends since we spent so much money to get in.""},{""reviewer"":""Kathy Stroth"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""Kathy, thank you so much for the five star review!""},{""reviewer"":""Amy Rogers"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""Super way to let kids go crazy!""},{""reviewer"":""Kevin Dahm"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""Pretty cool.

We usually just go to Rebe’s Play Cafe in St Paul and sometimes the MiniSota Play Cafe in Maple Grove, but we wanted to check out a different place for once.\n\nThe drive wasn’t too bad, about a half hour for us. My husband and I took our 16 month old daughter and she had a BLAST!!!\n\nAt first glance, I wasn’t too sure if she would like it. Compared to the other play cafe’s it’s a lot smaller. When you walk in the door, everything is pretty much right in front of you. It can look a little overwhelming at first, but Kirsten has done a wonderful job organizing the place. They have all sorts of great toys and obstacles for kids. Everything from slides, ball pits, sensory room, play pretend little towns, play kitchen, little vehicles for kids to ride in, and arts and crafts areas.\n\nThe owner was very kind and welcoming to us. Check in didn’t take very long, even when we came on their busiest day, President’s Day.\n\nRight inside the door is their lobby, which there can be traffic for those coming and going. They have slides for smaller ones and bigger kids. I appreciated the smaller and bigger ball pits with the soft play foam perimeters. Our little one kept bouncing back and forth between them.\n\nTheir cafe area is smaller compared to the other play cafe’s. I would have you and your fam eat before you come. This is mostly a place to bring your kiddos for them to play. I came the day there was no more water bottles. You pay for a cup of hot chocolate or coffee that you make in those fancy instant packets. But it doesn’t fill the whole entire cup. They have a fridge filled with juices and sparkling waters and other drinks, you can purchase.\n\nThere is a small seating area just to the left of the lobby and ahead of that, the kitchen, where there is a table where kids can draw and color. The bathrooms are tucked away to the left of their kitchen area. I liked two stalls, one with a changing table and one without. We ended up using the one without otherwise we would have waited over ten minutes for the changing table.\n\nTheis place kept our baby girl so busy for a few hours. We stayed all the way till closing at 1pm. It was a great experience and tuckered her out right before her 2pm nap time.\n\nMy husband likes that it is smaller than other play cafe’s because it doesn’t seem like we’re drowning with toys and obstacles. I didn’t mind the smaller size as well. It was easier to keep an eye on our girl who zips around really quickly.\n\nOverall a cute little play area.

I noticed that some children were playing unsupervised, creating unsafe situations. For example, I witnessed a six-month-old child almost getting hurt in the designated baby area due to older children using equipment incorrectly and without appropriate supervision.\n\nI appreciate your previous response to my concerns, but it seems that the essential rules aimed at ensuring the safety of all children are not being adequately enforced. It is particularly troubling that enforcement appears to focus primarily on monetary transactions rather than the essential safety regulations that protect our kids.\n\nAs a concerned patron, I urge you to take immediate action to address these issues. If these safety concerns are not addressed properly, I feel compelled to share my experiences on social media and spread the word about the lack of safety at Good Times Park.\n\nMaintaining a safe environment for children should be the highest priority, and I sincerely hope to see improvements that would encourage me to return as a customer in the future.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

It is a place full of colorful swings, slides, and the occasional sound of music playing from a distant vendor’s cart. For most, it is a space of happiness. However, for me, my experience with the Good Times Park has been different. It is a place where I often feel alone, reminded of the harsh realities of my life as an orphan, and of the mean lady who often makes my visits there even more difficult.\n\nBeing an orphan is not something I ever imagined would define my life. I lost my parents when I was very young, and since then, I have been in and out of foster homes. I never really had a place to call my own. The Good Times Park, with its bright colors and cheerful faces, was one of the few places I hoped to find a sense of belonging. I would often walk through the park, watching the other children with their parents, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of longing deep inside. I wondered what it would be like to have a family that would take me to the park, to share a moment of joy with me.\n\nYet, there is one person who has made it difficult for me to enjoy the park: the lady who is often there. She is an older woman, and her presence seems to cast a shadow over the park’s otherwise sunny atmosphere. She is the park’s caretaker, or at least, that’s what I have gathered. Every time I visit, she seems to be watching me with disdain. She never smiles or greets me like she does with the other children. If I get too close to the swings or the slides, she often scolds me, telling me that I shouldn’t be playing because I don’t belong there. Her words sting, and it is as if the park, a place that should be filled with joy, becomes a reminder of my loneliness.\n\nThe harshness of her attitude is even more difficult to bear because of the absence of my own family. When I see children laughing and playing with their parents, it reminds me of what I don’t have. I can feel the emptiness, and the lady’s unkindness only deepens that feeling. Her presence feels like an additional weight on my shoulders, as though I am being constantly reminded of my lack of a family and the cruelty that exists in the world.\n\nI sometimes wonder why she acts this way toward me. Perhaps it is because I am an orphan, a child without a place to call home, and she sees me as different. But the truth is, her behavior only adds to my sense of isolation. I wish that people like her would understand the pain of being without a family and the importance of kindness. The Good Times Park, which should be a place of joy and healing, often feels like an unwelcoming reminder of my struggles.\n\nDespite her mean demeanor, I try to find moments of peace in the park. I sit on the benches, watching the other children play. I try to lose myself in their laughter and the sense of normalcy that surrounds them, but it is never quite the same. My heart aches as I realize that my life will never be like theirs. I have no one to share these moments with, and the cruel lady’s behavior only reinforces that loneliness.\n\nHowever, I still hold on to the hope that someday things will change. Maybe the lady will be kinder, maybe I will find a family, or maybe I will learn to see the park differently. For now, I continue to visit the Good Times Park, though the experiences are bittersweet. The pain of being an orphan and the meanness of the lady linger in my heart, but I still try to find a glimmer of hope and joy in the moments when I can.\n\nIn conclusion, the Good Times Park is a place filled with contrasts for me. It is a space that should represent happiness and connection, but for me, it often feels like a symbol of my loneliness and pain. The lady, whose coldness hurts more than I can explain, is just one part of the challenge. As an orphan, I long for the simple pleasures that others seem to take for granted.

There are never field trips on Mondays and that’s great! They are constantly making improvements, most recently: new flooring in areas, more things in the baby area, and a ninja obstacle course. There is also a large eating area with high chairs which is great!\n\nI would love to see a baby/toddler wall seat installed in one of the restroom stalls because it’s hard to use the restroom when you are alone with a crawling baby.

Everything is roped/gated off to try to prevent any leaving, but the desk where you check in was not paying attention to much more than their phone.\nThe issues I had: parents were NOT watching their children and no one was enforcing the rules (no running, screaming, rough housing). Many times older kids would come chasing each other, literally screaming, and it scared some of the younger children and made it hard to enjoy. Most parents were sitting to the side on their phone or computer. I wish there was more enforcement and accountability on staff and parents end of things to make the park enjoyable for all visiting.

The price is for all day and you can come and go as you please for that one admission fee. There are a few arcade machines and fun ride ons available for credits called “flames”. We bought 50 flames for $10, which my kids mostly used for the ride ons. It’s only 5 flames per ride.

The birthday party meal package that we went with included pizza, cake, beverages, decorations, credits for games/rides, and goody bags. You're able to bring in outside food with the party so we brought a few snacks and sparkling waters for the adults. We (and our guests) were so impressed with the cleanliness and quality of the facility. The play structure is completely enclosed (so no intrepid explorers can make their way out of the play area) and can fully accommodate adults so the parents can get in to help kids when needed (or just to join in the fun). There is another play structure for smaller kids (toddlers in diapers and under) so there was something fun for all ages.\n\nWe chose a 10:30am slot on a Saturday and it was great for our ages 2-5. It wasn't too busy (started getting pretty packed by the time we left at 2:30pm) and the majority of kids in the structure were around that age. I felt safe letting my 3 and 5 year olds run free with less supervision.\n\nThe thing that really stood out was the professionalism and attention to detail of the events team that handled our party! They took care of everything and made sure we were having a great time. I highly recommend this place for birthday parties and we'll definitely be back on another day just to have hours of fun climbing, running, and playing in this awesome place!""},{""reviewer"":""Nat"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""3 months ago"",""content"":""Staff is lovely!

It was the first day of Spring Break and EID. Management needs to plan better staffing-wise around school breaks and holidays.\n\nA little while into our visit, the male staff found two young kids but could not find their adult. He carried them both around, trying to find their adult. There has to be a better way for staff to locate parents than this. With how chaotic it was, he could have easily tripped while carrying both of these kids and they all would have gotten hurt. Mom was eventually found, and all seemed well.\n\nA little boy hurt himself pretty badly (gash on his head, absolutely needed stitches). Thankfully, I had napkins at my table and was able to apply pressure while my husband told the staff to get the first aid kit, and the child's parents were found. About 30 minutes after the family had left, there was still blood on the floor next to my table. I walked to the counter (noticed a bloody gauze pad on the floor on the way) to let the female employee know about the blood on the floor and the gauze pad, and her response was less than desired. She cut me off before I could even tell her where the blood was by saying 'We are working on it.\"" I tried to tell her that I understood they were working on it but I wanted to let her know the location, and she cut me off AGAIN with, 'We know, we are working on it.' (I never was able to tell her about the bloody gauze pad or the location of blood by my table)\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, the male staff member was walking around the sitting area with paper towels and a bottle of cleaner, not wearing gloves. I am not sure if he was looking for blood spots or was just doing some regular cleaning.\n\nWe left at 7:30, and the blood was still on the floor near my table.\n\nWe have been to this location before and had a great time. It was clean and the staff were friendly.

I was changing diapers and getting my son ready to go to the emergency room. Without asking us, she called an ambulance, we wanted to buy socks because my son soiled his with vomit, the socks they sell are not safe and have no grip, how is that possible in a place that specializes in children?

The management of the people at the park is non-existent. Multiple times that we have been to this park, the equipment has been taken over by people looking 18+ years old. The equipment is designed for younger kids up to middle school, so people adult‐size make the park cramped and unsafe for children to play. The employees ignore any of this going on and let everything be free roam. Our younger child was almost crushed under a 6'2 probably 200+ pound person that jumped down the strap climbing area without looking at the 4-6 year olds climbing from the bottom. The soccer area which is about 20 feet by 30 feet in size was taken over by about 15+ of these adults that were wrestling and pushing each other and small children out of the way. There should be restrictions enforced for safety in a play area of this size, but there aren't any. This crowd shows up regularly as well as they have been there almost every time I've visited.

And the guilt associated when you are finding this out when you are standing there with your child or your grandchildren and you have to tell them because of how incredibly expensive it is that you will not be able to play there is incredible! - it almost seems like that guilt is counted on as it is really tough to tell your kids or grandkids that we have to go because you did not budget for the (shocking) amount  of money it costs to play there. That said,  if cost is not an issue for you, it looks like the place can be fun for the kids or Grandkids. **NOTE** We did not play there because of the high cost of admission - we found that Chutes and Ladders - also in Bloomington - is free and although it is outdoors, the Grandkidos had a terrific time and is one of their favorite places to play.

Hope to see you again soon! …""},{""reviewer"":""Ashley Jensen"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""I have three critiques and LOTS OF GOOD THINGS about our experience, I'm going to drop the critiques first because lets be honest, that's why most of us read reviews.\n\n1. I really wish there was a large digital clock on the wall so I didn't have to keep pulling out my phone to see the time.\n\n2. The price - we gotta talk about the price since it is probably most people's hesitation to visiting. For the size of the gym and what they offer, the price is STEEP. Especially with all of the other indoor play areas in the metro area. A price like $18.99 per child, siblings discounted to $16.99 should 1000000% include same day re-entry. I feel like this is a total oversight and missed opportunity to gain a solid customer base in the area. **Worth mentioning that on Facebook, the pricing says it has changed to $15.99/child and $13.99/sibling, but the WRTS website still lists $18.99/$16.99. With tax, it was $17.33 for my son to play on 6/3/2025**\n\nNot to mention, the Monthly Memberships : 1 child for $250; 2 children for $300; 3 children for $380; 4 children for $450 is wild. You would have to go 14 times to even pay for the membership cost. This is another financial aspect that doesn't feel appropriate for the location based on what's also available for options nearby.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the Minnesota Children's Museum has daily entry of $16-19 and a YEARLY membership of $160-260. This includes three entire floors of play areas and experiences.\n\nI know that WRTS is new to the area and obviously wants to stick around for a long time, but having more accessible pricing would definitely make more families visit. The Little Village in CG has figured out the pricing of memberships perfectly for the area, IMO.\n\n3. Although having a mini store of things to buy is cool, it's like walking my ND kid into a gift shop and I was not expecting to navigate that upon entry.\n\nNOW ON TO THE GOOD THINGS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY!!! When asked how many stars my son would rate WRTS, he said \""infinite because this is the best place I have ever been to\"".\n\n1. There was no unnecessary music playing! YAY!!! We were prepared with our noise canceling headphones, but it was such a relief that there was no music playing.\n\n2. The area had a vast array of swings, pretend play toys, a trampoline, a climbing dome, life sized building blocks, a massive Tetris and connect four and so many books.\n\n3. There are some tables in the entry area where you can sit and eat a snack or lunch if you packed them. They also have a vending machine with some items in it (my son is GF and I think there were only two GF items but that's better than none). We will definitely plan to pack a snack for next time.\n\n4. Accommodations in the bathroom for littles. A simple step stool and potty seat goes such a long way.\n\n5. A changing room for any size child.\n\n6. I know WRTS can't control their customer base, but every parent I spoke to while we were there was so kind and it felt good to be in a play area where other parents \""just get it\"". It builds a kind of community that we all desperately need.\n\n7. I appreciate the fact that there were so many small pieced toys to play with (magnets, puzzles, etc), even though those would be a nightmare to pick up at the end of the day, its such a fun thing for the kids to play with while they visit.\n\n8. We have been considering a sensory swing for my son's room for a while now but we haven't been able to determine which one he wanted. After our visit, and his ability to test out all the swings there, we know which one he wants! It was an unintentional sensory swing testing area, hahaha.\n\n9. We were able to find toys that we loved that we never would have thought to try or buy before.\n\n10. There is counter seating at the half wall so parents could sit and watch their kids if they wanted. I didn't look to see if there were plug-ins at the wall to charge electronics, but that would be cool if there was. But also nbd if there isn't.\n\nOverall, my son can't wait to go back and we will return!

We left that facility with a very positive view of the company and were looking forward to taking him again.\n\nWe were only the second family to arrive early on a Thursday morning, and it was clear that the facility had not been cleaned the night before. The seating area was still full of crumbs. There were small toys scattered all over the gym as well, demonstrating that the floor couldn't possibly have been cleaned and definitely nothing had been sanitized. Also, no soap dispensers in the women's bathroom were functional.\n\nWe were most looking forward to the zipline, which my son got to try in Nashville and loved. However, I don't think the zipline setup at this location is safe. The lane of padding was too narrow and metal supports in the middle (where a child is most likely to fall off) had no padding at all. My son did fall off, bounce off the padding and onto the floor, and didn't want anything to do with the zipline after that.\n\nAlso, I realize that a fire exit is necessary and required by law, but the one here is very much accessible to any ambulatory child. Many autistic children, mine included, are practiced and efficient elopers. My son tried to make a quick exit outside with effectively no barrier to stop him.\n\nHonestly, the pricing at this place is also completely bananas. Good Times is $24 a month, Inneractive is $36 a month, and Eagle's Nest is $9 a day. Unless there is something specific at We Rock the Spectrum that your child really enjoys, you're much better off at one of their local competitors if you're just looking to burn some energy during a rainy day.""},{""reviewer"":""Emily Nielsen"",""rating"":""2/5"",""date"":""3 months ago"",""content"":""I personally think the Spectrum should be open to everyone even when there is a birthday event and only just reserve the private room for birthday and unique events.

He  kept on saying he wants to go swinging, it crushed my heart to see him smiling and so excited when we arrived at We Rock Spectrum. The owner gave me a free pass to go for the next time we return.

I'm glad that you can go in/out with your code and there's a pretty large area to sit and eat. I was able to take my younger child to Culver's while the older one stayed with a grandparent and we ate our food and then played for more time.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that there are no staff there. When we were there today there was a kid who pretty clearly was just dropped off. He couldn't have been more than 6. He was an absolute menace. He was pushing kids and throwing their foam blocks and yelling at kids and adults alike. I encountered this kid in several different areas and he never had anyone with him. I just wish there was even one person on site to report these kinds of things to.

While there were several engaging features, I noticed some areas that could benefit from improvements to ensure a safer and more enriching visit for everyone.\n\nOne of my main concerns was the bouncy pad. It appears that if children cannot easily reach the higher, air-filled section, the pad becomes flat and potentially dangerous. Unfortunately, my daughter slipped there, resulting in a minor injury to her head and nose. This design might need reevaluation to ensure that all children, regardless of their ability to reach the top, remain safe.\n\nAdditionally, the selection of building blocks was somewhat limited. For children who enjoy creative play, having a wider variety of building materials could greatly enhance their experience. It also seemed that sharing was not as encouraged as it could be, which sometimes hindered cooperative play among the kids and parents present.\n\nThe baby area was modest and felt a bit underwhelming compared to the other zones. Enhancing this area with more engaging, age-appropriate activities might make it a more attractive option for families with younger children.\n\nThe ninja area had potential, but I observed several instances of unsupervised children lingering after falls, even though the rules clearly specify that parental supervision is required. Strengthening the oversight in this area could help maintain both safety and the intended flow of activities.\n\nGiven the price of $12 per child, I felt that the overall experience did not quite match the cost.

Although there are signs with rules everywhere we saw too many people not following them. It made us feel uncomfortable. There were two bigger boys (unsupervised) tossing a football on the bounce pad with lots of little toddlers around. My son is 1 and so I had to take him away in case he got hit by the ball. Every single time my son wanted to play with the blocks in the blocks area there would be 1 or 2 kids playing with ALL of the blocks. The second time we tried playing a grandmother told me her grandson was playing with all of them (there has to be at least 50 blocks there). I had to tell my disappointed 1 year old that he couldn't play because the kid wouldn't share. The dining area had food crumbs on the tables and floor. This is disappointing because cleaning supplies are provided and people still don't clean up after themselves.

You can see an inch of dust under the equipment (especially under the slides on the right side), and the dust bunnies are floating around the room. I felt like my eyes were itchy and we didn't stay long because of it.\n\nAs others pointed out in their reviews, this place STINKS and they need to figure out why. Deep clean the equipment regularly, and repair the rips in the vinyl mats. Also - the games on the low walls for the littlest kids to play with  in the toddler area no longer have graphics, they've all rubbed off, and the games with mechanisms that you move around in them are broken off and they need to be replaced. These games are pretty important for toddlers and pre-walkers, as there's not a ton for them to do at this playground aside from that toddler zone.\n\nMore ventilation in the room is needed to keep germs at bay and to cool the space. With all glass around the space and a lot of bodies packed in there, it gets hot quickly.\n\nI'd also recommend gating off the toddler zone. Both times we've been there, parents are on their phones and letting their kids run wild. Older kids take over the toddler area and it is intimidating for the toddlers and keeps them from being able to play freely without getting run over. Other indoor playgrounds we've visited have the toddler area gated off, with clear signage that it is only for kids 0-3, or with a height maximum.""},{""reviewer"":""Ashlei Kraemer"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""Not enough seating but kids of all ages loved it!!""},{""reviewer"":""Jake Kvanbeck"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Jamall Dyar"",""rating"":""4/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""My kids love this indoor playground as it definitely provides hours of fun.

The vibe is kind of like nobody really cares about this place, they just care about making money with minimal effort.\n\nMy suggestion would be to limit the number of families who can be in the space at one time, and have families sign up for a 2 hour slot with breaks in between for cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing.

The place was unorganized which is fine but there is no one to reset, there was definitely a high number of people inside the building and only ONE employee which is crazy to me. The ratio to employee is extremely concerning and I felt bad for the solo employee trying to handle things on their own. There had to be more than 50 people inside that building with only ONE employee. The restrooms were dirty and since they have a no shoe policy I had to enter the restroom in my socks and the floor was wet perhaps urine or who knows. That was a bit disgusting to me. It's a pretty location but it needs some serious better managing and also not to take advantage of their employees. They need to look up school days and book more employees when kids or off for a holiday because this was too crazy for me. Don't think I would come back.""},{""reviewer"":""Katri Williams"",""rating"":""2/5"",""date"":""4 months ago"",""content"":""Seems like a good idea but poorly executed and we will NOT be returning.\n\nThe website boasts of cleanliness but unless you are the first person in there - no cleaning is happening. Everything is parent policed so every time a baby put a toy in their mouth - nothing happened. There is only one employee who had to man the desk the whole time. There was no one around to reset the toys to their right spot. There was no one to make sure shoes were off and toys were not germy. No one to keep food in the party room.\nIt was a school holiday which means more kids, but they need more employees and a set limit of kids. Based on the overflowing shoe space, they clearly do not want as many kids as they had today. They need to set smaller limits and put breaks in the day to clean the area. I walked away disgusted and not wanting to come back despite the kids having a fun time and liking the toys.\nI would say Play Street Museum is their most direct competitor and I will go there every time. They are the same price but include a snack. There are add on fun activities. They also have limited play time so you know things are getting reset. And they cap the number of kids. Overall - good idea but needs much better execution.\nOh I forgot! They also suck at admin. I registered the kids the day before and they couldn’t find them in the system. Same with the waiver. If I do things online to avoid the craziness with my kids there - let it work!!

I do think the cost for one day is a bit on the higher side when compared to other comparable play places in the Twin Cities; however, The admission ticket gets you all day, which is a big difference from most places that limit your admission to two hours. When looking at the pricing online, it would seem that the monthly membership is well worth the cost. There is also no admission fee for the adults, which is quite nice in comparison to some of the other places!\n\nThe play structures are very clean and well maintained. I loved how much seating there was for the adults. You could tell that a lot of thought was put into this place to provide comfort and convenience in all aspects. I really liked that compared to other play places there were less small toys. I find in some of the other places, the small toys create a huge tripping mass very quickly. I thought the emphasis on play structures was super nice, it almost seemed like an OT built the place. My kids had a wonderful time and have been asking daily to go back!

The owner Heather is shockingly unprofessional and clearly doesn’t understand how to run a business. After I professionally requested a refund (for a 2nd time) instead of a credit via email after a misunderstanding she said I was rude and ‘never allowed back’? It was so strange. Not like I wanted to go back anyway after the struggle it was to be refunded, but it’s clear they care more about taking people’s money than providing a quality experience and doing the right thing without getting defensive.\nThere are far better places that actually value their customers.

It's kind of like a bunch of garage sale items that should've been thrown away instead of sold, all compiled together. Most material is so warn down you can see the insides. The germs and junk from the wear and tear has to be just caked into every crevice there. Honestly the whole thing needs to be completed gutted and redone. There is a strong chemical smell upon entering - like a bad cleaning agent - almost like kitty litter chemicals. The chairs available for parents to sit are so sunken and low and hard and you can't see your kids from the sitting area. There are so many enclosed places for kids to hide that it's a recipe for disaster as far as keeping your kids safe. We immediately washed all of our clothes upon returning home and felt like we even needed showers.

And finally my biggest concern is that there is NO outside food/snacks are allowed but yet, they only sell junk food. I understand this is a small business and they want us to support them by buying their snacks. However; We are strictly don’t do chips or junk food for our kids. Only fruits, vegetables & water is our usual snacks. Therefore, we have to leave after an hours & half. Try eating in the car but it’s uncomfortable. Finding a place is a bit challenging for us due to our diet & lot of fast food around here. We ended up just going to a friend house and ended up not returning.

With a mission that boldly declares, \""Finally a place where you never have to say I'm sorry,\"" this gym is truly a haven for children of all abilities.\n\nMy eleven-year-old son and I spent a weekend exploring the sensory-friendly activities offered at We Rock the Spectrum, and it was an experience that left us in awe. The gym boasts an extensive range of equipment, each thoughtfully designed to cater to various sensory needs. From suspended swings for balance and vestibular treatment to crash mats and pillows for fun, motor planning, and strength, the gym has it all.\n\nOne standout feature is the zip slider, providing stress release and promoting joint and body relaxation. The trampoline offers a fantastic opportunity for building leg and core strength, while the indoor play structure enhances climbing skills and playground expertise. The inclusion of sensory-based toys and equipment is a testament to the gym's commitment to improving auditory processing and fine motor skills.\n\nWe Rock the Spectrum goes beyond physical activities, offering a fine motor and arts and crafts area that aids in improving hand-eye coordination. The calming room, designed for regulating emotions and reducing negative sensory input, is a thoughtful touch, providing a quiet space for children to find balance.\n\nDuring our visit, my son, although initially overwhelmed by the new environment, showed genuine interest and enthusiasm. Despite not lasting long during our first visit, he expressed a desire to return—a testament to the gym's engaging and accommodating atmosphere.\n\nNot only did our time at We Rock the Spectrum provide a fun and inclusive experience, but it also offered valuable insights into new equipment that can benefit my son at home. The gym's commitment to inclusivity and overall awesomeness earns it a well-deserved 10/10 rating. We Rock the Spectrum is more than just a gym; it's a supportive community that understands and embraces the diverse needs of every child. I highly recommend this extraordinary space to families seeking a place where their children can play, grow, and thrive without limitations.""},{""reviewer"":""Kayla Barr"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a year ago"",""content"":""Such a great environment for kids to explore and learn!

I purchased a $16 cheese and fruit plate that was full of old/bruised fruit. I kindly asked if they could remake the plate because my children have sensory issues and wouldn’t eat the fruit. When they remade it, they gave us less than HALF the food that was on the original plate. When I asked them where the rest of the cheese was, they said “the cheese assortment is at random, that’s just how we do it.” It was insanely busy and I didn’t want to cause any delays for other families, but I am SO disappointed. They served me slivers of apple peels on the second plate, FOUR crackers, and a small pile of Swiss cheese that my children obviously wouldn’t eat. I feel like they did this deliberately, as the employees looked annoyed I even brought the plate to their attention. For $16, food should be fresh and stored properly to avoid bruising and spoiling. They would not give me a refund. Though my kids love this place, I don’t think we’ll be visiting again because of the blatant disrespect.

While my toddler had fun just running around with the big kids, he surprised me and enjoyed the fire tower set-up too. I had to lift him up onto the different platforms to climb it up but he was independent for the different perks up top. With his little 2 year old feet, it was good I was on the swinging bridge with him as I can see his feet getting caught in between the boards and tripping. The fire tower set-up at the top is overall safe and it would be difficult to fall down the climbing tower entrance once you're at the uppermost level. Also appreciate how kids can enter the 2nd highest level and have a wide space to climb up the platform along the sides so multiple kids can climb up at once. I didn't feel like my toddler was in the way when I lifted him up on that platform level.\n\nFor the toddler camp: I feel like there could be more small tables for their kitchen/cafe. I think a small compact play gym for 1-2 year olds with a short slide could be nice in the corner next to the moose on the wall, especially if the kitchen/cafe area and the cushion blocks in the center of the space are all in use.\n\nStaff were very friendly and interacted well with the kids. Will have to try the pizza but the cheese and ham panini I had was tasty, the toasted bread was slightly on the burned side for my preference but the panini was overall good. Haven't tried the wine yet but would like to if my spouse comes with me next time.""},{""reviewer"":""Meredith Patterson Brayley"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""My kids LOVE this place!!!""},{""reviewer"":""kenny macy"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 years ago"",""content"":""Thank you, Kenny!

The pizzas are made in house and were well liked by all.  We were able to decorate the room and are glad they let us do this 30 minutes prior to our party because every minute was needed.  The management was on point, and the staff were so great with the kids.  This birthday adventure was worth every penny!  The only thing I would suggest is to beef up the FAQ section for parties.  We had a lot of questions about set up, and food, drink, etc having never been there.  All of which was answered promptly.  I would also suggest adding an option for an extra 30 minutes.

The playground is designed for younger children, and it’s high-quality, safe, and super engaging.

It’s colorful, interactive, and so thoughtfully designed. My child could spend hours in there exploring and playing. The jump pillow is another favorite—always a huge hit and a great way for kids to burn energy.\n\nThis spot is perfect for birthday parties, rainy days, snowy days—really anytime you need a fun indoor activity.

The swing is positioned directly in the middle of the playroom, blocking the entrance to the play structure, so kids have to dodge it to get in.

I swear they have thought of everything- from a toddler play area to a flight simulator section to the play structure even being parent friendly! Wow!! As a mom of 2 under 2 I am limited with where I can take my kids and it be somewhere affordable, small kid friendly, easy access for parents to play or supervise their kids, and not have to drive 20+ minutes to. My daughter is 21 months and she LOVED it! The toddler area was perfect for containment and getting her comfortable before wanting to venture to the play structure. She wasn’t brave enough to go on her own, so my husband (who is 6 feet tall) went with her. He was able to navigate through the entire play structure with ease (which is SUPER impressive since most structures are small, cramped, and definitely only for kids which IMO isn’t great for the small ones who still need mom or dad’s help). After she went through the structure and down the slides one time we couldn’t pry her away. My husband and I took turns going through with her (I’m 5’3” and had no issues going through which is no surprise since my husband-again 6 feet tall- was able to run around with my daughter as well). She LOVED our time there and we will definitely become members. Perfect timing since winter is right around the corner and we need all the great indoor ideas and places. Will definitely be frequenting here and adding to our weekly routine. My daughter’s birthday is in January and it’s so hard to find things to do indoors that isn’t at our house. We will be renting the event room for sure!! It’s the perfect size and the glass walls allow parents to enjoy themselves and watch their kids. I am SO thankful for a safe, locally run and owned indoor play place for our kiddos. The owners are also such wonderful people. I love that they live here and want to invest in making Castle Rock better. The prices are more than reasonable and honestly could probably be higher so myself (and bank account) are thankful it’s more than affordable. Such an amazing addition to our community! Support local and enjoy your new favorite place to take your kiddos!!\n\nSide note- I am not a fan of snacks with the first ingredient being high fructose corn syrup or that have massive amounts of added sugar. It’s refreshing to see an establishment that provides healthy snacks kids still love. Dried apples (or fruits) are favorites in my house and I haven’t met a kid that doesn’t like them. & thinking of the parents with protein bars, genius!! We need fuel too and rarely do I remember to pack snacks for me so THANK YOU!!\nI also appreciate the no alcohol policy-  as a parent who expects other parents to “parent” their children instead of using play areas for babysitting while they drink, this is the type of place I want to support.\n\nLastly- I’m sorry for the previous review. It was distasteful and not a truthful representation of your facility. I personally know you’re local and native to Colorado .

She spent about half the time playing with other children in the main play area and the other half one on one with the child minder (Amanda!) in their classroom doing activities, games, and art. They provided her with a snack and provided me with free coffee! The only time I had to pause work was to take my daughter to the bathroom. My daughter had a great time and talked about how much fun she had with Amanda the rest of the day.

It is not often as parents that you find somewhere that you can truly relax, knowing your child is contained in a safe play area, with a wide variety of incredibly fun toys and equipment.\n\nEvery time we visit Stomping Grounds, it feels CLEAN! This is a huge differentiating factor for us, and it is why we frequently make the almost 30 minute drive down to Caledonia, rather than going to more local play cafes. Knowing that toys and surfaces have been cleaned well, multiple times per day is a huge relief. The idea of offering several 2 hour play sessions throughout the day, and closing for 30 minutes between each to clean and reset speaks volumes about their priorities.\n\nYou can tell the owners and staff truly care about the wellbeing of the kids. They are engaged, and take extremely good care of the facility. The care and thought they have put in to making the space accessible and fun for ALL kids, should also be recognized. The “zen den,” which is a low stimulation room, is such a great idea, and addresses a clear gap missing from the Play Cafe community.\n\nThey offer a great variety of kid friendly snacks, including a large variety of drinks and treats from local businesses, including several who are owned and operated by women, and businesses who employ individuals with disabilities.

There is something here for every age — from toddlers exploring soft play zones to older kids climbing, sliding, building, and bouncing their way through creative and engaging areas.\n\nThe space is immaculately clean — truly spotless — which is a huge plus when you have little ones crawling and climbing around. The bathrooms are modern, spacious, and sparkling clean, and the adorable party rooms are perfect for birthday celebrations or group get-togethers.\n\nOne of our favorite surprises was the café! It’s not just your typical snack bar — it has a great selection of food and drinks (including coffee for the grown-ups!) and plenty of options to keep kids happy and fueled for more play.\n\nThe pricing is also incredibly reasonable, especially considering it’s all-day play! You can come and go as needed, and I love that it feels very secure — only those who have purchased a ticket receive a personalized entry code, which gives so much peace of mind.\n\nPlay Grounds of LaCrosse has truly thought of everything. It’s fun, safe, clean, and welcoming — a total gem for families looking to burn off energy and make lasting memories. We’ll definitely be back again and again!""},{""reviewer"":""Miranda Ham"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""Edited a month ago"",""content"":""Good place to wear out kiddos. Pros; the jump pad thing is a huge hit- main thing my 9 year old wanted to do and cheap entry price. Cons; lack of supervision, not very clean, basketball court will have balls flying into the jump pad & ninja course, and lack of seating for adults. My son was super disappointed when kids were just sitting on the ninja course for 10+ minutes not playing, when asked nicely if he could go through they ignored him. I wasn't a fan of almost being hit by basketballs multiple times when I wasn't even in the basketball court. Most of the issues could be easily solved if the areas were monitored better and whoever monitors the areas could do general cleaning.""},{""reviewer"":""Chrissy Johnson"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Julie Vang"",""rating"":""3/5"",""date"":""a month ago"",""content"":""Feedback Regarding Party Room Booking Experience:\n\nI’m writing to share some feedback regarding our recent experience hosting a party at your facility, which we booked from 6-8PM.\n\nWhile the children had a wonderful time and we appreciated the timely arrival of the pizzas and the help provided by your on-site staff member, I did want to raise a few concerns that caused some confusion and disappointment.\n\nAccording to the party room description, the booking includes “access to the facility for up to 10 kids for a total of three hours.” I scheduled our party room from 6-8PM (they have allotted time slots for you to select from) with the understanding that the children would have an hour of play after our reserved party room time (8-9PM). However, we were unaware that the facility itself closes at 8PM. This meant that we did not receive the full three hours of access that were advertised.\n\nAre we advised to arrive early to make use of the extra hour of playtime? Additionally, no closing announcement was made to give us a heads-up before the facility shut down. We only became aware of the closing time when I asked to store the birthday cake (ice cream) around 7:45PM, which was also when we were scrambling to locate misplaced car keys while trying to clean up the party room.\n\nWhile your staff member was kind and understanding in the moment, I left feeling disappointed that we unintentionally missed out on a full hour of what we paid for. A simple courtesy email ahead of time outlining the facility hours, or a reminder to arrive early for playtime, would have gone a long way toward clarifying expectations. As it stands, the experience felt misleading.\n\nI’m sharing this in the hope that you might consider updating your communication process for future guests. I hope you’ll take this feedback into account for improving the overall experience.""},{""reviewer"":""Jim Morris"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""Cool place for kids 5 to 10!""},{""reviewer"":""Donavon Diderrich"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""My Daughter loves going here.

It's not practical to have older kids bouncing next to 5 year Olds, it's not practical to have grown men throwing basket balls and accidentally having it hit 3 year Olds in the head.  There should be separate or clear plexiglass walls . I also wish the disabled parking spaces have actual signs because when it's just painted on the ground,  the snow covers it.

I do think this would be a good place to bring your kids if it was to be actively supervised and not remotely monitored. Leaving it up to parents to watch their own children lead to multiple disturbing instances I saw today. A kid literally laid on top of an infant because her mother was supposed to be watching and didn’t. For this reason alone I won’t be returning as often as I had planned! I truly hope they rethink the idea of having it up to the parents. Also the cafe staff is to sanitize on their down time and doesn’t seem to get down time so I’m a little concerned about everything only getting sanitized once a day at the end. The 3 and under is supposed to have no shoes but nobody is actively monitoring it so parents are wearing outside shoes where infants are playing. Also comparing it to an outside park is not the equivalent because you are to pick up after your self and clean up. I would never leave a place messy or not try to clean something up but to actively advertise clean it up yourself is sort of off putting. I do think the cafe prices seemed very reasonable however I was overcharged due to their system having different prices and had a long wait to get a refund for the difference. The website also says they have IPads to be able to buy tickets and that was false they have no iPads at the entrance. I do think if they had it being attended and changed the price discrepancy in the system, put iPads out like advertised it would be a lot better. However after today I wouldn’t be able to go and have peace of mind that a altercation wouldn’t arise. I also witnessed the owners kiddo running around yelling mom without her nearby that was also a little concerning she wasn’t watching her own child.

I am concerned the current style of operation isn’t sustainable long term.\n-The website clearly explains pricing, rules and how to buy tickets. Despite this it seemed many people either can’t read or felt entitled to disregard the rules.\n- Entry was straightforward (clearly listed in the website)\n\n-Pricing is fair and not having to charge adults for admission is a huge pro and draw to take my child here.\n\n-I was anticipating a much more put together space that flowed and was professionally installed.(the 3 play scapes and ninja course were professional grade) The execution/construction was somewhat underwhelming for a commercial space,  particularly the floor in the ninja area with gaps and lips/taping that made it easy to trip.\n\n-I fear this place will not be sustainable without some staff on site to supervise based on the lack of supervision by many parents. The website and signs clearly state no shoes and everyone must wear socks. Most adults were wearing shoes, but still in all the play areas where children were to be wearing socks. To me this does not make sense. Either everyone should be in socks or everyone should be in shoes.  Although my child had on grippy socks a lot of the equipment is plastic and slippery. The floor on the basketball court is very slick and I witnessed multiple wipe outs.\n-There were multiple instances where I witnessed older children rough housing in the 3 and under area which made it unsafe for the toddlers. Examples include climbing on the plastic tree house roof, hanging on the chimney almost ripping it off and jumping off the roof, the door was also ripped off the hinges.\nThe car/bike area is cool but those toys were getting so abused by children outside the posted age rage slamming them into each other, exceeding size and weight limits and no parents redirecting to be found.\nI hope the owners rethink having supervised hours or time blocks to make the experience more enjoyable and safe for all ages and not have all their equipment destroyed in the first week of being open.\nI recognize that the responsibility should be on the individual parents to respect the rules in place to keep this a nice and safe space for all to enjoy, but based on what I witnessed today people can’t be left to their own devices.\nI hope with a few small improvements and individual people being more respectful of the shared space this business becomes a staple in LaCrosse to be enjoyed by all.""},{""reviewer"":""Laurie Bauer"",""rating"":""1/5"",""date"":""7 months ago"",""content"":""The concept of this playground is good. However many older children are running around with no supervision playing in areas that are meant for younger children. It is not a safe situation.  While here, I saw older children slamming the ride toys into other ride toys and the walls. Adults did not take their shoes off and are walking on places where children play on the floor. I saw 7 year olds in the toddler area climbing and standing on the roof of the plastic treehouse with younger children under him. Again, no adult to be seen. The wear and tear on this place is already evident with some doors coming off.\nI think this could be a fun place for kids, but I feel that the owners need to spring for paid supervision to keep the equipment and space in good condition and help keep people safe. It should not be a free-for-all. Maybe there should be set playtimes for certain ages.

They had an Easter event going on which was super cute, eggs and an employee was dressed up as the Easter bunny having fun with the kids.\n\nWhy I gave it 1 star?\n- Lack of cleanliness. This place needs to be deep cleaned and then continued to be deep cleaned on a weekly basis. There was long black/brown hair everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE. All over in the ball pit area.. stuck to balls.. stuck even in some of the toys up in the air. Just gross. Even areas of the toys like the vanity area… the surfaces were visibly dirty with little kid boogers/finger prints. We got there right as they opened so this was not from the day we were there and the traffic of that day. Super disappointing… my child is in daycare so I’m not a germ freak, but this totally creeped me out.\n\n- Upkeep of the toys just isn’t being done or even upkeep at the place. Lots of toys broken and taped back together. The door seal on the back door in the block area is ripped out of the door just hanging there.. toys are broken and taped back together or just broken/missing pieces. I get that with places like this that happens, but I used to frequent Curious Kids Museum in Saint Joe, MI and never have noticed anything in the condition of this place\n\n- There just really isn’t that much to do, it’s pretty small in all honesty…\n\n- The slides are dangerous. Like really dangerous. Even for older kids. Right when we got there two smaller kids went down the green slides and both smacked their heads at the bottom and ended up in full blown tears. My daughter is a scaredy cat so that was enough for her to not be interested in trying… which thank goodness because I didn’t want her going down them. Honestly not many kids use these slides I think because of this.. I watched a few other kids go down and experience a similar experience and not return to them.. there is one other slide that is much better, but still super slippery so you have to be careful""},{""reviewer"":""thang nguyen"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""Do yo have open Sunday esterday""},{""reviewer"":""Laura Penner"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""2 months ago"",""content"":""Awesome place!

There are a lot of small nooks and crannies that my daughter loved but it was kind of hard as a parent to keep track of her through the winding equipment. My only other concern was I brought my 3 month old along too and there was nowhere comfortable to  breastfeed. I sat in a corner near the one bathroom. It was a little strange for a place that is for children, there is no real comfortable place for a mom to breastfeed. I still give four stars because my daughter had an absolute blast and we will be back. I think they’re fairly new so giving them time to work out any kinks""},{""reviewer"":""Imonee Lynn"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""5 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Jason Lu"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""5 months ago"",""content"":""N/A""},{""reviewer"":""Teresa Beatty"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""5 months ago"",""content"":""Fun for young children!""},{""reviewer"":""Jasmina Omerovic"",""rating"":""5/5"",""date"":""5 months ago"",""content"":""My kiddo and I love this place.

They helped me with invitations, a backdrop/balloons, and 2 tables and 6 chairs in total. Over the place itself was nice but if you plan on having a party larger than 25 people, kids included I wouldn’t recommend this place. OVERLY priced! We got the ‘Silver package which is the $400 one, and in total ended up paying well over $700. I have to pay for the kids to get socks, which l thought was included in the price, extra chairs, and pizza. I also had to pay for the extra kids (3) since they only allow 10 for that package. Also, they kept bugging us stuff they didn’t make clear in the beginning. THEN while we're having our birthday party, they were sending over strangers to come check out the room like it was a showcase room or something. Overall 2/10 wouldn’t recommend.

The price was already a good deal for the time, without it though! We went on a Friday and it was just the right amount of energy, kids, and activities it wasn’t packed but there were other kids for my cousin to have a couple play mates. The owner seemed really nice and was very involved and interacting as her daughter was there as well playing amongst the kiddos!!!They also have kid friendly bathrooms, drinking fountain, popcorn machine, for fresh popcorn, cookies, chips, and all types of snacks to keep the kids energetic until dinner time!!!!

This indoor playground is an absolute gem for families with little ones. There’s such a wide variety of toys and play structures that kept our almost 23 month old boy happily entertained the entire visit. From imaginative play to climbing and crawling, there’s truly something for every age and interest.\n\nOne feature we especially loved was the separate, sectioned-off area for children 2 and under. While younger kiddos can absolutely enjoy the entire play area, it’s really thoughtful and comforting to have a space just for them to explore more safely and at their own pace.\n\nEverything was very clean, well-maintained, and clearly cared for—which makes a big difference in a space like this! The snack and drink vending machine was also a much-appreciated bonus for parents and kiddos who need a quick break and refreshment without having to leave the space.\n\nHighly recommend Wild Child to anyone with young kids looking for indoor fun in La Crosse!

The entire facility was spotless, and the staff members were friendly, helpful, and clearly focused on ensuring everyone's safety and enjoyment. It's such a relief to find a place where kids can burn off energy in a secure and well-maintained setting.\nWildchild offers more than just climbing and sliding; the interactive games and obstacle courses added an extra layer of fun and challenge.

Now was it fun for the kids yes. However the bathrooms were gross even my little toddler said that's nasty. It was Saturday and it was super crowded. So I would say maybe they were under-staffed. There are some things they need to take notes on like the swinging wrecking ball for instance. It is a complete safety hazard because there is a string attached to it so you can pull it back in easier but that thing is a hazard. A child can easily get tangled up in it and again there is no attendant making sure it doesn't happen. Now let's go to slide with the tubes. There is an attendant here but only at the top to spray the bottoms with water. There isn't an attendant at the bottom to pass out the tubes so whoever came down the slide can just keep the same tube and keep riding even if it's a line. Also the heat was still on even though it was an extremely warm day. You would think the AC would be on to try and keep down some of the germs. Everyone playing were a sweaty mess. I didn't even play and ending up sweating a bit due to the crowd and heat. This place was too chaotic for my taste as a mom with a small kid. It's ok for older kids but the two shouldn't be mixed at all. The ball pit was overrun with older kids knocking the smaller ones over. Maybe if they hire more workers things would run a lot smoother.

I bring my boys (5yrs 2yrs) to Wild Sprouts and they absolutely love it. My 5yr old son especially loves the daily craft provided. Emma, the owner is amazing, accommodating and super friendly.\nI recently had my daughter's 7th birthday party at Sprouts and it was more than a success. Not only did the girls love playing with all the toys, we took advantage of the spacious party room and enjoyed a runway theme party. Without me even asking, Emma helped me carry my supplies inside, set up my balloon arch (because I had no idea how) helped me set-up AND helped me clean up!

I work from home with my 3-year-old and had been struggling to find a place where she could socialize, explore, and learn through play. She was getting bored at home, and I was overwhelmed with anxiety and guilt because I couldn't give her the attention she needed during my work hours.\nThen I discovered Wild Sprouts during a carnival event at The Learning Experience daycare. I met Emma, the owner, who explained the concept and the incredible membership options. I couldn’t believe it—just $35 a month allows you to bring your child any weekday, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\nMy daughter and Emma’s little one are now best friends, and the peace of mind I’ve gained is priceless. Nearby preschools in St. Charles cost between $900 - $1500 a month, and they often focus on teaching things my daughter already knows, like ABCs and numbers.\nResearch shows that children her age learn best through play. The thought of putting her in a structured classroom with 15 other kids feels like clipping her wings instead of letting her soar.\nIf you’re like me and believe in the power of play, you need to check it out. They offer crafts, special events, and endless opportunities for imaginative play. My daughter is thriving—she does “show and tell” multiple times a day, sings, plays with superheroes, and pretends to be everything from a doctor to a firefighter. She even “cooks” in the play kitchen and “gardens” outside.\nThe daily pass is just $12, and seeing her happy there is priceless.\nP.S. This is NOT a sponsored post.
