The owner is incredibly kind and always takes the time to chat with us, making us feel valued and appreciated.\n\nThe play area itself is fantastic—safe, clean, and filled with fun activities that keep my son entertained for hours. It's clear that a lot of thought goes into providing a space that kids can not only have fun but also learn and grow in. It’s also a great place for parents to relax while their little ones play, knowing that they’re in a safe, well-supervised environment.\n\nWe always look forward to our visits and are so grateful for the positive energy and care the staff puts into making  Play haven such a special place. It's become our go-to spot, and I can't recommend it enough!"

I thought everything went great, we weren't early, left on time, followed all the rules, and cleaned up after ourselves. So much so, the employee there thanked us for cleaning so much as most people don't clean as well as we did. Then, TWO DAYS later and THREE OTHER PARTIES LATER, the owner texts my wife accusing us of damaging her property and leaving a massive sand mess there. Didn't ask us if we happened to notice anything, just straight up accused us of it and then banned us from coming back. As if we wanted to come back after such treatment and accusations. I thought this was such a nice place but I guess I was wrong. We were such loyal customers too, don't come here unless you want to be accused of something you didn't do and talked down too."

At the completion of our event the parents were meticulous about the cleanup. We even went as far as helping with the cleanup of the onsite toys. The lady working there also confirmed that everything looked fine. And yet, we were accused of moving the play structure and leaving sand. I know that 5 year olds are not capable of moving something of that size, so that leaves the adults. NO ONE moved the structure and NO ONE brought in sand. I know this because I was there and saw every single person that entered. I guess the owner did not take into account that there was a later party that same day and two parties on Sunday. We were treated very poorly by the owner of this establishment."

So it was shocking to be accused, 2 days later, of causing \"extensive\" damage. We were respectful of their equipment and the employee working there said everything looked great before we left. The owner also accused of there being sand everywhere because of us. Where would we get sand from?!\n\nAlso, let me note that our party was early Saturday. They had a party after we left and two more parties the day after. There has been three parties since ours.\n\nThe lady is a BAD business owner. She does not know how to value loyal customers."

This is one of the safest layouts. It has 3 levels but no long straight “stairs” so that even if you’re little one were to tumble down them, it wouldn’t be too far and injury is unlikely.\nThey are one of the cleanest as well, you don’t see as much dust and grime in hard to clean places as you do at a lot of places.\n\nThis place is also in great repair. Any time I see something torn up or broken, it is inevitably repaired by the next time I visit. There are some places that have had duct-taped pads, ripped netting, and exposed metal bolts for at least two years that I can confirm. (Don’t go to Buba’s)\n\nFive stars, I can’t recommend this place enough!"

We had a great time. It was safe, it was clean, well maintained, they even have a small part sectioned off for smaller kids. Although my 3 year old was able to play on the big kid side too until like lunch time when it got busy. If you want a nice place to take the kids in the morning then I would recommend. We actually came on a whim with an hour and a half to kill and it really saved the last day of our trip"

They have a sign where it’s a place for kids up to 12 years old to play, though I honestly think it’s better suited for kids between ages 1-10. The older ones might not get as much out of it. I’ve thrown a few birthday parties here for my kids, but their older cousins tend to get bored pretty quickly. That said, my kids absolutely love it (and so do I—at least for them!). The place is always kept really clean, and you’ll see staff walking around making sure everything’s in top shape. The bathrooms are also spotless and they have a diaper-changing station. Plus, they offer free coffee while you’re there, which is a nice touch. Snacks for the kids are available, and prices for entry and snacks aren’t too bad. One tip: definitely bring socks since they’re required, unless you want to shell out for a pair on-site. Parking can be tricky on weekends since it gets pretty crowded, but it’s worth it!"

I get playing with your kids but it’s not them playing with their kids, it’s kids having to wait for the older people to move out of the way. With that being said, I still am giving five stars because the facility deserves it. The bathroom is just beautiful, probably cleaner than the one at even my house let alone a public place that caters to children. The staff is extremely friendly, the facility itself is very clean, lots of places for parents to sit, big enough to follow your toddler or small child through the play places. It’s is so much to be able to interact with the kids, meet other parents/grandparents/guardians and not have to be in the heat. It’s the only time my grandson gets to play with littles and it’s important to socialize your kids even at a young age. This place is incredible. We have been to one other place like this and this one is by far nicer and provides more to do. We will be back and have encouraged friends to take their littles there, too."

The 0-5 have their own space but can also join the bigger playground area. I did notice some of the littles almost getting hurt if they ran under the monkey bar area though. They have free coffee for adults. And a snack shop with reasonable prices. It was very clean and service was great ! Definitely recommend."

They have little carts to help bring everything in and out. You get an hour and a half in the party room which is nice because its not rushed, then we just moved to the public tables to continue playing at the end of the party. The owner also made sure I got all the excess socks of the kids that didnt show since we paid for 12 kids which I appreciated. Definitely recommend throwing a party here.\n\nWe came here a few days ago and my kids are still raving and begging to go back. The staff was all very friendly and all smiles which was nice. There was plenty of seating for parents and lots of snack & drink options. The play area is the biggest, nicest one we have seen out of all indoor playgrounds in the city. It is so well done and they are constantly walking around cleaning and ensuring kids aren't climbing slides etc. My oldest decided he wants his party here so we just booked today and are looking forward to a birthday experience here! We would 100% recommend this playground to everyone, even younger ones. They have a 5 & under area which is the most impressive I've seen as well."

          "content": "If I could give a zero-star rating, I absolutely would. When we arrived, we were informed that we needed to either remove our shoes or wear shoe covers. The woman at the front desk was about to provide us with shoe covers, but the manager or owner intervened and directed her not to, instead offering us socks. Although I was uncomfortable with the idea of taking off my shoes, I complied with his request.\nThe situation became even more troubling when we chose a seat right by the entrance. We noticed that the same manager gave shoe covers to a caucasian woman and her daughter who had just arrived. This raised immediate questions for me—why were they given shoe covers while we were not? The manager had previously warned us that the shoe covers could be slippery and dangerous, yet he still chose to provide them to an older caucasian woman, who was over 70.\nThis behavior not only felt discriminatory but also left me feeling uneasy. It made me question his intentions: Did he not want us to have the shoe covers, or was he recklessly indifferent to the safety of the older woman? It’s disheartening to experience such a stark difference in treatment based on race, and it has left a lasting negative impression on our visit.\n\nHe might attempt to defend himself by saying, \"I'm not racist; I have minorities working for me.\" but it won’t work."

However, was a little disappointed that they converted the basketball play area for seating for parents. Remember this is not about parents comfort. It’s about the kids. It now forces all the kids into the main play area and it’s beginning to feel very overcrowded, which was the main reason I enjoyed coming here was because it wasn’t like some of the other indoor play areas where it was overcrowded. Just my thoughts. But overall, a really great indoor play space."

The building even has cubbies you can put your things up at and they sell snacks and drinks have multiple places to eat and drink and even have birthday parties they also always play kids bop playlist lol it’s definitely a good time and SO CHEAP! I believe it’s 10$ around there per kid adults are free you just sign a waiver for your child and pay 2.50 for each pair of grippy socks you need :) 5/5 stars!!"

I want to tell you what a wonderful experience we all had and how professional and friendly the staff,  consisting of three females and two males,  was. The whole facility was so nice and clean, even the  bathrooms. Not having to worry about the children ages 4, 7 and 7, being able to leave the facility due to the security at the door made the visit even more enjoyable. Cannot wait to go back and again kudos to the great staff."

However, after realizing many of his little friends had other birthday parties the same weekend, I called to request moving our party to a couple of weeks later—well over 30 days in advance.\n\nWhile the person I spoke with was kind, I was surprised to be met with a hard “no” due to their policy. As a business owner myself, I fully understand the importance of policies, but I also believe there should be room for reasonable flexibility—especially when given ample notice.\n\nUnfortunately, this lack of accommodation has led us to cancel the party altogether. We won’t be returning, which is a real disappointment considering how much my son enjoys the space."

I really don’t have any complaints. I do wish the entry was a tad bit bigger bc on cold days you do have to stand outside the door if there are a ton of people in front of you.

The rules are reasonable (no matter what people say); they don’t allow outside food or drink (other than water and baby food) because it helps keep the business running. It is still a business\n3.) The events held by the facility are well planned and thought out. They have activities for all ages\n4.) This is by far the cleanest playground we’ve ever been too, that’s because they care about the business\n5.) Lastly you need to have a 5 min conversation with the owner to understand she cares (a lot) not just about the business, but also her staff and the kids. She started this business for the kids and it shows…..\n\nWe have bought multiple memberships because of all these things. Hope this helps all of those families out there"

I feel like it's geared more towards Littles, but my kid had fun. It was clean and like that parents have a sitting area. Everyone must take their shoes off, so make sure you have socks. Each party is given a sticker with a number, so it correlates with your kid. The price is very reasonable and what I love about it is that 2 adults are admitted with 1 paid child."

I took it to my husband for us to discuss if the membership (that we’ve had before) would be worth it for our family due to their policies and our specific dietary needs. We decided that, even though it’s inconvenient for us and we didn’t like the comments from the staff that day, we’d try purchasing a membership and see how it went from there. If all went well, I’d remove my 1 star review.. I mean, we’ve literally been going here for 6 years.. 1 hiccup/misunderstanding could be navigated.\n\nWELP, was I wrong. I showed up, with kids in tow, and notified that I’ve been BLACKLISTED 😂\n\nLike, me.. of all people and also completely opposite of their feed back. I tried emailing to see if it was possibly a mishap.. no response.\n\nFollow all rules and ensure “they are the right fit for you” and don’t leave a 1 star review.. even if you’ve spent a lot of time here, money here, & word of mouth to support this business.\n\nWord of mouth goes a long way.. and hey.. now my mom group gets a laugh that RAYNEA?? has been blacklisted.\n\nOof 🤣\n\n…..\nI’ve been attending breakaway for 6+ years now. Overall have enjoyed our experience with the play space.\n\nAs of right now, I will no longer take my children here. I’d rather drive to We Rock the Spectrum in Yukon that is super accommodating to their customers.\n\nIf your family has dietary restrictions, you are the minority here and will be treated as such. They do have snacks provided and you can order in pizza to be delivered. You can also eat that pizza inside the facility. BUT  you can not bring in food or eat outside in the car and reenter.\n\nI’ve been doing “car picnics” with my oldest when we come here once she was off baby food. I did not understand their policy (and quite frankly do not agree with it) so once we came back in to do our last 30 mins of time we were informed about the policy and that we would have to repay.\n\nMy kids were loudly upset/crying. Sure, not the funnest thing to hear, but hey.. they are kids that just got told focus on your food so we can go play and now you can’t go play.\n\nWelp, the staff decided that it was ridiculous that my children were upset and chose to talk about them in a very unprofessional and distasteful way. Including the manager. I had forgotten my coffee with all the chaos of trying to leave, so that was awesome to walk into.\n\nIve spent a lot of money here.. my kids enjoy the play place, the owner seems kind.. but the food policy is wack and is completely unaccommodating to children that can’t eat pizza and I also won’t involve myself with staff that will talk negatively about me or my children."

They also have a comfy lounge area for the adults with live security footage to see what your kids are doing! My absolute favorite part is that they don't let your kids walk out of the door. We tried another place last weekend and they had ZERO security. (They also have free coffee) Will definitely be coming again.👍🏻"

          "content": "We've loved Breakaway for the most part, but we've run into so many issues lately.  If you have younger (or smaller) children like I do, you really have to watch them at all times, which can be hard considering it is a pretty large place.  My kids have gotten cornered and pushed, and it's usually by much larger kids.  I understand you are responsible for your kids, but if you don't want to deal with larger kids picking on your little ones, don't bother going.  I will say it is very clean though.\n\nEdit since I can't reply to the owner's response:\n\nI appreciate your response to my feedback today.  I want to emphasize how much I've loved the opportunity to be one of those parents who gets to play with my children at your facility.  If you go back and review camera footage from all the times we've been there, I'm usually getting to play with them.  We love going down the slides together, and I love going to the places I can fit in, haha. Today was not one of those days.  I was working on an assignment from school, but if you watch the footage, you can see that I looked up frequently (way more than the verbal check-ins require) to check on my children.  I've seen them get shoved around by bigger kids frequently, and I have never brought it to your attention because I saw it as an opportunity for them to learn how to handle conflict.  When the boys approached me with any issues, I would say that they can either use their words or walk away.  They usually do really well.  When I was called up there and you let me know what happened, I was shocked.  My son has never reacted that way before.  I wasn't exactly given an option to figure out what happened, you said \"when this happens, we request that you stay with them  or leave.\"  Had I known the other child was 9 years old (both twice my son's age and size) and that he wouldn't let my son out of the foam pit and that he and his sister had been picking on him before that, I would have mentioned something to you.  I have been working with my boys to teach them how to handle conflict on their own.  You even mentioned yourself in your response to my review that you get frustrated that other people do not supervise their children, but it's your business...what is stopping you from doing more to force parents to do that?  Regardless of whether Breakaway is a licensed childcare facility or not, an establishment that caters to children has a duty to ensure their safety and well-being.  While I understand that busy days present challenges, it is not an excuse.  You can lower the capacity threshold if this is an issue, right?  Moving forward, I would just earnestly request you to reconsider your approach to addressing these issues."

I asked if I could take JUST my son out to the car if he gets hungry then come back in, and was told there would be a reentry fee. The front desk person was polite but completely unhelpful.\n\nI understand this review isn't applicable for everyone, but for our family it's a +30 minute drive to come here and a $26 entry fee, so between that and the gas it's a bit of a deal breaker. (They DO have healthy snacks options, he just won't eat their options/brands 😭)"

There are plenty of seats and a tv showing cameras that are in the play area so you can always see your kiddos. They have snack and drinks you can purchase and they are very reasonably priced. They also have a partnership with a pizza place which made it nice not having to leave to grab lunch before appointments. Overall, it is a very nice facility. There is a cute little town area and a little play area for little ones that was perfect for my 9 month old. The other equipment is great for my five and three year old. I highly recommend!"

Everything is covered in foam, netting is secure and safe, boards in the play place are securely bolted down and thickly padded, and the trampoline is maintained so the springs aren't exposed.\n\n3. The staff is amazing! They check in and out all the kids and make sure the parents have a matching tag.\n\n4.

My kids been wanting to go back often so I renewed my membership. This place is clean and very well maintained. I been to a lot of these indoor places across the country and I will say this is the most comfortable and versatile indoor playground.  👌 ❤️\n\nThis place is a great indoor place for my 5 and 7 year old,  but one of the younger girls (blonde) in the front desk need to have an attitude adjustment. I have a membership there and I been coming here for almost a year.

My child then tried to get in it and was pulled out violently by the other kid. The staff did not notice until the seen me trying to stop the situation.\nI watched them “sanitize” and they just spray lysol up in the air not really focusing on anything or watching to make sure children aren’t in the way.\nI watched both staff members go to the restroom at the same time leaving the front desk unattended and people waiting to get in for 5-7 mins\n\nTo many parents sitting on the couch on their phones not paying attention to their children\n\nThis could be an amazing place just needs a bit of work, and maybe better employee training"

They told me 13.00! I said last time it was 11.00 they just stood there and stared at me! Two young girls. I said well I guess I will have to leave then because all  I have is 11.00 they said sorry. I decided to call my husband to come back all the way here to bring me 3.00 . I told them he would be here soon and they made my 20 month old and I wait inside the gated area for 12 minutes geezers! Instead of letting us inside ! The girls were whispering back and forth.  I will never ever step foot back in this place again! They charge a clean up fee as well but the children's play area looked like tornado so they never cleaned it."

I also observed how they treated other party attendees and they were rude to them as well. I believe they said they would call the police on a lady and she was just standing there talking to other party goers. From my observation they seem to have a problem with people of color. This was my last time supporting this place I've been here before and everytime those two are there they give me a hard time. I will spend my hard earned money where my business is wanted. Besides the rude customer service the kids enjoy themselves."

Understandably, they have a penalty for rebooking on a different date, but they took our deposit instead.  We had a reschedule expecting a small loss in the deposit (penalty as the website says), but they ended up taking our deposit.  What's the incentive now for rebooking if we lose the same money as someone who completely cancels?  We spoke to the employee there about our disagreement with the decision and the owner was there reinforcing the decision.  I think this is bad practice and their policy is unclear and ambiguous.  No consideration for loyalty to the business with three previous bookings.  If we could have rebooked with a partial loss of the deposit we would have been fine with it.  We won't be booking any more birthdays here unfortunately."

Coincidently neither that child's parent nor any staff was around. I observed the incident from across the way. Now I had been watched the whole time I was there. I realized it was because we were the only ones there who did not look like everyone else.  In fact, the Manager had approached me at one point and asked me if we were leaving prior to this incident, and I said no. (Never figured out why he would ask that.) Later I thought, well, maybe it was a hint and we should have left then. I let the child and the parent (who told me I was ignorant because I did not want to speak with him) know that the bullying was unacceptable behavior. I assured the manager that that we would not ever return. I feel they probably prefer that certain people not patronize their business anyway."

The price hasn’t changed and a lot of the soft mats have tape applied to them and the trampolines are sagging. It needs a refresh and maintenance.

The lady at front was super helpful and the staff was really sweet but I feel like more should be done for making sure children are safe. It’s clear that parents do not pay the slightest attention to their kids here. There were a group of kids throwing objects at other kids faces and after confronting the mom, she did nothing but sit there while her children still continued to throw toys and balls at other kids faces. It’s definitely not the staffs job to parent or control other people’s kids but there should be some sort of protocol for removing children if they aren’t being nice to others or at least make the smaller area for smaller children only. It was disgusting watching older toddlers throwing objects at infant faces and nothing was done."

There’s a quiet area, toddler play area, a nursing mothers room (with seats that are actually comfortable to nurse in) cameras so parents can supervise their kids from the lobby and not have to climb up to see what their kids are doing. All my kids ages 1-10 always have a blast. The staff are so friendly and the place is always clean."

The facility, including the restrooms, was all very clean. They even have a nice, safe, tucked away play space on the ground level for the really little ones to enjoy. If everyone needs a quiet place to relax or play quietly, they have that too, including accommodations for nursing moms. Plenty of comfortable seating and tables too.

They went above and beyond to accommodate us! There is plenty of comfortable seating including a quiet room and chargers for all phone types scattered throughout! There is a camera system with large display screen to view the back area of the play space! There were free arcade games! We had a great time and my children loved it!

I joined them for a bit (those slides are so much fun!), but after some crawling around, I was happy to relax with a drink in a comfortable chair while they played to their hearts' content. My older grandkids had just as much fun, especially with the playground and video games. The whole atmosphere is bright, fun, and full of energy, and the space theme adds such a cool, imaginative vibe. I can’t wait to take them again!\""

I saw the employees vacuuming, taking the trash out, and checking the bathrooms regularly. All of the employees were very kind and friendly. Even the other parents were wonderful and handled little kid disagreements/rowdiness very well.\n\nOn top of that, it was a great place to get some work done while my little one played. Comfy seats, fast internet, and we were able to bring in our lunch. So grateful to have had this experience!"

My grand daughter asks \" plz Don't cut it. \" the wrkr proceeds to cut string to balloons claiming the weight ( $3 at store) doesn't come with it. WHAT?  We paid over $400 for 90min & u want to make a kid sad cause u can't spare a $3 weight? Yea that ruined our whole experience.  So mayb if u see a kid walking with 4'5 balloons please let the weight go. If u get to it b4 kid wants it fine but to take it from bday kid was ridiculous."

Today I had to complain twice to an employee about a group of bigger kids harassing my son. They punched him in the stomach a couple times and I mentioned it and asked how I should handle it - to which she said she had already had to talk to the father once. Then it happened again my son ran up to me holding his head and nose because they hit him again. I talked to the father after that time and he talked to the boy. Then I heard my son yelling so went to see and they had chased him again and he said they spit at him and were chasing him. We decided to leave after that because he was too worried to even play and I was on edge. I don’t feel it was fair that we left because my son was uncomfortable when there was no repercussion for the older kids. I was told the cut off age is 12 but that seems much too old considering the majority is 3-6 it seems and some of these kids were twice his size. I hate to leave a negative review because we do love coming here but I feel that something else should have been done."

Still, the Play Pit's cozy antique rocking chairs and furniture, complemented by the modern-chic aesthetic, make you feel like you brought your kids over to your cute friend's house to play. It's as cozy and comfortable for adults as it is entertaining for their kids. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\nThe historic architecture enchants your visual sense, and it is such a great example of adaptive reuse with what would feel like a contradiction in housing a playground, but it fits oh-so-well. We are used to traveling an hour to Edmond for a similar center, and although Edmond's is larger, the aesthetic at the Play Pit appeals to the adults more and makes it a comfy place to hang out and not feel like you are surrounded by raging children. 😌\n\nThe staff is friendly, and it always smells fresh in there. On more than one occasion, I have witnessed them actively cleaning surfaces and the air with Lysol and other anti-bac/viral products.\n\nFinally, with the price of $13 for the first kid and $10 for additional kids and re-entry allowed, it makes for a fun family experience you can feel good about! 🙌🥳 They also offer monthly passes, birthday parties, and private parties.\n\nLast, but not least they offer an assortment of snacks and coffee for sale, in addition to bringing your own food if you keep it out of the playground areas. 🛝"

Unfortunately, my daughter notified me on our way home because the women scared her, and she was afraid to tell me when we were there.*** FYI all this happened while I was sitting at the chair area wish I would have been made aware of while we were there to notify staff then***.                                          I turned back to inform the employees, and I ran into this woman in the parking lot and politely questioned her. She started yelling at me, saying she was being “stern.”I'm sorry, but that woman had no right to yell or be stern with children who are not hers. If my children were at fault, the staff should have been notified. Unfortunately, after the incident, I was told the staff could not do anything since my child did not make them aware of the incident when it happened. To the women that felt comfortable yelling “Get Out!” To an 8-year-old in a kids' indoor park while they were playing, I’m sorry your heart is broken!"

I'm not new to the indoor parks, my family has been using them for years when we travel.\n\nI do give this one a 4 star. I LOVE that there is NO ARCADE! However the price is rather steep in comparison to other larger indoor parks, and the price does not change despite how close to closing it is when you arrive. $14 per kid for all day, or $14 per kid for an hour.\nThe food option are limited and also quite steep in comparison. But with no arcade in sure they need to make up the income somewhere.\n\nVery friendly staff, and always changing it up to keep the toys fresh and interesting.\nBathrooms..... Issue!!    Carpets, kids, BAD AIM, and only socks!!"

It’s by far the best toddler friendly indoor playground in okc.\nWhile I appreciate the effort to bring new things in, the new ninja area makes it difficult for us to continue supporting the business\n\nOur 3 year non verbal doesn’t understand why he has to wait his turn and can only be in the area for a short time in order to let the other kiddos have their turn which results in big melt downs due to his neurodivergence.\nBringing in something new, tailored to older kids with lots of rules makes playbox a lot less toddler friendly than before, which made it so special.\n\nStill giving 5 stars because the place and the team have always been amazing! Just really sad we can no longer enjoy it\n\nWe are hoping to be back as regulars when our little is out of the toddler phase in a few years and can hopefully understand and follow the rules"

My boys were hungry but I couldn't bring myself to buy them chocolate and soda. Some healthier options should be presented. 2) price. $14/kid was a bit steep but I'd be willing to return so maybe they're priced fairly"

The first time we had nothing but good things to say, but after this last party we left feeling very dissapointed at the way we were treated. We very much felt like inferior guests and undervalued customers. When we arrived for our kids party there was a sign on the door saying they were closing early for a private party. Well…part of the draw to this facility is that after your allotted party time, your guests can stay and play as long as they want. Instead we were rushed out. When talking to the manager she claimed that she called us, yet neither my husband nor I have any calls or voicemails from the playbox. She offered to give us a couple passes for free play, but we felt this warranted bigger measures as this was our child’s birthday that was cut short unknowingly to us who paid a lot of money for our guests to continue to stay and play. 2 free play passes does nothing, how about making it right? It was embarrassing, even our guests were upset. It takes a lot for us to complain and I understand mistakes happen but there was no compassion or understanding for our frustrations from the staff, only a lack of accountability. In the future, if private parties are booked and there are previously booked parties shortly before, the staff should confirm with the surrounding parties and if people are unhappy, then they should be allowed to back out of their reservation and book their child’s special day at a facility that will be equally accommodating. Please keep in mind before booking your kids special day here, that their day can be cut short without your knowledge in order to accommodate a private party who will provide more money to the business."

          "content": "This place taught me that it is definitely worth the drive to go to one of the indoor play places in Edmond. This one in Mustang has a center section that kids can run through, but it is small, and is only 2 levels. It is short, so adults can't really go through it with the children. Around the center structure are other play areas. There is a fire station with nothing in it. There is a school room with nothing in it. By nothing, I mean 3 walls, and nothing even on the walls. There is a market with a few groceries, 2 carts, a cash register, and, inexplicably, a toy oven. There are no pots and pans or cooking utensils. There is a section in the back with toys for little ones. There is a food truck that has no play food or drinks or anything else that came with it out of the box. There is another kitchen with no items to play with it. It makes no sense. Why have these things? They just made my grandchildren wander around, looking for the missing ingredient to this place, which is fun. There is an awful lot of fun missing. We won't be back."

Other play places we went to had broken parts or ripped vinyl, but this one did not.\n\n- It’s well set up. It has a large play area with great slides and fun tunnels. It also has a large carpeted area around the outside of the main playground equipment to play if it’s too busy. It also has a great toddler area for your little ones and play shops (Firehouse, School, and Market).\n\n- Good Location. Didn’t feel unsafe when arriving or leaving.\n\nI highly recommend you try this place out next time you’re looking for an indoor play place.\n\nSide note: I was only able to get a photo of one side of the equipment. I wasn’t able to get photos of the rest of the area since other children were playing there."

I asked if we could just use one of the play passes (for two kids) or have a discounted price since we would only would get to play for 30 min because of the early closing. Nope. I explained that I had called just a bit before getting there and no one mentioned the early closure. Still nope. Very rude and unhelpful. Terrible customer service."

Ultimately we had fun, but there were a few sections of the playground that felt a little dangerous for smaller children especially when it was crowded (even with me watching closely.) I think the pricing doesn't quite match the facility at the moment when compared to locations like Play On Main. I'm eager to see what changes will be made as they approach their grand opening!"

We are so thankful for a business like this in Altus! I personally can’t wait to see how it grows as you continue to add onto it."

The seating isn’t comfortable,as well as it was pretty warm in there and I wasn’t even up moving around. I also didn’t know we would be charged for socks which I’m not really worried about. But what bothers me the most is I have a 5 year old son who has autism and has his favorite bunch of toys. He forgot his small sack with his toys so we went back in to look they said if they found it they would reach out and they did!! But unfortunately we live 2 hours away and both work full time I offered to pay them to mail his toys back to us and left my phone number. Still no word from the owner and the lady at the desk answering the phone made it seem like it’s not likely to happen. Just kind of upset because I know I’d do it for someone else if they were in my shoes😊"

After 30-35mins of play time a staff member announced over the intercom that they were closing in 25mins (5:00pm) despite that they officially close at 6:00pm. Being confused I asked what was going on and was told that they had a private event and they needed the hour to clean. This made our family very upset because we were NEVER told that we're going to have to leave in a hour after getting there and paying around $75. When I stated this to the older woman behind the counter she told me there was a sign on the door explaining about the event. We read the main sign on the door when we first arrived and the sign she was talking about was NOT there . The lady had ZERO care, and wasn't concerned when I told her we were never told about this event because WE WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A \"DAY PASS\" FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS THAT LASTED ONLY A HOUR. She pretty much blew us off as if it was our fault and that it wasnt an issue we werent warned about the event. Multiple families we spoke to walking by afterward were also NEVER told about the private event and were quite upset as well. This issue was 100% avoidable, and/or at the very least been told by the staff that they were sorry showing a little sliver of remorse. In the end we felt as if we got scammed! We will not be back!"

The manager was called by the staff and the manager told the 17 year old employee Hayden to call the police and tell them we had exhortation going on. The White police office came in and started talking to me a Black woman in a negative hostile tone and the officer did not try to justifiably resolve the issue. The officer just repeated to me what the 17 year old told him to. I will never eat there again, thank God they did not call CPS on us.. If you are Black. Walk on egg shells in the Kid Galaxy OKC"

Such a nice change of pace from most play places who get hung up on silly stuff. We had a wonderful afternoon at Play Galaxy and will be back!!"

There is absolutely no safety at the doors. This is the only indoor playground we have been to that doesn’t have at least a safety gate at the door. People walking in and out of the building, did not feel safe for my kiddos. I didn’t see any cameras in the building either. Uncomfortable seating for the adults and all of the tables were already taken. Playground had several rips/tears/taped up areas already. Concrete floors throughout the building, saw a girl come off the slide and hit her knee hard. Several of the arcade games were broken and unsafe, claw machines double charged us. For this place being brand new, there are too many issues to count."

As parents it’s our job to supervise our children but I appreciate the staff being observant as well. Great job!"

The facility was great for the kids but for mom & dad, it was stressful.\nFor starters, right off the back, I was not informed you had to pay a fee to bring in your own drinks until we were bringing in water & lemonade. Per the party pack, it only mentioned food.\nSecondly, having absolutely no time to set up was ridiculous. When mom & dad finally got everything set up, it was time to eat do cake and presents so we could be out of there in time for the next party.\nThird, once again, the party package only mentions additional charge per kid. No where does it mention an extra charge for adults so when we invited everyone, we were unaware we would be charged for them. Again, found this out while I was there. Then I was informed the extra adults would be charged a lower price than what we were actually charged!\nFourth thing, I told them two or three times I wanted large pizzas. Somehow I still was brought XL & charged for XL.\nLastly, I didn’t love having someone bothering me the whole time. I was told I was over 3 kids & I absolutely knew I wasn’t, so I spent half my time trying to do a headcount to see what kid I was missing just for them to realize I was only 1 over, which I had told them over the phone earlier in the week, I would be."

          "content": "Reviews are skewed.  Was offered $2 off prior to entering (per kid) to give a five star review. I took the deal, but am following up with my true review, instead of my bought one.\n\nTook my 4 and 1 year old here on a Saturday because my oldest had been asking to go (she had been before with an aunt, this was my first time). The space itself it very large, but a lot of it seems wasted. The play gym is okay, mostly places to crawl around. There are two slides, which were just okay. One enters to a ball pit, but the slide stops the kids before they get to the so-so filled pit. (The balls also bunch in the corner). An attendant at other kids’ gyms is there to push the balls back. I will say the toddler area was great. A smaller slide with a ball pit and things for little movers to crawl around; however apparently the older kids thought it was cool too… so we couldn’t really enjoy the space.\n\nSecurity/children check out is better at other places. And there were some children climbing ON TOP of the structure, which an employee (or parent for that matter)  wasn’t around to correct.\n\nAfter all while my older was done with the gym and just wanted to play the arcade games (which I had heard from aunt was probably what was going to happen). My husband bought a play card. Can you guess what the minimum dollar amount was for a card. $25! Wuuut. I was guessing $5-$10. $25 seems a little desperate (in addition for bribing for reviews). I suppose it’s nice you can use that money for games AND concessions… but we couldn’t get the card to swipe on a lot of games and some of the rides were broken. 😐\n\nOverall for value, entertainment, and safety I think the place is just okay. For me it’s ranked three out of the four I’ve tried in the area. I have not yet been to We Rock the Spectrum.  I think the next time my kiddo starts asking to go here, I’ll just take her to an arcade…\n\nMoney spent was $24.55 for admission for two kids and two adults (after $4 off) and $25.00 game/concession card. For 2 hours of play."

If you go all the way to the top of the play structure you can see the top of some of the tunnels and they are CAKED in dust. They probably haven't been cleaned in years. We went to the snack bar and asked how much the drinks were and the guy working had an attitude and was rude when we asked prices since they don't have any prices displayed.

It smelled clean, it felt clean, it was awesome. Best I’ve seen it. I was thoroughly impressed. The employees were constantly busy cleaning if they weren’t helping families.  I never saw anyone just standing around. Outstanding. We were there for 4 hours today!\n\nSpecial shout out to Mr Don- he was so kind and helpful to the kids, and also kindly corrected kids when needed (walking UP the slides instead of going down, etc).  Extremely friendly\n\nPrevious:\nWe recently moved to the area, and I needed somewhere to take my kids when it was too hot to be outside, and I didn’t want to drive into the city.  Bubba is AWESOME.  My 4 and 7 year old both run around for HOURS, and have a blast.  I like that there are multiple seating options for the parents (though having tables that don’t rock would be a huge plus), and that parents can play as well.  The security checkpoint at the exit is amazing- you aren’t leaving with kids who don’t match your code!\n\nThe staff are always doing something- checking people in, cleaning, putting balls back.  They are friendly and helpful. Bathrooms are clean (HUGE perk to a kids Playzone), snacks are available and fairly priced.\n\nThis place is perfect for when I need a few hours to get some stuff done, or just want to read while my kids run out their crazies. We’ve been multiple times, and will continue to return as long as Bubba maintains the current conditions!"

Been here over an hour and see no one cleaning. Also, there are too many blind spots with no staff watching out. We have definitely visited safer indoor playgrounds. We will not be back to this one regardless of the convenience. Leaving pictures of the popped balloons I picked up myself."

She takes the security serious so don’t lose those stickers and more importantly your kids. They also started having employees there to facilitate the slides and to make sure people are safe. The ball vacuums are broken and have been for some time and but it’s still a hit for the toddlers to just hold the button down. Finally, some of the green cushions seem to have been moved into the ball pits I don’t think it was intentional but apart from that as long as the kids have safe fun this place is a great option."

No one knew or cared that we had ordered food. I will never book here again, totally pointless. We had family from out of town who came expecting food and we had nothing- not even an apology from the staff for completely f’ing up. We were not even given the time we paid for- they were 15 minutes late into cleaning the room, we had to set up, didn’t get our food and barely drinks, plus we were expected to leave out of the room, even though they did not give us the time we had PAID for. We should have gotten the 15 minutes they had taken out of the time we had originally. UNPROFESSIONAL! Don’t waste your time, please take your business to Breakaway Indoor playground in Edmond! Parking is better, staff is better and actually present so your children don’t get hurt, and their equipment isn’t breaking.\n\nAlso it is policy you place orders upon arrival- no one asked us what we ordered and I presented it three times to four staff members. The staff doesn’t even follow policy. The manager, courtney, will argue with you and explain to you why it’s anyone fault but theirs! She will block you on Facebook so you can’t make a Facebook review, they will lie on all the reviews you make and they won’t get back with you when you ask to speak to someone higher up. They even came and found me while I was playing with my son to make sure we “didn’t leave without paying.” Unprofessional in many ways, but how could I possibly leave without paying if they’re supposed to be a check-in and check-out facility FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN?!"

I was trying to supervise my son in the ball pit, but the setup made it nearly impossible to do so safely.\n\nAdditionally, the overall condition of the playground was very concerning. The flooring was in terrible shape—buckling in several areas—which created serious tripping hazards. I witnessed multiple children fall due to the uneven surface. It’s simply not a safe environment for children.\n\nI cannot recommend this place based on our experience. Safety and customer service should be top priorities, and unfortunately, neither were present during our visit."

There was no employees besides the one at the front desk who was in her phone the entire time. While being  there there the same child pushed my 6 year old into a wall and my 11 month old down and took toys from him. You would think they would have other employees to help supervise."

I went to the front where the person is at checking in people and supposedly watching (worker was on her phone And never even looked up) the entrance/exit and told her that I could not locate my granddaughter could she please look on camera and show me where she was at.  Lady wasn't very concerned and finally got up and started showing me the camera footage. While looking at the camera footage a lady walked in outta mall and asked if anyone was missing a kid. Said they saw a little girl half way down the mall that had only socks on.  I took off through the mall to find her.  The worker never said anything didn't try to go with me and help look, nothing.  I found her and went back to playground to get my friend and the other kids.  Still no one at the playground said anything to me.  I asked to speak with manager/owner and was told they weren't there.  I asked when would they be available worker said they never come in.  Told me I needed to go on web site and contact them that way.   So I went to web site but there is no way to contact anyone on there.  I have called back up there and worked said \"sorry there is no way to contact them\"."

But the bathrooms were out of soap and the employees said they were out and the owner was out of state. Seems kinda gross to me.  They did have handsanitizer... but that was your only option. The parent area is tight but all in all adequate to watch your kids. Employees were helpful when my kid lost her socks.  They found every other kids socks but not mine, so we had to buy new ones.  Other then that they were busy playing card games and doing their own thing.  For me and the needs of my kids it is a great place to keep them entertained so my husband and I could tag team christmas shopping.  I wouldn't go here for any other reason.  But,  to have one of us shop and the other to let the kids play and swap it worked perfect. Comparing this to the indoor playgrounds in the malls in California, it was pitiful but for a place to contain  your kids... this was much easier then the playground on the first floor."

The ball pit needs more balls, there’s not nearly as many as there used to be and a fair amount are crushed. The air cannons on the top level need a better way to get the foam balls up there. As is the kids have to climb up with what they can carry in 1 hand because climbing requires the other. They offer a punch card and they offer a free session once it’s full. We’ll be back."

That’s even though I showered her pictures of children the size of mine that utilized her equipment.

The price for play used to be $10. I don’t think the cost is worth it. The toys are dated and cheap, even the music is some off brand music. They haven’t updated to warrant this increase at all imo. I am not the only one, other parents in line yesterday also seemed a bit shocked at the price jump. Hopefully it is just temporary, because I can’t justify that anymore."

The owner is incredibly kind and always takes the time to chat with us, making us feel valued and appreciated.\n\nThe play area itself is fantastic—safe, clean, and filled with fun activities that keep my son entertained for hours. It's clear that a lot of thought goes into providing a space that kids can not only have fun but also learn and grow in. It’s also a great place for parents to relax while their little ones play, knowing that they’re in a safe, well-supervised environment.\n\nWe always look forward to our visits and are so grateful for the positive energy and care the staff puts into making  Play haven such a special place.

I thought everything went great, we weren't early, left on time, followed all the rules, and cleaned up after ourselves. So much so, the employee there thanked us for cleaning so much as most people don't clean as well as we did. Then, TWO DAYS later and THREE OTHER PARTIES LATER, the owner texts my wife accusing us of damaging her property and leaving a massive sand mess there. Didn't ask us if we happened to notice anything, just straight up accused us of it and then banned us from coming back. As if we wanted to come back after such treatment and accusations. I thought this was such a nice place but I guess I was wrong. We were such loyal customers too, don't come here unless you want to be accused of something you didn't do and talked down too."

At the completion of our event the parents were meticulous about the cleanup. We even went as far as helping with the cleanup of the onsite toys. The lady working there also confirmed that everything looked fine. And yet, we were accused of moving the play structure and leaving sand. I know that 5 year olds are not capable of moving something of that size, so that leaves the adults. NO ONE moved the structure and NO ONE brought in sand. I know this because I was there and saw every single person that entered. I guess the owner did not take into account that there was a later party that same day and two parties on Sunday. We were treated very poorly by the owner of this establishment."

The owner also accused of there being sand everywhere because of us. Where would we get sand from?!\n\nAlso, let me note that our party was early Saturday. They had a party after we left and two more parties the day after. There has been three parties since ours.\n\nThe lady is a BAD business owner. She does not know how to value loyal customers."

All my kids ages 1-10 always have a blast. The staff are so friendly and the place is always clean."

If everyone needs a quiet place to relax or play quietly, they have that too, including accommodations for nursing moms. Plenty of comfortable seating and tables too.

They went above and beyond to accommodate us! There is plenty of comfortable seating including a quiet room and chargers for all phone types scattered throughout! There is a camera system with large display screen to view the back area of the play space! There were free arcade games! We had a great time and my children loved it!

The toddler area was perfect for my 2-year-olds, who couldn’t get enough of the play structures—and even tried out the bigger slides! I joined them for a bit (those slides are so much fun!), but after some crawling around, I was happy to relax with a drink in a comfortable chair while they played to their hearts' content. My older grandkids had just as much fun, especially with the playground and video games. The whole atmosphere is bright, fun, and full of energy, and the space theme adds such a cool, imaginative vibe. I can’t wait to take them again!\""

My son was excited to paint a gift for his dad for father's day. However, from the moment we walked in the tension in air was ugh, why are here kinda feeling. My son dropped a mug that I had to pay half of. Which wasn't a big deal,  but the fact my son wasn't sure what he was supposed to do after picking out his gift, leading to him nervously dropping the cup. This was our first time here, and I literally had to prompt all conversation with the young lady working today. If your shy I get it, but the fact that I approached the desk and you are on phone tells me all I need to know. This place literally has a giant playground in it, and seems to be a place for kids. However, the young lady didn't seem to be very happy kids where there. She didn't engage much with my son, and was just very put off by having to help more than handing us a tray with paint on it. I just wish this would have been more of fun experience with my boys, instead it became a super akward moment, and not fun memories."

I'd definitely say not a place for cleanfreaks because there are paint splotches everywhere.\n\nI did note some minor safety issues that cause me to knock down a star. There were no outlet covers in the baby/toddler area of the playplace and the gym had zipties broken, causing a wirepiece to swing freely. They don't have staff monitoring the play area or at all, they all were just behind the desk. They also have a sink that seems broken and it just has a shirt draped over it."

They do offer paint gowns so your lil one doesn't get dirty and you can take your paint pieces home by allowing them to dry on the rack. They do have snacks and drinks if you're needing something for yourself or the kids. Definitely coming back and my son loved it so much 😀."

She wasn't super rude or anything,but she could have been a little kinder to the kids and more patient. All in all seemed great!"

He had a blast getting tired on the playground before relaxing with some paint! We will definitely be back!"

The gals working there were great and the play place was very clean. Even my teenagers liked it. The ONLY two issues i had was 1. there is a wall of boxes right next to the front door which really takes away from the asthetic of the place. It ruined the vibe a bit and appeared sloppy. 2. This place has very very tall industrial cielings, so if you lose an inflated balloon, they charge an astronomical amount of money. My advice to the owner is if losing balloons is an issue, use the money charged from other people to place a net over the private party areas at least so that its less of a stress. What is a little kids bday party without balloons? But my daughter STRESSED about ANY CHILD possibly touching the balloons on the table. Mind you, this was a 4 year olds bday party. Seems like a HUGE hassle over something that can be helped. She shouldnt have had to worry about a silly thing like balloons. She paid a decent amount for that space... she shouldnt be worried about stupid things like a lost 250$ balloon."

Then the brushes were cut up. To top it off the ladies seemed very annoyed that I asked for a bag for my clay items, and that I had asked for glitter that was advertised to be included in a kit. I got some random horse stickers for my daughters rainbow box lol I really could’ve spent the same amount of money at the store and gotten a  better quality experience for my daughter"

I've only ordered the pizza and wings, which are pretty good for a kids' place. I'm not sure about the other food items. They have an \"adult only\" area, so if you need to get away from the noise, you can sit there and still have a view of the play area."

We were ready to go and the girl checking the stamps to get out was the same doing the prizes. In the beginning I felt bad for her and was patient, I was in line and I know she saw me and my kids, but then decided to help the lady and kids behind me. I raised my hand to let her know we were first and all she did was to mock me. When she got close to me finally I was able to ask her nicely if she could check my kids points inside the cards, she seemed upset and just nodded. After that she was talking to people getting out of the place just not paying attention to any of us trying to get the prizes. At the end we decided to leave and not even try since she was so busy and was rude to us not once but 3 times. I understand she was busy but she didn’t even try, she didn’t keep up, and she didn’t care. And when we were getting out she didn’t even bother to ask for the stamps in our hands, she was too busy chatting with another couple. It was a good experience, my kids had fun, until this. Please hire more people. You could tell this girl hated being there."

I’m from Colorado and a place similar to this (Kids Empire) is $20 a child starting at age 1. Paying $6 for a 2 year old and two adults left us money to play the arcade games instead of fighting our toddler to stay away from them. When it came time for lunch we checked out the food counter expecting nothing better than Chuck E Cheese, but wow were we impressed. The pizza actually tasted good, the fried pickles were crispy and perfectly breaded, and the condiment station had everything we needed. I’m so sad we are leaving to go back home because we would be here several times a week otherwise. As it stands, Kid Mania fulfilled its purpose of tiring out our adhd 2 year old so we can start out 12 hour drive before nightfall. You can guarantee I’ll be back if we find ourselves in Ft Worth again, my husband will insist since he had as much fun as our son."

The tunnels had a smell to them, like throw up that wasn't properly bleached. Had to pay to get my toddler in, yet he could only play in a very small area that also smelled and had gum and candy stuck to it. There weren't any employees keeping track of where the older kids were playing, so older kids kept coming into the area that was specifically for 3 and under, which is a safety hazard. Most places would let a child under two in for free; I don't mind paying for my toddler if there is a special area for toddlers, but I need to know that the area is going to be safe for my child."

There is an adult quiet area upstairs, which is great, and more arcade games upstairs for adults and bigger kids. It is 12.99 for kids 3-12, and adults are $1.

Half of the building is pretty much an entire obstacle like course that has a ton of mini activities within including; swings, slides, among other activities within. I have been here when it is super busy and just recently when there wasn't hardly anyone there. When it's crowded it can be a bit overwhelming, just a warning. There is a smaller portion of the obstacke area that is meant only for toddlers so they dont get ran over by the bigger kids and adults can go in all areas of the obstacle course. Socks are REQUIRED, they do have socks you can buy but ofcourse are gonna be more expensive than what youd get from a typical store, so keep that in mind. Luckily they will mark you and anyone else you come in with a numbered stamp so that nobody else can leave with your children and there is in fact a loud alarm for anyone that tries to leave without being let out by an employee. There is an upstairs area that has a more enclosed room for parents to watch over the little ones as well as a small arcade that can be used with their kids mania card you can get from a machine. There is food and drinks and you can't bring in your own but I so far haven't seen any issues with bring in a birthday cake [whether you have bought a birthday event package] of your own but not sure if that is per what employee is working or not, so take it with a grain of salt.  I haven't gone to the restroom here so unsure of the state it's in, sorry."

The games are very expensive, some are 1.75 for a simple spinning game. Also could not use it on some rides. If you have any left over on multiple cards you cannot combine. Multiple machines were broken. Gym is very clean and multiple employees are always making rounds. Multiple areas for sitting and even a quiet room for adults. Good place for parties but I would skip the game cards."

          "content": "Overall, this is a decent place to take my older child to play. However, I do wish that staff monitored the jungle gym better. Today, my 3 yr old was trampled by about 7 children in the tunnel right above the check in/prize counter. One right after the other. He would try to get up and the next one would trample right on top of him. I saw the entire scenario go down and had to yell “WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!” Thankfully one of the older children in the jungle gym nearby heard me and pulled him to safety. She had to physically pull him out from under the other kids. He was crying and screaming. He could have been very seriously injured. The young lady working behind the counter saw the entire thing as well, and said not one word. During our time there today,  an employee came over the speaker system to tell kids not to climb up the slide on multiple occasions, and made reminders about wearing socks. If they can see that a child doesn’t have socks on and that children are climbing up the slide, they also have the ability to monitor rough play. I understand that sometimes situations like this just aren’t preventable, and kids will be kids. I’m not sure if it’s possible, but it would not be a bad idea for staff to be positioned throughout the jungle gym for an extra set of eyes to prevent issues like today. I know that waivers are required for each kid, but if the wrong family with the right connections and resources has a child that gets trampled, Kid Mania may find themselves liable after all. My nephew was injured at this location a few years back for the same reason.\n\nIf you have small children, I would recommend Cheeky Monkeys or Adventure Kids Playcare. There is a section for children 3 and under at this location, but there are always children in that section that are absolutely over the age of 3, and they’re never made to leave the section. If I had not seen the situation go down today and yelled, my child could have been really hurt. If you absolutely must go here and you have a child under the age of about 5, I would recommend you enter the jungle gym with them, or make sure they’re accompanied by an older sibling or friend. The jungle gym is simply too big and as a parent, you cannot get to them fast enough in an emergency."

Not only do they set up the room and break it down, but depending upon your theme, they may add decor to enhance your party room. They made his birthday seamless, and everyone was extremely helpful. The only thing I disliked was I only had my party room for an hour, but thankfully, we had our assigned party table for the duration of our stay. Thank you, Kid Mania team!"

Front 2/3 of space is a play area, with indoor slide, padded infant space, and store fronts (fire station, kitchen, grocery store, lawn to mow, and construction area. All spaces include sturdy but fun toys, sometimes including dress-up pieces. The back 1/3 is the cafe area with tables and chairs, display cases, etc.\n\nSeems like an ideal space for a play date, and a good retreat from the weather. Seemed oriented towards 0-5 age range.  It's very exciting to see a space like this in Stillwater! It's one of the very few indoor toddler spaces in town."

I think the pricing doesn't quite match the facility at the moment when compared to locations like Play On Main. I'm eager to see what changes will be made as they approach their grand opening!"

I also appreciated the separate baby area, which allows little ones to play safely on the floor.\nOverall, I highly recommend Play Ok for anyone with young children.

I brought my 7 kids and paid for the bottom 5 since they were under 10 which I appreciated given that my teens weren’t interested in playing. The owner was very sweet, patient, and laid back which helped everyone to relax and enjoy. The vignettes were so adorable that I wanted to play, especially in the bakery! Tons of space to play, spacious area to eat a snack and socialize with some adults, and so far, this has been my favorite children play place out of 3 I’ve visited."

The kids took all the toys from each room and put it in one room so my kids had nothing to play with. They normally cry when it’s time to go and this time they were asking to leave. I kinda wish the employees would walk around every once in awhile to prevent this. Especially when parents sit there and allow their kids to act like that."

The gentlemen working the front desk on 5/26/25 were wonderful, spoke to the kids with respect about the rules of the establishment. Sorry for making a mess with the Capri suns and the water! We will for sure be back!"

My children were able to play the arcade games, play on the indoor structures and play on the rock climbing wall which they really liked! We did not purchase any food or drinks however they did have a variety of snacks for purchase and Pizza if you wanted something hot. The facility was clean and cool, with seats for parents located in the middle of the structures so that you can easily see your child. Great place for getting all of the wiggles out of energetic littles! Reminds me of a place that was around when I was a child in the 90's called \"Discovery Zone\"."

I believe this location is new; it was certainly new to us and I’m so glad they are here because we need more indoor play places near Columbus. Funtastic is an indoor play place good for ages 1 (infant crawlers and even new walkers) through 12 and has areas sectioned off according to age. One of the selling points for us is how open the play area is so you can almost easily spot out your kids no matter where you were seated (another win, some places we have been to don’t have the kind of set up to easily supervise your kids). We just happened to not only be there at opening time but at a good time where there wasn’t too many kids there to play so space to play/run around was good. The facility was clean (this includes even the restroom) AND well lit so another win. Again we were there shortly after the play area was open for the day but we saw staff actively clean/sanitize when they could. Towards the end of the time (90 minute play time per play pass) we were reminded we could also extend our time if need be which is enforced based on the color wristband we were given at the beginning. I had to point out to the staff (who were not only helpful, they were polite and professional) I really appreciate that system. We will certainly be back when we are in the area."

They provide a link to send with the invites. As people register and complete the waiver, you get an email with an updated guest list. The party planner called and emailed several times to answer my questions and offer assistance. It is a little more expensive than some of our other options, but pizza and drinks are included so it works out to be better and easier."

Was promised the full party room and upon arrival only had half the room due to a “leak” from the previous time it rained. Was never told anything until I had to ask the worker on duty. Worker laughed on the phone when asking her boss about the room, when I was upset about the situation.\nDoors were all locked so bringing stuff in to decorate in the POURING rain through the front door was not fun. Unorganized and lack of communication. This is a new business but please work out your kinks especially in the party agreement."

They have a separate room for parties, they provide tables and chairs which is a plus! Everything is always so clean and tidy. It’s such a safe environment for kids of all ages! There are swings, a trampoline, zip-line (my girl’s favorite) an arts and craft room and so much more. You can tell they pour their hearts into the gym and the friends who come to play! 💗 thank you guys!!!!"

As of 10/11/2024 it's 250 for two hours, 15 kids, if any kids are added it's a additional 5 dollars per child. You can arrive 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after to clean up party room.       Cons. I asked the owner if she could turn on the music, she told me it was already on, which I believe her, but it was so low, that even she had stop breathing to hear it. I didn't push the issue, but she could have turned up at least one or notches, I feel like that made the atmosphere feel dry. Then towards the end. I'm not forsure if she was just over the party or what, but she definitely reminded me that it's the last 30 minutes and I should have my GUEST start cleaning the play area before we go back to the party room. I have never been to place, that asks you to do that, Mind you most of the party was littles. That is wasting the time that I paid for, I would have happily picked up after but, definitely not during. My guest or there parents shouldn't have to worry about that. I chose not to make my guest clean up and I told everyone to go back to the party room. That gave us guest enough time for cake, pizza, and presents. The party ended right on time giving us the 30 minutes allotted for the clean up. My older kids and the few stranglers at the end would have cleaned, but her and her husband already cleaned up the play area. All in all, it is a fun place for the kids to burn off the extra energy, my son absolutely loved the place. He did not want to leave. He has no complaints.}"

This makes it ideal for my kids who can get very overwhelmed if a place is super busy.\n\nThere is a smaller area for the little kids and there are well priced snacks!\nRestrooms are also very clean and the staff are wonderful!\n\nSuch an amazing play place!

I’ve never walked in and smelled any funky smells or seen it dirty, so cleanliness here is top notch. The playground is lots of fun for the littles, and staff is friendly as well which is pleasant. But I do have one big complaint, and that is that when purchasing tickets, I have to pay a full price ticket when all I am doing there is sitting and watching my kids play. They use to only charge ticket entry if you planned on also getting in on the fun of the playground with your kids, which sometimes I would happily do and have no problem. But there are times when I don’t, and I’m just there to watch my kids have fun, and they now require that regardless, you have to pay. I am super pregnant, I will not be doing anything but sitting in my bottom and watch my kids , I don’t think it’s fair to have to pay for that. Honestly it makes it really hard to afford taking my 4 kids when I also have to pay for myself and my husband to just sit there. It’s the main reason I haven’t been back for a long time, the price isn’t worth it sometimes as a one income household, which is a bummer bc besides that it’s a good place to take your kiddos."

Every time. Do we continue to go? Yes 🤣 it’s such a fun place. I’m just not sure if they are ever sanitizing anything 🤷🏼‍♀️ also, I think it’s more expensive than it should be.

Couldn’t enjoy the toddler section with my little because kids 7-10 were in there controlling all the toys and pushing babies out of the way. My older one couldn’t enjoy the big kid section because soooo many adults were playing?? Sliding, jumping on trampoline, climbing through the jungle gyms. It was a hot mess. My daughter was trying to jump on trampoline but there were 5 adults on it jumping and she couldn’t even stand back up. It was our first time there and it was terrible. Disappointed because I’ve heard such great things!"

As I ran to my child she continued to be on top of him. I had to push her off of him for her to realize she was hurting him. Then someone in her group attempted to argue with me about how they didn't know they weren't allowed on the trampoline with small children around. This place is poorly managed and the adults attending this location will body slam your child on the trampoline and not care. We attempted to tell the girls at the front desk who looked oblivious on what to do. We left and called to speak with a manager ... Ended up getting someone else who told us she was working in the kitchen and had no idea what had happened. The adults were not asked to get away from that area or asked to leave. I'm ashamed I ever thought this place was a good idea and I'm lucky we aren't in the emergency room right now. This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen and should be shut down for poor management."

Much smaller than other play places and comparatively overpriced for very limited features. their website said they're open till 4 on Saturday but when we showed up at 12 the lady working there said they're closing at 1 and still charged full price. she could have atleast offered a discount for closing early seeing as the only other people there were her kid and her family members. she also tried to charge for socks without asking until I asked about it. they charge a $5 fee per adult (not sure why they charge for our presence) and there is not really any seating for adults to sit other than a couple very small benches. the area is cute but for what they charge I wish they offered more for kids and parents who are waiting."

I think the business just needs to make sure their employees are all on the same page regarding events. Thanks for a fun time, Mon Ami!"

Can’t complaint at all, if you are looking for a safe place for your kids to play without you having to worry about the fact that they can get hurt if they fall or anything like that, this is the place, everything from the floors to the toys itself are designed to keep your baby safe, staff is friendly, place is clean and has a lot of options for the little ones to play with, only thing, we made a reservation and the same day off the party 20 minutes before we were told that kids need to have non slip socks and adults same or shoes covers, witch I do understand that is designed to keep the floor clean and everyone safe, but no one told us that until 20 minutes before, so we had to decide quick and ended up paying the place $1 for each parent shoes covers and $2 for each kids pairs of non slip socks, if they can comunícate better and tell you this before so you can make arrangement and shop for options will be better than just tell you right there 20 minutes before party stars, so keep that in mind and shop for this items, besides that, everything was great"

They have new toys to play with each visit, lots of fun activities and events, you can come play and then come back later for an event (that’s so unique compared to other places!!!) the toddler sized tables for them to eat snacks and lunch is such a plus. They even have complimentary coffee and comfy chairs. It’s one big room so I can actually relax and see my child no matter what she is playing with, no chasing around, no dodging bigger kids, just small children playing in a peaceful, clean space. Literally the best. There’s no place like Mon Ami, OKC needed this ❤️"

Over the past few years, we’ve supported this local business, spending quite a bit. Earlier this year, we hosted a birthday party at their Broken Arrow location, and we frequently purchase toys from their shop. It’s a lovely place to play, always clean and well cared for, with typically friendly staff.\n\nOur son is neurodivergent and can sometimes be loud or energetic. My husband and I fully understand this, and we are doing our best to parent him with care, encouraging him to be gentler and quieter while respecting his creativity and happiness. I watch him closely and correct him as needed. Today, he was being a bit loud and unreserved, but I felt he was creatively engaged, so I was observing to see if he would self-regulate.\n\nOne of the co-owners was also watching him, and it was clear she was not pleased. I understand there are rules and expectations, and we’re always willing to follow them. However, had she spoken to me with compassion or redirected his play respectfully—without a disparaging look or comment under her breath—I wouldn’t be writing this review.\n\nAgain, I acknowledge that my child can be a bit much, and we’re very mindful of the rules and of caring for the space. We truly needed just a little understanding today. For families with neurotypical children, this is a wonderful place to play. However, if your child is neurodivergent, be prepared for a possible lack of understanding and some judgment."

I was made aware by my 8-year-old that a grown woman, maybe in her late 60s,  yelled at her, asking her to get out of the ninja course because it was her grandchildren's turn. All while she was walking out of the ninja course. Unfortunately, my daughter notified me on our way home because the women scared her, and she was afraid to tell me when we were there.*** FYI all this happened while I was sitting at the chair area wish I would have been made aware of while we were there to notify staff then***.                                          I turned back to inform the employees, and I ran into this woman in the parking lot and politely questioned her. She started yelling at me, saying she was being “stern.”I'm sorry, but that woman had no right to yell or be stern with children who are not hers. If my children were at fault, the staff should have been notified. Unfortunately, after the incident, I was told the staff could not do anything since my child did not make them aware of the incident when it happened. To the women that felt comfortable yelling “Get Out!” To an 8-year-old in a kids' indoor park while they were playing, I’m sorry your heart is broken!"

However the price is rather steep in comparison to other larger indoor parks, and the price does not change despite how close to closing it is when you arrive. $14 per kid for all day, or $14 per kid for an hour.\nThe food option are limited and also quite steep in comparison. But with no arcade in sure they need to make up the income somewhere.\n\nVery friendly staff, and always changing it up to keep the toys fresh and interesting.\nBathrooms..... Issue!!

It’s by far the best toddler friendly indoor playground in okc.\nWhile I appreciate the effort to bring new things in, the new ninja area makes it difficult for us to continue supporting the business\n\nOur 3 year non verbal doesn’t understand why he has to wait his turn and can only be in the area for a short time in order to let the other kiddos have their turn which results in big melt downs due to his neurodivergence.\nBringing in something new, tailored to older kids with lots of rules makes playbox a lot less toddler friendly than before, which made it so special.\n\nStill giving 5 stars because the place and the team have always been amazing! Just really sad we can no longer enjoy it\n\nWe are hoping to be back as regulars when our little is out of the toddler phase in a few years and can hopefully understand and follow the rules"

My boys were hungry but I couldn't bring myself to buy them chocolate and soda. Some healthier options should be presented. 2) price. $14/kid was a bit steep but I'd be willing to return so maybe they're priced fairly"

The first time we had nothing but good things to say, but after this last party we left feeling very dissapointed at the way we were treated. We very much felt like inferior guests and undervalued customers. When we arrived for our kids party there was a sign on the door saying they were closing early for a private party. Well…part of the draw to this facility is that after your allotted party time, your guests can stay and play as long as they want. Instead we were rushed out. When talking to the manager she claimed that she called us, yet neither my husband nor I have any calls or voicemails from the playbox. She offered to give us a couple passes for free play, but we felt this warranted bigger measures as this was our child’s birthday that was cut short unknowingly to us who paid a lot of money for our guests to continue to stay and play. 2 free play passes does nothing, how about making it right? It was embarrassing, even our guests were upset. It takes a lot for us to complain and I understand mistakes happen but there was no compassion or understanding for our frustrations from the staff, only a lack of accountability. In the future, if private parties are booked and there are previously booked parties shortly before, the staff should confirm with the surrounding parties and if people are unhappy, then they should be allowed to back out of their reservation and book their child’s special day at a facility that will be equally accommodating. Please keep in mind before booking your kids special day here, that their day can be cut short without your knowledge in order to accommodate a private party who will provide more money to the business."

YOU get in FREE and can stay as long as you like! There  are even unlimited plans. My daughter is 7, and absolutely loves to come here. She will even do chores just to earn another visit. She has become so comfortable with the staff, mainly the manager Fashion, she now attends Parents Night Out, which is held periodically and is from 530 to 830pm. Fashion is amazing and we love seeing her smiling face! Parents nnight out is perfect for a little \"parent time\". Cannot recommend this place more!! Too hot? Too cold? Too stormy?.... GO TO THE PLAYBOX! You won't regret the visit! I highly recommend the blue slide, even for the adults!"

This one in Mustang has a center section that kids can run through, but it is small, and is only 2 levels. It is short, so adults can't really go through it with the children. Around the center structure are other play areas. There is a fire station with nothing in it. There is a school room with nothing in it. By nothing, I mean 3 walls, and nothing even on the walls. There is a market with a few groceries, 2 carts, a cash register, and, inexplicably, a toy oven. There are no pots and pans or cooking utensils. There is a section in the back with toys for little ones. There is a food truck that has no play food or drinks or anything else that came with it out of the box. There is another kitchen with no items to play with it. It makes no sense. Why have these things? They just made my grandchildren wander around, looking for the missing ingredient to this place, which is fun. There is an awful lot of fun missing. We won't be back."

It also has a large carpeted area around the outside of the main playground equipment to play if it’s too busy. It also has a great toddler area for your little ones and play shops (Firehouse, School, and Market).\n\n- Good Location. Didn’t feel unsafe when arriving or leaving.\n\nI highly recommend you try this place out next time you’re looking for an indoor play place.\n\nSide note: I was only able to get a photo of one side of the equipment. I wasn’t able to get photos of the rest of the area since other children were playing there."

They do all of the work for it and the kids absolutely had a blast.\n\nThey also have a whole area with tables which was perfect for our decorate your own cupcakes we had.

I love that neurotypical and neurodivergent kiddos alike can enjoy all the sensory play options. When my oldest suggested that we host our 5 year olds birthday here, I was all for it! They make party planning so easy! The decorations, utensils/plates/napkins, beautiful cake, juices, and pizza were all included in the party package we booked. We did a morning party so decided to cater Chick-Fil-A breakfast instead (super easy since CFA is in the parking lot). The owner is the loveliest and kindest human. We’ve told all of our friends to book their parties here too!"

It made it really nice to just let the kids go and play without wondering where they were at all time. We had plenty of time to set up and take everything down. The pretend play area was a huge hit! I also really appreciated the prompt replies to my emails  whenever I had a question.\n\nI do have a couple of suggestions: 1) Consider having a bucket for toys that get dirty. We had little ones that like to put things in their mouth. We weren't really sure where to put those toys because we didn't just want to leave them. If I missed where the bucket it is then please disregard this suggestions! 2) Maybe clean up the wall where the birthday banners typically go in the party room. We didn't have a big banner, and we had to do our best to cover up the holes and chipped paint. There was a lot of left over tape on the walls, and it just didn't look that nice.\n\nNone of this takes away from the experience, which is why I still want to give it 5 stars. I would definitely have a party here again!"

There are swings, balls, tunnels, steps, a trampoline, climbing wall, sensory slide, and other sensory exploration items.    They also have a calming room if someone is overstimulated and needs to have some me time.   In the back there are regular toys and other imaginary play items, like kids kitchen and deli. Also they have a table for trains and one for magnets.  I'm sure I'm missing something.   I did notice they offer other services, but I was there for open free play."

The kids had fun and I believe you guys are doing a great job at serving the kiddo community with disabilities however the gym was just not clean. The blue foam tiles were clearly dingy and dirty, I even noticed that there was crushed up Cheetos under the foam arch slide. The sock rule is not enforced. Half of the kids had socks on half didn’t. The foam floor really needs to be cleaned and sanitized or replaced and start fresh. The stairs to the slide and zip line were really dirty too.\n\nI’m used to our gym when it’s busy the workers coming through doing some pickup/sanitizing. Some of the toys looked dingy/dirty. I didn’t notice a “germ worm” anywhere to put mouthed toy items in to make sure other kids don’t play with them.  The calming corner was extremely crammed with items making it so really only one kid could fit in at a time to calm down. The pretend play section was wrecked 2 hours in from opening. I did pick up after my kids, but obviously not all parents do.\n\nI also felt there was too much things in the gym area, that it made it almost hard to walk through. I kept trying to move the balls and put up the different foam pieces to make room but there was just a lot in a tiny area. The swings are a bit close together and the walkway is pretty nonexistent so I actually got hit by a kid swinging.\n\nThe kids did have fun but I’m just used to the cleanliness and space of our old we rock the spectrum."

Having a toddler and a child on the spectrum makes it stressful going to playplaces just the 3 of us, but at We Rock I can actually relax because I know they're both safe and having fun. I can also keep an eye on both of them no matter where they're at in the gym. We've had a couple of birthday parties here in the past for my oldest and plan to use them again for my toddler's upcoming birthday. I love that it's always private for no extra charge. The gym is always clean and Gwen is constantly adding to the gym by bringing in new toys/sensory equipment, adding classes, etc. Cannot say enough good things about We Rock. We love it here! 💗"

It is her favorite place in the community to go and she would happily live there if it were possible!\nNot only are the owners the kindest people you will ever meet in your life, they go beyond out of their way to make the gym as inclusive of a place as possible. My daughter is blind and the owner is always asking how she can improve or change things to be more accessible to her. They have a non profit and never, I mean never stop working to better the lives of all children. They are always connecting families with support, resources, and offering respite care for parents to get a break when they themselves never get a break (and are so very deserving of one).\nThere are toys and supplies located all over the gym because it is a place for children to PLAY and use their imagination, learn, grow and develop. If you are looking for a sad beige aesthetic with no creativity or color, then this will not be the place for you. If you are looking for a place for your children to feel free to be themselves, use their creative brain while having sensory stimulation.... have a moment of peace of mind for yourself, potentially make close friends who understand your struggles and celebrate your successes as a parent, and have lots of fun in a colorful, thriving environment, then please come hang out with us! If you come after a large crowd has just left and you're unsatisfied...I encourage you to offer to help clean up. Everyone deserves some help sometimes. You don't know the kind of day they may be having or how much they would appreciate it. In the time it takes to write a negative review you could do something about your complaint. Kindness and compassion go a long way in making the world a better place."

We booked the place after hearing and reading how all ages could have fun here and our son is barely learning to walk. I also really appreciated the private aspect of the birthday rental. My son gets overstimulated with too many people. It was PERFECT!!! It had a small play area built like a shopping/pretend play area for little ones 1-5. All of the kids at the party hardly cared for the pizza and desserts because they couldn't stop playing. It was full of toys and play equipment suited for everyone. I don't think they knew where to start. I only wish she wasn't so booked, or else we would have paid for another hour. All the moms loved it and wanted to know about the booking info for their little ones. I HIGHLY recommend this facility! We will definitely be back again during regular business hours and most likely for his next birthday."

Everything was clean and I felt totally comfortable letting our toddler run around and play. What sets this place apart from others is that it’s mostly geared towards younger ages (I would say 6 and under). All around I highly recommend!"

We were able to rent the entire place and the decor is absolutely beautiful, cute, posh, and kid friendly. It was just wonderful to have alerting taken care of for you. We purchased the package that included cupcakes and the Dino that comes out to dance. I was also impressed with how organized it was and there were different play areas each with its own play theme. My daughter loved the little kitchen area and some of our little guests enjoyed wearing the costumes that were set up in the back. Jill helped us coordinate our party and was just absolutely kind and walked me through everything. They did let us bring our own cake and food. Some of the parents went next door to get some coffee because with that many kids running around, you need to keep up. That in itself was convenient for the adults. The goody bags that were provided had some fun quality toys in there. We appreciated the nice personal touches like the slide show photos of our daughter and the little sign with her picture on it was so sweet. Dino Kidz really went that extra mile.This is the Allen location. I would’ve chosen the one in Carrollton, but most of our guests live closer to Allen. We can’t wait to visit the Carrollton location soon."

They even do a dance party every couple hours where they turn down the lights and play dance videos, then have a bubble party. The facilities are clean and the staff is kind, and there's soft padding over the flooring so it's a good place for babies and toddlers too. It's a great place to meet up with friends for play dates too!"

          "content": "We have been coming here since they opened and have always loved it. Today we celebrated my daughter’s first birthday here and I literally can’t even put into words to explain my gratitude and happiness for this place. First of all let’s talk about cleanliness and space, this is hands the cleanest play place in all of DFW. Everything always looks so immaculate  every time we come in. You can tell they care a lot about the health of children with how clean they keep it. They’re always adding new things, the space is open, and there is so much to do for all ages, from a babies to 9 year olds. Second, price point, which for me is huge. So many play places now a days don’t have many budget friendly options. Dino kidz has that still while having the cutest special customizing that’s included in your package which just made our party feel so elevated! Like the slideshow of pictures of our daughter and the sign out front. Lastly, Jill and the girls are actual angels from heaven and decorated everything so beautifully. They were helpful, kind, informative, and loving to us and all of guests. Anyone who disagrees with that, must have a mental illness. I literally couldn't have gotten through the day without these ladies. Jill is also so good with the kids, she came and sat on the ground and played with my daughter and I for a minute, and my daughter tried to hold on to her which she doesn’t do to most people! They explain the rules about the keeping the door shut and yucky bins and that’s it! Normal rules about not carrying toys when climbing, which thank goodness for that right? We have some wild brothers and older kids in our party, no one broke the rules, no one got yelled at, kids were able to be kids! I love the music and activities they have planned and the schedule for their parties, it keeps the kids interested and no one is sitting around bored. The good-bye bubble party at the end is the best idea. The pictures I took don't even do it justice. I would have my kids party over and over again at Dino Kidz! We thank you guys for giving us the best party for our baby girl. We will never forget it. If you’re looking to plan a party here, I wouldn’t think twice! 10/10"

I brought my kid here to avoid screen time at home, not to have her see it on an even bigger screen. Also the music is blasting the entire time so it all just felt really overstimulating"

The themed decorations were nice but could have been a lot better.\n2. The pizza was cold after sitting too long.\n3. The staff was friendly but didn’t know much about what my party consists of. We had a themed character, a balloonist, & a face painter. The host was not aware until she looked it up.\n4. They only clean 15 minutes before the next party\nThey leave previous party balloons out even when they don’t match current theme.\n5. Need newer play equipment\n6. Behind the counter is chaotic clutter\n7. Vegetable & Fruit Platter should have been a better presentation. I can get better from Kroger.\n8. Buy your own cupcakes, the ones provided were just ok.\n9. For $1700, I expected a lot more from Dino Kidz not the 3rd party vendors.\n\nThe PROS:\n1. You get the place just for your party\n2. 3rd party vendors really know how to hype a party, the balloonist was exceptional. The face painter was also wonderful.\n3. The staff was friendly & good at hosting\n4. They set-up & clean up\n5. The dance party was great\n6. The slideshow was a very special touch\n\nOverall, because of the balloonist & the themed character we were able to hype the party & make a really nice time. The kids of course loved it & that’s what mattered."

I told her it was our first time here and she immediately helped me with getting familiar with the place. I have been to many play gyms and I must say this one is the best one and it was so worth the drive. Please give Jill a raise she is doing an amazing job here with the kiddos!"

I always worry  about there being too many people for my baby or an over whelming environment for her, but the fact that we had the entire place to ourselves put my mind at such ease. They do all the work like decorating and cleaning and everything in between. So I was over the moon to be able to actually be with my birthday girl and play and celebrate without any stress. They were so caring and informative, and always had a smile. If I could give them 10 stars I would. We will be coming back for my oldest daughters 7th birthday. She had so much fun and can't wait to be back! See you soon Dino Kidz!"

We booked the “In-Between” party package and was so relieved to leave my house with only decorations and cake. Victoria & Dalton provided pizza, drinks, and ice cream which took a whole load off of my plate in party planning. She also did the baloon arch and had the best ideas for decorating. This was an easy experience and worth every penny. All of the kids had a plastic and the parents of the birthday boy loved doing minimal clean up.\n\nThank you again for the best birthday party experience! I highly recommend Mini Muskogee whether it’s to plan a party, a field trip, visit an event they host, or just open play!"

It even has space so our babies, who need to run, can just RUN! I’ve been to a lot of wonderful indoor play spaces, but this one offers an amazing collaboration of large motor sensory tasks such as swinging, climbing, and jumping to quieter pretend play areas and calming rooms for kids who can get overwhelmed by noise, movement, and busy activity. The parents who accompany their kiddos are ENGAGED and PRESENT to support, not only their own babies but those of the We Rock the Spectrum community.  The McGregors LOVE We Rock the Spectrum!!"

The changing table is everything a momma could ask for when changing her little. We will absolutely be going back!"

Worker laughed on the phone when asking her boss about the room, when I was upset about the situation.\nDoors were all locked so bringing stuff in to decorate in the POURING rain through the front door was not fun. Unorganized and lack of communication. This is a new business but please work out your kinks especially in the party agreement."

As of 10/11/2024 it's 250 for two hours, 15 kids, if any kids are added it's a additional 5 dollars per child. You can arrive 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after to clean up party room.       Cons. I asked the owner if she could turn on the music, she told me it was already on, which I believe her, but it was so low, that even she had stop breathing to hear it. I didn't push the issue, but she could have turned up at least one or notches, I feel like that made the atmosphere feel dry. Then towards the end. I'm not forsure if she was just over the party or what, but she definitely reminded me that it's the last 30 minutes and I should have my GUEST start cleaning the play area before we go back to the party room. I have never been to place, that asks you to do that, Mind you most of the party was littles. That is wasting the time that I paid for, I would have happily picked up after but, definitely not during. My guest or there parents shouldn't have to worry about that. I chose not to make my guest clean up and I told everyone to go back to the party room. That gave us guest enough time for cake, pizza, and presents. The party ended right on time giving us the 30 minutes allotted for the clean up. My older kids and the few stranglers at the end would have cleaned, but her and her husband already cleaned up the play area. All in all, it is a fun place for the kids to burn off the extra energy, my son absolutely loved the place. He did not want to leave. He has no complaints.}"

From set-up to clean-up, everything was completely taken care of, making the day entirely stress-free for us.\n\nThanks to Jungle Castle and Corey, our child’s 1st birthday wasn’t just a party — it was a truly special celebration that we’ll always remember. We are so grateful and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to create an unforgettable event!"

When entering with my children, I was told by the owner that I would not be allowed to enter the party area because of my “situation”-meaning I’m a wheelchair user.   He stated that when it came time to sing happy birthday, he’d have the group come to the front area.   He stated that my wheelchair posed a danger to the children in the play area.  My manual wheelchair was a concern for him due to liability and  the possibility of children running into me.  I explained that the room was about 8 feet away.   He suggested I could possibly enter through the back door. I then suggested I would be willing to crawl to the area if it made him more comfortable.  He declined with an eye roll.\n\nI suggested that he could escort me to the party room if it made him feel more comfortable but I would not be uprooting an entire party because he was, in my opinion, displaying discriminatory practices due to not understanding how individuals use their mobility devices and most of the children in the facility knew me.\n\nNeedless to say he made a huge production of “clearing a path” for me to be escorted into the party room.  And did It again when it was time for me to leave.  I was told that I was NOT allowed to leave the party room.  I was unable to watch my children play.   My youngest got hurt in the equipment  (shockingly not by my wheelchair) and  she had to come to the party room (where I was) for assistance.\n\nThis is not equal access.  This was not treating anyone with dignity.  He stated flatly that he was being reasonable and trying to protect the children.  I assure you, I’m not large.  I’m not quick.  And I work with children daily.  I am not a danger to children.\n\nThis was a humiliating experience.  I will never go back again.   If you are a wheelchair user, please know…you will not be allowed into the play area without him escorting you and thats only to a designated area only.    I’m not even sure if children with mobility devices will be allowed into the facilities.\n\nSuch a shame.  It was an adorable facility."

You might as well put a sign on the door that says “Disabled not welcome”. You can’t treat people as if they aren’t welcome because you are ignorant to their abilities. You also don’t need to clear a path for people in a wheelchair and make a big production about it. They get around fine all day without people clearing the way for them.

From the moment I booked a few weeks in advance, Corey, the owner, was incredibly helpful and professional, making the entire process smooth and stress-free.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most was that booking a party reserves the entire facility exclusively for your private event—no worrying about overcrowding or unexpected guests. I also loved that Jungle Castle updates their Google hours to show \"Closed\" during private parties to prevent the public from walking in for free play. That level of organization and respect for private events is something you don’t see everywhere!\n\nWhen I sent my birthday theme, I was amazed at how perfectly they decorated everything down to the last detail! They even provided a beautiful cake stand, making it so much easier for me. I didn’t have to stress about decorating or ordering anything other than our cake, which was a huge relief!\n\nOur main hostess, Teagan, was phenomenal! She was not only attentive and professional, but I could tell she genuinely loves kids and what she does. She made me feel supported and heard throughout the entire party, ensuring everything ran smoothly and that my little one was having the best time.\n\nSince my son is still so small, having a safe, age-appropriate play space was incredibly important to me. The setup at Jungle Castle is perfect for little ones—no worrying about bigger kids running over him or unsafe play areas. It gave me such peace of mind knowing he could explore and play freely without any risks.\n\nOverall, Jungle Castle exceeded my expectations in every way! Whether you’re looking for a fun place for free play or planning a private event, I HIGHLY recommend them! We will definitely be back! 💙🎉🎂"

The biggest perk to us though was getting the entire facility to ourselves for the entire party. They were wonderful hosts and more affordable than other venues we looked at. We highly recommend having your kids party here! Definitely doing a future party here for my other kids! Corey (the owner) is seriously so nice too so bonus points for that.

It was amazing to show up, day-of and have decor, food, drinks and activities all set up!! This place is great for little kids, as it has padded flooring for the crawlers, yet also has a big climbing structure with slides  and a trampoline for the bigger kids!! We had a party of over 20 kids and got so many compliments on the amazing party!! Staff was great and helpful- very kind and great w kids!! Would do this again!!! Highly recommend- Corey, the owner, was also a great communicator and accommodated us well!!"

The new owner, Cory, is incredibly kind and welcoming—our kids always want to say hi to Mr. Cory. It’s a wonderful small business, not a big corporate chain, and you can really feel the personal touch. We can’t wait to plan their next birthday party here!! Highly recommend!"

They have baby wipes in the play area (if you have a toddler, you know how important this is lol). I checked around to so many places and this place BY FAR had the best customer service and deal on a birthday party for my 2 year old. We got everything we needed in our package, which also included the room being fully decorated before we arrived. We had such an amazing time! It’s literally the perfect play place for small children. I can’t wait to go back!"

There were bubbles and music, and my wife and I were so happy that our son and all of his little friends had such a great time. In fact, several children were refusing to leave when it was time for their parents to collect them. 🤣 A well deserved five stars for the environment, safety, management, and cleanliness. Thank you Cory and all the employees who helped make my son’s birthday a home run."

We go there a lot, and each time, she makes new friends. She loves for me to count how long it takes her to go down the slide from going through the play place. I prefers Jungle Castle to other play places because it has a calmer vibe to it, and I know where my daughter is at all times. It’s good for babies to big kids. For her 6th birthday, she had to have her party here, and we are so excited because you get the whole place to yourself, not just a party room."

We booked the “In-Between” party package and was so relieved to leave my house with only decorations and cake. Victoria & Dalton provided pizza, drinks, and ice cream which took a whole load off of my plate in party planning. She also did the baloon arch and had the best ideas for decorating. This was an easy experience and worth every penny. All of the kids had a plastic and the parents of the birthday boy loved doing minimal clean up.\n\nThank you again for the best birthday party experience! I highly recommend Mini Muskogee whether it’s to plan a party, a field trip, visit an event they host, or just open play!"

It's a great inexpensive way to get the kids out of the heat for a couple hours and for parents to get a chance to relax! She also has party packages available and events often with characters that kids love! If I could give more than 5 stars I absolutely would!!"

A worker was there and helpful the entire time. The thirty minutes setup time is a little stressful so be prepared I thought I was and still needed more time, but im also new to party throwing. There’s not a lot of room for the adults so keep that in mind! All in all it was a success and worth it. My daughter turned two and she had a blast!"

Another huge plus-- if you visit it early, your entrance fee is good the ENTIRE Day, so weve gone early and then left to eat, run errands etc and come back later in the day for another hr or so!

Very narrow area to walk around and kids keep running in to each other in every play area, not a desirable thing especially with all kinds of flus making rounds. They need serious expansion of their play space."

Here’s why I give Little Lions Den 5 Stars!\n*CLEAN: the owner also uses non-toxic cleaning supplies\n*SAFE: everything is age appropriate and good for ages 0-5. This means that I don’t have to worry (too much) about big kids crushing mine. The owner makes sure all kids are being safe while playing too!\n*GREAT SIZE: large enough for there to be lots of things for my kids to do and never get bored. It’s also small enough that I can see them everywhere no matter where I’m at.\n*LOCAL/FAMILY OWNED: the owner is SO SWEET! She’s a former educator, so she is intentional about her space being fun AND educational. Her kids are fantastic and so sweet to my kids.\n*AFFORDABLE: $10 per kid and monthly memberships available too!\n*BIRTHDAY PARTIES: get the whole space, able to decorate, and bring your own food! Ridiculously affordable as well!\n*EVENTS: they’ve had several events like reading with Elsa and movement classes. We are excited about the Valentine’s Day brunch.\n*COFFEE: I’m pretty sure she’s adding coffee YALL WE NEED IT!"

Very successful party! No clean up fuss, was able to just get up and go when we were ready. Great experience."

The back 1/3 is the cafe area with tables and chairs, display cases, etc.\n\nSeems like an ideal space for a play date, and a good retreat from the weather. Seemed oriented towards 0-5 age range.

I know it’s new, so I’m hoping it stays that way. There was someone here (volunteering) when we got here, but she left shortly after. So there may not always be someone here. Other than that, it’s a great place. I’m happy that we can come here to get the wiggles out when it’s snowing and we can’t be outside. It’s a nice addition for Cheyenne kids to play.}"

We had a play date there and to 2yr olds and 4yr olds they were using the terms “timeout” “your going to be in trouble” although I use these terms myself I am the parent and not a stranger and a stranger should never say that to a child that isn’t theirs. Us parents were talking care of the “issues” each time. Also they need to have better barriers to keep kids from getting behind the inflatables. It was a very disappointing experience and truthfully never wants to go back again. My kids even said it wasn’t fun thanks to the staff member and they are 2 and 4 making this statement. That says something."

You can tell plenty of thought has gone into making everything as kid friendly as possible.\n\nNice change from the massive trampoline parks charging an arm and a leg for 90 minutes.

In fact they clean before each session! No funky smells (like the play places at fast food spots) and best part 100% affordable! $20 bucks for entry for our toddle, my father in law, (wife and I were free) and we bought two pairs of the socks! Such a great experience, we will def be back!"

The girls at the front desk explained the rules to us- as always, but kids will be kids…the front desk girls almost seemed annoyed at not just my kids but all the kids playing. Specifically my kids- no running, ok i get it but sometimes toddlers don’t understand so they don’t need to be told every time they make a mistake. My oldest was playing near the toddler section knowing he couldn’t get in because we were following the rules, and along comes front desk to tell him he can be there but can’t touch the blocks. At this point we’re already frustrated because it seems we are being monitored. We even overheard them talking out loud saying “I’m done telling them” . If you’re going to work at a place specifically for kids, please make it an enjoyable environment. I was also not the only parent annoyed at this time."

Let’s IMAGINE that employees of this business find joy in the pain of others when they just want their child to have a fun experience. Well, then you have came to the right place!

It makes me feel so good that she can have so much fun while I get a little bit done. My daughter looks forward to her time at Let's Imagine every week! Highly recommend getting a membership if you want to come weekly. Also a great place if you want to have coffee and a conversation with a friend while your kids play. Highly recommend all around!"

She made a lot of friends with kids mostly her age. She didn’t even sit down until everyone was leaving and I bought her some snacks.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and the two-hour rate is VERY reasonable.  The kids snacks are very inexpensive as well.  It is a safe and clean environment in which family can gather and play.  Also, a warm place to play on such a cold day.  It was great watching families play and have fun in such a great environment!  I give this place a 20 out of 10!  No exaggeration!"

You can stay here for hours. The concessions are ok and fairly reasonably priced. The equipment is next level and a real gem in the area. If you’re traveling through it’s a nice spot to take a couple of hairs detour through, but mainly I’ve seen that it’s more of a destination spot."

Worth EVERY mile. My kids range from 10 to 2 and my 4 y/o has profound autism, every one of them had a blast!! If your littles have any sensory issues the music might be just a tad loud but once you get into the play area all the foam (padding) muffles it down nicely. This place is truly for everyone, big kids, little kids, awkward in-between kids, special kids, and adults who are kids at heart ❤️. We will definitely be coming back (I wish tomorrow), and would not hesitate to recommend this place to EVERYONE. Best money I've spent this year. Thank you Kidvsille."

Love that the baby has her own area to play in but she can also climb most everywhere else in the gym. I was a little disappointed in the cleanliness with our last visit. I know it’s hard to keep a kid area clean! It’s need a really good vacuuming. There was a wall with broken pieces that wasn’t cleaned up either and it was definitely a choking hazard for littles. We still love this place though! We will be back. I hope the cleanliness improves though!\n\nAnd I hope the rules change on outside food. For those who have food allergies, they can’t eat there and you can’t leave the building to eat in your car and come back in."

This was completely unacceptable and the parent didn’t see this happen for some reason.

It did get extremely warm in there, you could tell the A/C wasn't on and my son was sweaty fir the majority of our time there. So even if it's cold outside dress the kiddies down once they are inside or they will over heat lol. They had a Little soccer/basketball area that was the highlight of the trip there. It seemed pretty clean but I didn't not see staff go around and wipe things down. I would've liked to have seen that. Kids were drooling, sticking their mouths on everything in there haha kids will be kids. Mad fun we will be back!"

I would love to leave more stars, but during our most recent visit we were told that our “day pass” we purchased was only good if we stayed in the parking lot. We had gone back to our relatives’ house to allow our 2 year old to nap. This policy was not communicated when we made our purchase, and even though we presented our receipt, we had to pay for two day passes for one child. This policy should be changed or it should be clearly communicated to everyone upon purchase."

Tons of snack and drink options that were very reasonably priced. Overall, a great experience. We’ll definitely be back!"

Of course, being younger there was a limited amount of activities he wasn’t scared of doing/could do, but he had a wonderful time nonetheless! It was also the perfect day to be able to go to an indoor playground since the weather was being funky.\n\nAlso want to add, there seemed to be an issue with one family there, but the two ladies who took care of the situation did so with grace and a lot of patience rather than the alternative. I’m not sure of the situation, but I know being in any kind of issue with a customer can be very stressful. Kudos to yall and I hope yall had a better afternoon. 🥺 We look forward to visiting again!"

As they are asking for reviews and get a tube of chapstick.\nIt’s an extremely bad area, drug deals going on outside, the play equipment is broken, doesn’t work, or missing parts, not to mention the horrible bathrooms. There are signs hanging up saying excuse the smell they’re working on it but you can tell they’ve been up awhile. This is a sad representation for the business as it’s not kept up or cleaned even with the franchise owner there.\n\nEdit to respond to owner:\nThe place speaks for itself and we visited there over a month ago so I hope the “pipe issues” has been resolved by now because the build up of methane in closed areas is dangerous along with the broken down equipment that’s to much to list."

          "content": "We had my baby's first birthday party at Playpalz.  This was the first time I have ever spent money on a \"venue\" for a party.  Will I do it again?  maybe, all places for kids parties are about the same in price. Value for the price is so so.  I spent close to 500 for Party Room B.  The room was a nice size to fit all my guests and super clean and ready for me to decorate.  The party came with 15 drinks for kids and 2 pizzas.  Great if you are just planning on feeding kids.  If you are wanting to feed the grownups too then you will need to purchase more pizza and drink packages... I understand the reasoning for no outside food or drinks but I also find it silly that I have to spend 40 dollars for 40 waters that I could easily buy at walmart for maybe way less.  It was a Saturday so that place was insanely crazy as you can imagine but all the kids had a great time.  You are only allotted 90 minutes for party set up/ take down and party time.  I feel like it was a little rushed, decorations were taken down I feel like almost right after putting them up.  I think people should get a full 2 hours.  I brought my own decor but made sure it was all put together at home so that when I brought it in all we had to do was tape to the wall.  Brings me to my next point.  We were not allowed to thumb tac anything and could only use tape they provided (which was NOT good tape).  My decorations kept falling, which was very frustrating.  I was given a party host Chelsea.  Chelsea was phenomenal!  She helped we bring decor to the room, helped me put decor up, helped decorate the highchair, kept the party moving smoothly, handed out pizza, helped with cake, helped clean up after my baby after his smash cake.  She was my right hand man and I couldn't have done the party without her.  Thank you Chelsea, well deserved included gratuity.   I love playpalz and will always return for a fun play day but as for a party place I feel like there are cheaper options out there that allow you to bring your own outside food and drink for a longer party time."

          "content": "To start, My child loved getting to play on the equipment they have and with their friends. They didn't want to leave at all, which is why I'm leaving 2 stars. I took off 3 stars because I did not see the value for the amount of money spent and I will explain why.\nFirst reason: they only include 20 slices of pizza and 15 drinks [what the girl on the phone to confirm my party add ons said, even though their website states 20 drinks are included] for up to 25 guests and those 25 guests, include adults. You may not bring any outside food or drink, which is fine, but the amount charged for the food they provide is high. I added on a fruit tray [that was $60] because I wanted the fruit available for the kids and from my child's party last year, that was about what I spent on fruit for my own fruit trays and I wouldn't have to wash and cut it... the fruit tray that was brought into the party room was in a store bought container and was less fruit than what I spent $60 on last year, plus the very large strawberries were whole. For a place that has all ages of children, I find it incredibly odd that they did not at least half, if not quarter the strawberries. The high food add ons, that you're pretty much forced into, also contribute into my ire on my third reason.\nSecond reason: I paid for a theme add on and for that $30, I got a themed happy birthday sign, a stack of themed plates, a stack of themed napkins, & about 5 themed tablecloths. I did not get to keep any of those supplies and you could clearly see labelled boxes under the tables for other themes. It was also clearly outlined, that plates, napkins, tablecloths, & utensils were already included in the base party price.... I'm super confused on why the add on stated \"come in to your party already decorated,\" when it was a sign and tablecloths and why the add on is $30.\nThird reason: we had a party host included in the base price that was for \"party set up, clean up, & to coordinate,\" that gets an automatic 5% gratuity added on to your final bill. I'm totally fine with the concept, but the execution was lacking. The host did the set up and clean up, but the only thing she did for \"coordinating,\" was ask when she should have the pizza in the room. For a tipped position with coordinating the party as part of the position, I expected the host to actually have a timeline and help us stick to the timeline within the 90min we had the room for. She was nowhere to be seen part of the time and the other part of the time she was just in a corner of the room watching people. Actually making sure your parties are happening on schedule is important... We were supposed to have 10min before the party in our party room. We arrived exactly 10min before, to find the party room was not actually ready and it was past our party start time before we got to go back to it. I highly suggest coaching your host staff on giving parties a heads up when there's 30min & 10min left and leaving more time in between parties to accomodate for any running a little over, clean up, and so incoming parties actually get their 10min before their guests start arriving to get settled in.\nFourth reason: Overall customer service... I ran out of room to fully elaborate, but there were multiple times I was asked about adding their add ons and multiple times I had questions that were not answered. There was no guidance on where to finish paying for the party and despite asking for a receipt as I checked out, I still had to go back for it. The woman that did complete my transaction, did ask how the party was and did ask for feedback on what could be better; I was just too overwhelmed and tired in the moment to answer her then.\nFifth reason: the bathrooms are in the no shoes area and my partner immediately left the mens room and went somewhere else to use the bathroom.\nSixth reason: Included in the base price is a t-shirt and FREE return pass for the birthday child... We did not receive a t-shirt or any kind of voucher nor did we receive information on how we can redeem the return pass.\nPlease train your staff better."

The nursing room is dingy and super depressing. The bins for shoes were beyond dirty and gross. The play space was decent but could use a good deep cleaning. Pros were it was an ok price for an indoor playground and the snacks were cheap. But I couldn’t get over the smell."

I just didn’t feel like in front of customers was appropriate. Mom didn’t really react to it like she was surprised (because when she said it she looked up and So oh that’s just my mom)  And that may just be their relationship.

A cop pointing a gun at a menacing perp handcuffed in a police car… I wish more thought was given into the decision to add these to the assortment of great play activities.

The entire staff is phenomenal and I feel like I got to enjoy my son’s birthday instead of making sure every little thing was taken care of. From serving food to cleaning up the room, the staff did it all! It may seem “expensive” but I did the math on a lot of places in town and it breaks down to a really great value. If you’re on the fence, do it! It’s the best party in town!!"

It’s so affordable and we love that LaLa Land resale joined in for the added shopping fun! If you haven’t been yet it should be next on your play place rotation!"

Get there and find the out. That was fine till i found out they turned away my disabled mother. Which should have been okay. My fruit tray i paid for had mold in the black berries.. to end up paying 530 for the rest of the party. I only seen my party host when she took us to the room. Never again seen her. She stay up front with her co worker or was carrying around a small baby. As far as the party. Its was a nice place for kids to play, they had a good time. I would not  have another party here. Way too over priced for what i got."

Prior to booking we were told that we would have a party host. Our host was very inattentive. She was in the room when we came in. She left out while we were in the process of handling our signs and putting treat bags out. She spent the remainder of our party time in the front desk area socializing with co workers.  My adult guess, my husband and I all had to “work.” I had to leave the party room to multiples to ask for things such as our drinks. We never mind to pay for and tip good service. I hope that you all will make improvements. I currently feel that we received false advertisement. Stop telling potential customers that parents can come in and relax as a selling pitch if that is not going to be a reality. Lastly, the mandatory tip that is added to the bill should be optional especially in situations like this. This is a great facility for kids unfortunately the customer service does need to be made a priority."

Stale cookies just sitting in cups they are selling.\nIt’s still not bad for the price but it needs maintenance and upkeep.\n\nIt used to be 5 stars- and they have promotions for if you give 5 stars you get chapstick, so that skews the rating.\nNow it’s 3 because it’s still mostly safe and reasonably priced."

There are constantly employees wiping the structure down, using a Swiffer to clean the floor, and rearranging the toddler space to keep it organized and accessible. I'm not even super concerned about germs, it's just THAT clean! It is $20 for 90 minutes of play. It isn't a cheap excursion, but it is so so worth it! We love this place!"

One nice thing is nice is that your kid can be within eye sight the whole time. I also have a 7 month old and they did not charge for him which is a big deal when you're visiting somewhere like this with multiple children! We'll definitely be buying a monthly pass to Dreamland."

There are different sections for the kids to travel to and engage in different activities. My kids spent a lot of time in the obstacle course/ball pit, but they also really enjoyed the hammock swing quiet room that had blocks. You can bring your own food and drink and cone and go as you please which means you can break for nap or lunch and return. They keep your belongings safe behind the counter and do a number system to make sure kids go home with the correct adults. It's a very chill place, kids can get energy out but it doesn't overwhelm you as a parent."

The setup is great for littles AND parents because it’s easier to spot your little one so I was able to sit back and watch with my newborn while my toddlers ran around. They also have coffee and allow you to bring in your own drinks and snacks. We decided to do the monthly membership because their prices are super affordable and the kiddos had so much fun… also it’s a great way to stay out of the summer heat and let your littles get some energy out!"

We were very surprised that it wasn't crazy busy on a Saturday, but I'm assuming not enough people know about it yet. Every single staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and ask if we needed anything/had any questions.

You can pay once, play,  and leave if you need to grab lunch or something, then you can come back and play more.

They stayed active the whole time we were there, cleaning, asking if we needed anything, offering to make coffee, etc. I feel they are priced fairly and have a variety of activities to keep the kiddos entertained and also plenty of places for parents to sit. They  have planned it out so thoughtfully having things like tables and chairs, highchairs, changing rooms (with extra diapers and wipes), nursing areas, multiple bathrooms, AND it's all very well kept and clean which is a big deal to me! Hixson has needed something like this for a long time and I am praying and rooting for their business to be so successful!!!"

They were so friendly and genuinely engaging with the kids—even jumping into a few games with them, which made it even more fun! 🥰\nThey checked in on us several times and were constantly cleaning—vacuuming, mopping, wiping things down. The entire place was spotless, which made it feel extra welcoming and safe. 🧼👏\nThere are several fun areas for kids to explore. My 7-year-old especially loved the air hockey and foosball tables, while my 5-year-old was all about the playhouse with the kitchen and toys 🍳🏠\nAnd for us parents? Tons of comfy seating and a cozy little coffee/tea bar—such a thoughtful touch. ☕💕\nBut what really stood out was the outstanding service. It’s rare to find a place where the owner personally offers to make you coffee and checks in to make sure you're comfortable. That kind of personal touch goes a long way ❤️\nMy kids have asked to go back every single day since our visit… so yes, it’s safe to say we’ve found a new favorite spot 😄\nIf you get the chance, seriously—go check them out!"

Also, they have free coffee and tea for adults.\n\nI’ve been to just about every play gym around, and this is by far the cleanest one. I’ve been four times now, and each visit leaves me even more impressed. My kids (ages 3 and 20 months) have the time of their lives every single time — it’s the kind of place they never want to leave.\n\nIf you’re looking for a safe, clean, joy-filled space for your kids to play their hearts out, Jumpin’ Jellybeans is it.

We love that you can bring your own food/drinks to enjoy in the cafe, and they even provide coffee/tea!

My 2 1/2 year old could have stayed and played all day! The owner checked on us multiple times while we were there to make sure things were going ok! The cafe space is so cute and you can’t beat a free coffee!!! We’ll definitely be back!"

Will definitely return as it will probably be on our rotation of great places to bring our sons and meet up with other parents."

You can even leave and come back with your toddler having a nap. All of Chattanooga needs to get this out with people having young toddlers. I will definitely be coming back in the bear future. Great staff as well. It was a great day for them. I don't have a single complaint about this great place for toddlers. 🤗"

The other great thing about this place is the staff. Upbeat and happy from the beginning, but also very attentive to keeping this place clean and spotless.

My 3 year old and I spent all day here with just a quick break for lunch and the entire time we were gone she was talking about wanting to go back. We loved that once you pay your admission you can come and go all day- your kid can even leave and come back later in the day with a different adult if they have a babysitter, parent, or grandparent bring them back. And their hours are so much better than other local play places- they are open late into the evening!  The staff was so friendly and interactive with both the adults and kids. The place was so clean and well run. They were constantly cleaning floors, bathrooms, play structures, toys, everything so you actually know it is clean! The variety of toys and activities is great for all ages. It's great for both cautious and adventurous kids. I also loved as a parent that they were super diligent about making sure kids went home with the correct adult they came with. Most play places don't even watch the door but this place had a gate and safety measures in place. We will definitely be going back and getting a membership in the future!"

You can bring outside food and drink as long as it stays in the café area. There is free coffee available to parents. The ball pit, arcade area, and playhouse provide ample opportunities for getting energy out! We are so lucky to have a small business owner opening up a facility like this in Hixson! Thank you for being so considerate during our visit and making sure the place stayed clean and organized even with all the kids running around."

Understandably, they have a penalty for rebooking on a different date, but they took our deposit instead.  We had a reschedule expecting a small loss in the deposit (penalty as the website says), but they ended up taking our deposit.  What's the incentive now for rebooking if we lose the same money as someone who completely cancels?  We spoke to the employee there about our disagreement with the decision and the owner was there reinforcing the decision.  I think this is bad practice and their policy is unclear and ambiguous.  No consideration for loyalty to the business with three previous bookings.  If we could have rebooked with a partial loss of the deposit we would have been fine with it.  We won't be booking any more birthdays here unfortunately."

Coincidently neither that child's parent nor any staff was around. I observed the incident from across the way. Now I had been watched the whole time I was there. I realized it was because we were the only ones there who did not look like everyone else.  In fact, the Manager had approached me at one point and asked me if we were leaving prior to this incident, and I said no. (Never figured out why he would ask that.) Later I thought, well, maybe it was a hint and we should have left then. I let the child and the parent (who told me I was ignorant because I did not want to speak with him) know that the bullying was unacceptable behavior. I assured the manager that that we would not ever return. I feel they probably prefer that certain people not patronize their business anyway."

The price hasn’t changed and a lot of the soft mats have tape applied to them and the trampolines are sagging. It needs a refresh and maintenance.

The lady at front was super helpful and the staff was really sweet but I feel like more should be done for making sure children are safe. It’s clear that parents do not pay the slightest attention to their kids here. There were a group of kids throwing objects at other kids faces and after confronting the mom, she did nothing but sit there while her children still continued to throw toys and balls at other kids faces. It’s definitely not the staffs job to parent or control other people’s kids but there should be some sort of protocol for removing children if they aren’t being nice to others or at least make the smaller area for smaller children only. It was disgusting watching older toddlers throwing objects at infant faces and nothing was done."

I completely understand the need to close for private parties — it’s a great way to provide a special experience. But it would be much better if these closures were communicated in advance. It’s really disappointing to show up only to find out it's closed, especially when we could’ve planned something else for the day. My little one was heartbroken and cried when we couldn’t go in because of a private party.\n\nAnother confusing part is that the map and online listings show the hours as 9 AM to 6 PM, which makes us think it’s open. That adds to the frustration when we arrive and it’s not. Now, we feel like we have to call every time before visiting just to be sure. Clearer communication would really help families like ours plan better and avoid disappointment."

I was touched to see the coloring pages they added to the tables that went along with my party's theme. The staff was great!\nI would highly recommend planning your next birthday party with them!"

I got really excited when I first started reading and checking out the website, I thought I finally found a place for my son to be able to spend time at this summer. A place where he would be understood, would be safe and able to socialize while allowing me a small break.\nPart of being on the spectrum is every child is so different, some aren’t able be potty trained and some are. I wish there were places that were actually inclusive to the whole spectrum, not just claiming to be."

I rated it 4/5 as we had our son's birthday party and we were notified a week prior to the party on their restriction. The first 1.5 hours are in the gym and the last 30 minutes is reserved for cake/food and presents in the party room as they need time to clean up the gym and do not want kids eating and then playing on the equipment leading to them becoming sick. The website states, \"Access to entire facility for 2 hours.\" This is not true. We, all the kids, presents, decorations, and food had to be out by the five o'clock time. (our rental was 3-5) This lead to much stress. I also missed out on my son opening half of his gifts and thanking the parents for coming. . You are allowed 30 minutes to set up. 15 minutes would have been perfect and then 15 to take down and pack would have been better. In the end, we will not be having another birthday party here"

The only reason I give 4/5 stars is because you can’t pay for only one hour of play, and 2 hours of play gets to be just too long for our toddler. We pay the $14 for 2 hours and have always ended up leaving around the 1 hour mark. If there was the option to pay $7 for just one hour, I’d easily give it 5/5 stars!"

With a mission that boldly declares, \"Finally a place where you never have to say I'm sorry,\" this gym is truly a haven for children of all abilities.\n\nMy eleven-year-old son and I spent a weekend exploring the sensory-friendly activities offered at We Rock the Spectrum, and it was an experience that left us in awe. The gym boasts an extensive range of equipment, each thoughtfully designed to cater to various sensory needs. From suspended swings for balance and vestibular treatment to crash mats and pillows for fun, motor planning, and strength, the gym has it all.\n\nOne standout feature is the zip slider, providing stress release and promoting joint and body relaxation. The trampoline offers a fantastic opportunity for building leg and core strength, while the indoor play structure enhances climbing skills and playground expertise. The inclusion of sensory-based toys and equipment is a testament to the gym's commitment to improving auditory processing and fine motor skills.\n\nWe Rock the Spectrum goes beyond physical activities, offering a fine motor and arts and crafts area that aids in improving hand-eye coordination. The calming room, designed for regulating emotions and reducing negative sensory input, is a thoughtful touch, providing a quiet space for children to find balance.\n\nDuring our visit, my son, although initially overwhelmed by the new environment, showed genuine interest and enthusiasm. Despite not lasting long during our first visit, he expressed a desire to return—a testament to the gym's engaging and accommodating atmosphere.\n\nNot only did our time at We Rock the Spectrum provide a fun and inclusive experience, but it also offered valuable insights into new equipment that can benefit my son at home. The gym's commitment to inclusivity and overall awesomeness earns it a well-deserved 10/10 rating. We Rock the Spectrum is more than just a gym; it's a supportive community that understands and embraces the diverse needs of every child. I highly recommend this extraordinary space to families seeking a place where their children can play, grow, and thrive without limitations."

The party ended at 3:30 and we had to be out at 3:30, so having to clean up shortened the party even more. They put you on a set schedule and I felt stressed the whole time to stay on schedule. The staff kicked us out of the party room 30 min early to clean up for the next party and took my decorations down before I even got pictures :/ and they said they wouldn’t touch my decorations.\n\nI think this would be a decent place to have a party if I wasn’t so rushed and had more time before and after to set up/clean up."

It’s always super clean, the staff is always friendly, and the environment is warm and cozy.\nBut I did want to share my experience on 7/22/24. Per usual, we were having a pleasant time, but there was a man there with his grandchild who seemed to be sick. He was constantly blowing his nose every minute… literally! And he was also picking his nose without tissue. He would then go about touching the surfaces and toys that the children were touching and that made me uncomfortable. I did speak with a staff member, and informed her that we would be leaving and not completing our scheduled playtime because of this. She did offer an apology and was very polite. I just wish they could have offered some type of pass to come back another day and get the 30 mins that we lost.  However, this would not discourage me from visiting WonderLab again. I have been numerous times and it has always been amazing.\n\n*Update:\nThe Wonder Lab’s management team did reach out to me via email and helped correct the situation. Wonderful customer service  and a wonderful team!"

They allow outside catering, so I decide the food budget. The entire space is yours for a birthday party, so everyone is comfortable. I had the ability to use their tables, tape, existing decor, so I just had to add my unique touches.\n\nHighly recommend for your kiddo’s birthday party!"

My kids been wanting to go back often so I renewed my membership. This place is clean and very well maintained. I been to a lot of these indoor places across the country and I will say this is the most comfortable and versatile indoor playground.  👌 ❤️\n\nThis place is a great indoor place for my 5 and 7 year old,  but one of the younger girls (blonde) in the front desk need to have an attitude adjustment. I have a membership there and I been coming here for almost a year. I might plan a party here in a few months,  but if staff is not up to par with customer service I might have to find other options."

I decided to call my husband to come back all the way here to bring me 3.00 . I told them he would be here soon and they made my 20 month old and I wait inside the gated area for 12 minutes geezers! Instead of letting us inside ! The girls were whispering back and forth.  I will never ever step foot back in this place again!

This was my last time supporting this place I've been here before and everytime those two are there they give me a hard time. I will spend my hard earned money where my business is wanted. Besides the rude customer service the kids enjoy themselves."

Bring socks for everyone, even you mom and dad. No shoes allowed for anyone past the door and socks are required. You have to be shoeless and have socks even if you're just sitting and watching. Its a cute fun place for the littles."

The slide in the toddler room has a huge crack in it. I literally watched a girls foot get stuck in it. If you go all the way to the top of the play structure you can see the top of some of the tunnels and they are CAKED in dust. They probably haven't been cleaned in years. We went to the snack bar and asked how much the drinks were and the guy working had an attitude and was rude when we asked prices since they don't have any prices displayed. Hopefully they do some maintenance and some training for their staff!"

It smelled clean, it felt clean, it was awesome. Best I’ve seen it. I was thoroughly impressed. The employees were constantly busy cleaning if they weren’t helping families.  I never saw anyone just standing around. Outstanding. We were there for 4 hours today!\n\nSpecial shout out to Mr Don- he was so kind and helpful to the kids, and also kindly corrected kids when needed (walking UP the slides instead of going down, etc).  Extremely friendly\n\nPrevious:\nWe recently moved to the area, and I needed somewhere to take my kids when it was too hot to be outside, and I didn’t want to drive into the city.  Bubba is AWESOME.  My 4 and 7 year old both run around for HOURS, and have a blast.  I like that there are multiple seating options for the parents (though having tables that don’t rock would be a huge plus), and that parents can play as well.  The security checkpoint at the exit is amazing- you aren’t leaving with kids who don’t match your code!\n\nThe staff are always doing something- checking people in, cleaning, putting balls back.  They are friendly and helpful. Bathrooms are clean (HUGE perk to a kids Playzone), snacks are available and fairly priced.\n\nThis place is perfect for when I need a few hours to get some stuff done, or just want to read while my kids run out their crazies. We’ve been multiple times, and will continue to return as long as Bubba maintains the current conditions!"

The ball vacuums are broken and have been for some time and but it’s still a hit for the toddlers to just hold the button down.

No one knew or cared that we had ordered food. I will never book here again, totally pointless. We had family from out of town who came expecting food and we had nothing- not even an apology from the staff for completely f’ing up. We were not even given the time we paid for- they were 15 minutes late into cleaning the room, we had to set up, didn’t get our food and barely drinks, plus we were expected to leave out of the room, even though they did not give us the time we had PAID for. We should have gotten the 15 minutes they had taken out of the time we had originally. UNPROFESSIONAL! Don’t waste your time, please take your business to Breakaway Indoor playground in Edmond! Parking is better, staff is better and actually present so your children don’t get hurt, and their equipment isn’t breaking.\n\nAlso it is policy you place orders upon arrival- no one asked us what we ordered and I presented it three times to four staff members. The staff doesn’t even follow policy. The manager, courtney, will argue with you and explain to you why it’s anyone fault but theirs! She will block you on Facebook so you can’t make a Facebook review, they will lie on all the reviews you make and they won’t get back with you when you ask to speak to someone higher up. They even came and found me while I was playing with my son to make sure we “didn’t leave without paying.” Unprofessional in many ways, but how could I possibly leave without paying if they’re supposed to be a check-in and check-out facility FOR THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN?!"

Sad to say parents will be on their phones instead of making sure their kids are safe. We look forward to getting passes for winter! Thanks again!"

          "content": "My baby and I came for their “New Mommy” play date event. Safe to say, he had so much fun. Seeing him being able to actually interact and play with children that fall within his age group was amazing (he is 8 months). He definitely was able to thrive given in other spaces, the kids were very much in their toddler years so although he wanted to engage in play, he wasn’t able to.\n\nSpace: I can appreciate the fact that Hümanette has a space dedicated to infants (0-18 months) but they do not have to be confined to that area. I love that they have a cozy, comfortable nursing room that’s just off of the infant play area for breastfeeding moms. Also, socks are required! Which is a positive in my book. Overall, the space has plenty of elbow room and is well organized.\n\nPricing: Their prices for the play passes and play packs are super reasonable. I like that the cost for 0-18 months and even the older kids are a bit cheaper due to how they will actually utilize the space versus a set price for a child regardless of their age. The membership price could be daunting to look at BUT when you add up all that it has to offer, it’s a really good deal.\n\nPlay Periods: They stick to their play periods to the T BUT the good thing is play passes are good for all day play, which allows for that flexibility, especially with schedules. Them sticking to the times is a huge plus for me though, especially during the flu/RSV season. They are able to not only reset the play space but SANITIZE it as well.\n\nFood/Beverages: I’ve had the avocado toast w/ egg + matcha latte w/ oat milk & honey. Both really good as well as the sunflower “pb&j”. The ONLY “negative” would be that the food menu doesn’t offer a lot of options, which if they did would be super convenient. ON THE FLIP SIDE, there are quite a few food options within walking distance and due to its location, Hümanette is super close to other parts of the city that one can get to within 5 minutes for even  more options. Therefore, it wasn’t worth me taking a star off.\n\nOverall, I am happy with Hümanette and am excited to continue to come for play dates with my little."

They have a great selection of toys for infants and the place is super clean, he could roam around and explore freely, climb, slide and play.  The coffee was also really good and the staff was so friendly. I got the chance to chat with the owner for a bit and she was so nice. I can’t recommend this place enough if you’re looking for a fun and affordable spot for your kiddos to play. My son is 10 months but they also have a big kids room so I would recommend this place for ages 10 months to 10 years!"

The pricing is reasonable, and the thoughtfully designed play stations offer a great experience for kids. While we didn’t try the drink and menu options, it’s nice to know they’re available. I truly hope this place thrives, as it provides primary caregivers like myself the opportunity to catch up on emails or handle other tasks while our kids play in a safe, clean, and comfortable environment. I loved the attention to detail and the variety of activities for my curious little ones!"

Many of us took advantage of the coffee bar and enjoyed the delicious beverages (I personally had a hot latte with sugar free caramel. VERY tasty). There was something for everyone.

Comfortable seating for parents but, the play area for kids can't be larger than 1000 sq ft. Overall it was enjoyable, glad it's close and very very affordable."

The party ended at 3 pm and I was in my car heading home by 3:10 - what a relief no clean up!!! While my life was made easier by Jess's help with setting up/cleaning up, most importantly my son had seriously the best time. Him & his friends played crazy (as 4 year old boys do!) in the play area while the adults were able chat & enjoy the afternoon! Definitely recommend this space for any private event!"

There were about 30 adults and kids altogether for his birthday party, and there was plenty of space for everyone. I would highly recommend Rough and Bumble for your child’s birthday party! It was a hit with our guests, and stress-free for us to plan."

What she says they offer in the party details, they deliver it 110%!! I couldn’t be happier, my son had an amazing birthday and thanks to Jess I actually got to enjoy it with him!"

Katelyn (spelling?) was our host and she was so attentive, kind and organized. As a mama I really enjoyed not having to host, especially the no clean up part!! They even had some extra paw patrol themed decorations they let us borrow!! I can’t recommend renting out the place enough!

It’s very different from other indoor play places. It’s got a lounge type feel, boutique style type feel, play place type feel and FUN place type feel. They also have the most delicious chia tea! Ask for their raspberry flavor if it’s in season!\n\nYou can also get work done and sit at a work area and have the ease of mind your babe is playing as you watch alongside and tend to work/study obligations simultaneously.\n\nI give Rough and Bumble KC ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ and two 👍🏼👍🏼\n\nThe owner is super awesome and sweet too!"

It’s small enough that I can just sit and watch my kids play — I don’t have to hover/keep tabs on them like I do at Science City or Wonderscope. The cafe has yummy drinks and food. One thing to note is that they do not allow outside food or drinks — I wasn’t aware the first time we came."

The pizza was delicious and the pretzel bites are out of this world with the cheese sauce and mustard!! 🤤 Drinks amazing too, highly recommend the patio paloma drink off the menu.\n\nWe've really enjoyed the bowling but just know, you pay by the hour and also, shoes are not included. Be prepared to spend a decent amount especially if large family.\nMaybe consider a family pack to get people coming back 🙏\nThe mini golf was super fun but too hot already and definitely could've used some misters or more shade. I think some fun things could be added to the course to make it better as well.\n\nWe are excited to return and try the laser tag.\nThanks HeyDay 🤘see you again soon."

There’s also a family-friendly bowling area and a small restaurant space, which made it easy to grab snacks and take breaks in between games.\n\nOne of my favorite parts was the upstairs adult-only area—a nice touch for parents who want to enjoy some grown-up time. It felt like a more chill space away from the high energy of the main arcade.\n\nWhether you’re a local in the Moore/Norman area or just passing through, I’d definitely recommend stopping by for a few hours of fun. There’s something here for everyone!"

          "content": "My review has to do with the atmosphere at the facility. I want to start by saying I visited on a Memorial Day Monday at 11 o’clock 2025- not late in the evening and I realize many may not agree with me but for those who do this is your warning.\n\nFirst, I do not let my children or grandchildren, watch music videos, such as candy shop among others (look it up if you don’t know what it is, I didn’t. The artist is 50 cent I believe). These videos portray, highly sexualized images of women gyrating in a suggestive manner and are not appropriate for young children. If these had been on upstairs in the 21 and over bowling then fine. They were not there, however, they are in the bowling alley on the big screen so children must look at them if they are going to toss their ball down the lane.\nThe music is also very loud. While I realize this is something in our culture that we don’t seem to care about much anymore, it is so loud it is likely damaging the hearing of those who work in this environment on a continual basis as well as patrons. We teach about cumulative damage to hearing at health fairs so I know this is something many will regret later in life.\nWe had a good experience with laser tag and the outdoors mini golf. Even the bowling would’ve been fine without the videos. But I will not be back because I will not expose my grandchildren to it.\nSomeone is going to find this review helpful. And I’m sure I am not the only one who finds these videos inappropriate for young children.\n\nDoes heyday care more about making a cultural statement or their profits? If it’s profit how about more kid friendly videos during day time hours, and a hearing safe environment? When you address these I’ll be back and re-review"

The lanes were in great condition, the atmosphere was lively without being overwhelming, and everything felt clean and well taken care of.\n\nOur server—Adrianna, I believe—was fantastic. She was friendly, attentive, and always seemed to show up right when we needed something, whether it was refilling drinks or checking in on our order. Even with how busy it was, she never seemed rushed and made us feel like we were well taken care of.\n\nIt really added to our night and made our group outing even more fun. We’ll definitely be coming back, and we appreciate the great service from Adrianna and the whole HeyDay team!"

Was bringing a group, but after that I left and we changed locations won’t be back."

This isn’t your average entertainment center — it’s a full-blown experience. ✨🎳🍔\n\nFrom the moment you step inside, it’s clear: HeyDay knows how to set the mood. Neon lights, great music, laughter echoing from the bowling lanes, and that unmistakable buzz of people having an absolute blast. Whether you're on a date night, out with friends, or bringing the whole fam, this place delivers the vibes. 💃🕺🎯\n\nI went in expecting a casual good time and left thinking, “Okay...this is my new go-to.” The food? Way better than expected. We're talking next-level bar & grill vibes — think juicy burgers, loaded fries, and shareables that actually make you want to share (well... maybe). 🍔🍟 And the drinks? 🍹 Let’s just say the bartenders know their way around a good pour. Creative cocktails + local brews = winning combo.\n\nAdd in the arcade games, laser tag, ropes course, and upscale bowling — and you’ve got the kind of place that makes you lose track of time in the best way possible. Whether you're leveling up your game or just relaxing in the lounge, HeyDay brings that perfect mix of excitement and chill.\n\nThe staff? Super friendly, helpful, and genuinely seem to enjoy being there — and that energy is contagious. 🙌\n\n📍 HeyDay Entertainment\nNorman, OK\n🎳 Bowling • 🎮 Arcade • 🍔 Food • 🍹 Drinks • 🧗‍♂️ Ropes Course\nPerfect for parties, date nights, and spontaneous fun\n\n#TrustedLens #GooglePhotographer #SnapAndReview #EpicShots #NextLevelGuide #RoadToLevel9 #LocalGuideLife #ExploreOKC #HiddenGemsOK #OKCSpots #MetroMusts\n🎭 #FunTimesOKC #MustSeeSpots #WeekendPlans #HeyDayNorman #UnforgettableMoments #SipAndSavor #BowlingVibes #GameNightGoals #ArcadeDreams #OKCAdventures"

Go somewhere better and friendlier like main event. The only reason we came to heyday was because it was more local for our friends but NEVER AGAIN.\n\nEdit: make sure if you go to heyday that you have double the amount of money you’re planning to spend in your account as they like to double charge you when they force you to put a card on file for FOOD and place a week long merchant hold on your money plus what they’re actually charging you!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!!\n\nOriginally a three star review:\nMy friends and I went to get some food and go bowling to catch up and have some fun. We unfortunately went when it was spring break which I get is a busier time. However, they were severely understaffed and at times I saw individuals that looked like management just standing doing nothing which is disappointing when service was slow. I will give it to them that their pricing for food and bowling isn’t outrageous and is on the cheaper side compared to other entertainment places. BUT I can’t get past that they charged 4 DOLLARS for drinks that came in a small plastic cup, which wouldn’t be an issue if there was service checking in regularly for refills. Also the fact that the food took almost an hour to get delivered and was lukewarm at best. Needless to say I think it’s worth it to come if you expect poor service or aren’t planning on ordering food and drinks."

We have came here many times and my son who is living with autism always wants to do laser tag can never participate because it’s too loud and can be overstimulating, finally got to experience and enjoy it. The young man behind the counter, Gage was so sweet to accommodate my son and turn the volume off so my son can play with his friend and our family. I just appreciate him so much, as a mom to an autistic child it made me tear up with happiness that we had that experience and it was made possible. Thank you so much!!"

This is one of the safest layouts. It has 3 levels but no long straight “stairs” so that even if you’re little one were to tumble down them, it wouldn’t be too far and injury is unlikely.\nThey are one of the cleanest as well, you don’t see as much dust and grime in hard to clean places as you do at a lot of places.\n\nThis place is also in great repair. Any time I see something torn up or broken, it is inevitably repaired by the next time I visit. There are some places that have had duct-taped pads, ripped netting, and exposed metal bolts for at least two years that I can confirm. (Don’t go to Buba’s)\n\nFive stars, I can’t recommend this place enough!"

We had a great time. It was safe, it was clean, well maintained, they even have a small part sectioned off for smaller kids. Although my 3 year old was able to play on the big kid side too until like lunch time when it got busy. If you want a nice place to take the kids in the morning then I would recommend.

They have a sign where it’s a place for kids up to 12 years old to play, though I honestly think it’s better suited for kids between ages 1-10. The older ones might not get as much out of it. I’ve thrown a few birthday parties here for my kids, but their older cousins tend to get bored pretty quickly. That said, my kids absolutely love it (and so do I—at least for them!). The place is always kept really clean, and you’ll see staff walking around making sure everything’s in top shape. The bathrooms are also spotless and they have a diaper-changing station. Plus, they offer free coffee while you’re there, which is a nice touch. Snacks for the kids are available, and prices for entry and snacks aren’t too bad. One tip: definitely bring socks since they’re required, unless you want to shell out for a pair on-site. Parking can be tricky on weekends since it gets pretty crowded, but it’s worth it!"

          "content": "I would say the only negative about this place is the people who are older teens/young adults than the place is made for playing on the stuff that’s meant for kids and nothing being done about it. I get playing with your kids but it’s not them playing with their kids, it’s kids having to wait for the older people to move out of the way. With that being said, I still am giving five stars because the facility deserves it. The bathroom is just beautiful, probably cleaner than the one at even my house let alone a public place that caters to children. The staff is extremely friendly, the facility itself is very clean, lots of places for parents to sit, big enough to follow your toddler or small child through the play places. It’s is so much to be able to interact with the kids, meet other parents/grandparents/guardians and not have to be in the heat. It’s the only time my grandson gets to play with littles and it’s important to socialize your kids even at a young age. This place is incredible. We have been to one other place like this and this one is by far nicer and provides more to do. We will be back and have encouraged friends to take their littles there, too."

They had an area in the front for your itsms but also once you past the gate there are plenty of tables where you can leave your stuff. The 0-5 have their own space but can also join the bigger playground area. I did notice some of the littles almost getting hurt if they ran under the monkey bar area though. They have free coffee for adults. And a snack shop with reasonable prices. It was very clean and service was great ! Definitely recommend."

They have little carts to help bring everything in and out. You get an hour and a half in the party room which is nice because its not rushed, then we just moved to the public tables to continue playing at the end of the party. The owner also made sure I got all the excess socks of the kids that didnt show since we paid for 12 kids which I appreciated. Definitely recommend throwing a party here.\n\nWe came here a few days ago and my kids are still raving and begging to go back. The staff was all very friendly and all smiles which was nice. There was plenty of seating for parents and lots of snack & drink options. The play area is the biggest, nicest one we have seen out of all indoor playgrounds in the city. It is so well done and they are constantly walking around cleaning and ensuring kids aren't climbing slides etc. My oldest decided he wants his party here so we just booked today and are looking forward to a birthday experience here! We would 100% recommend this playground to everyone, even younger ones. They have a 5 & under area which is the most impressive I've seen as well."

The woman at the front desk was about to provide us with shoe covers, but the manager or owner intervened and directed her not to, instead offering us socks. Although I was uncomfortable with the idea of taking off my shoes, I complied with his request.\nThe situation became even more troubling when we chose a seat right by the entrance. We noticed that the same manager gave shoe covers to a caucasian woman and her daughter who had just arrived. This raised immediate questions for me—why were they given shoe covers while we were not? The manager had previously warned us that the shoe covers could be slippery and dangerous, yet he still chose to provide them to an older caucasian woman, who was over 70.\nThis behavior not only felt discriminatory but also left me feeling uneasy. It made me question his intentions: Did he not want us to have the shoe covers, or was he recklessly indifferent to the safety of the older woman? It’s disheartening to experience such a stark difference in treatment based on race, and it has left a lasting negative impression on our visit.\n\nHe might attempt to defend himself by saying, \"I'm not racist; I have minorities working for me.\" but it won’t work."

It now forces all the kids into the main play area and it’s beginning to feel very overcrowded, which was the main reason I enjoyed coming here was because it wasn’t like some of the other indoor play areas where it was overcrowded. Just my thoughts. But overall, a really great indoor play space."

The building even has cubbies you can put your things up at and they sell snacks and drinks have multiple places to eat and drink and even have birthday parties they also always play kids bop playlist lol it’s definitely a good time and SO CHEAP!

The battery-powered toys were dead.\n\nLuckily, it was a big place and there were tons of things to do. The only issue I had was that not all parents supervised their children. They let their older children run around unsupervised. We were on the trampoline at one end with other little ones. There was a preteen boy whom I had seen earlier playing with his mother and three other siblings. He ran right up to my daughter and jumped, landing as heavily as he could two inches away from my toddler. If he had missed and landed on her, he would have hurt her. We had to take her off the trampoline. His mother was nowhere near him. I saw her in a different area with her other three children.\n\nParents, if you cannot manage your children, or if your children are not well-behaved, do not bring them at all."

On the top of it pricey for no good reason, the rooms not bright enough, pictures are dark because of the bad lighting. furthermore, we were treated very rude from the their  worker, after we finished from the room, we tried to sat in the craftier while the kids are playing. So we moved some chairs to sat together as a group, the worker came up to us screaming to put the chairs back that we are not allowed to move them. It was so bad for me in front of my guests. So I emailed the owner right away, but I didn’t get any response back. So clearly they do not care. So DO NOT west your money here. Go Urban Air, best customer service and you get what you pay for. The only reason I had my party here, is because I have an infant and I thought here will be better but not."

A lot of the equipment was visibly dirty and the soap was out in the bathroom. Made for an icky feeling in flu season. I went there mainly for the under 2 section and it was pretty depressing. A lot of the play equipment had broken parts. Push- tricycles without handles or steering wheels and broken pieces that my tot kept playing with. Needs some love and new stuff. And soap."

          "content": "I do want to give my review to warn others trying to go.\nTo start off, the place it located in an odd place and was a little hard to locate. When you walk through the first set of doors you cannot advance further. Would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time online. Because trying to buy them on arrival is super frustrating. You are stuck between the two doors that are still the entryway, and so you have to stand there and order tickets while your kids are waiting to get in and other people are trying to get in past you. I tried 2 different cards online and it didn't work (which my cards worked fine before and after this place and have plenty of money)  So my friend had to use hers, and it worked. I look at my account and they charge my account four times and then charged it an additional four times for a dollar fee. It charged me four times and we never got any code.So my cards were working, but the website was weird. Then I see there's multiple refunds on my account while we are there. Then I all of a sudden, get 2 emails with codes 30 minutes later. What's someone else's name on it? Which doesn't make sense since I used my phone?So how was there someone else's name on my code. I went to run outside to grab a water and had my daughter stand by the door to let me back in. Since I didn't have the code and it was on my friend's phone. However, they have it so that you cannot open the door from the inside, no handles, which is a safety hazzard. And my daughter couldn't open the door to let me back in. My daughter had to run through and find my friend to give me the code. My friend even walked over to open the door but they have no handles on the inside to open the door for me. So I had to wait for her to find the code on her phone again for me to enter it. What she had to hold up to the glass so I could see to enter the code to enter in again even though we were already inside and had already paid. It doesn't appear that there's any staff there at all to help you. Kind of makes me worry that there's nobody there if there were problems. To add to that, I would say, the price is pretty high for what's there. The pictures online look much cooler than the place actually is and the pictures online are kind of deceiving. The cost to get in there is the same cost as urban air and urban area is much better quality. I would say the place is just okay, but honestly I think the admission should be about anywhere from $5 to $8. They have some cool features, but it really is just an indoor play set. I have been to other indoor playgrounds that charge a lot less. The signs everywhere are a little intense. At one point another boy hurt my daughter and her finger looked broken, I don't think it is but very swollen but there are no staff to ensure safety and that kids are not being too aggressive. Just so many odd signs, one of them being that it's a crime to enter without paying, which duh...  you should pay. But then even more signs in the two year old area that if you are able to read the sign that you're too old to be in this area. Which also a duh. But if there were some staff there to ensure rules were being followed, there wouldn't need to be so many signs. I don't know. Just overall, experience wasn't very good especially  trying to get in and the handle less door was not the greatest, priced too high, buying tickets in-between the outside doors with the cold was a little ridiculous. I don't normally leave reviews, but wanted to leave this because if I would have seen a review like this.I probably would have tried to go somewhere else.\n\nTo also add i tried calling my friend's phone and she didn't see my call and may daughter almost couldn't hear me through the glass door so I can to shout for her to hear me. If my daughter hadn't not been by the door and my friend never saw her phone I would have been locked outside for a long time. Which is also worrisome.\n\nMy 7YO and 6YO were bored in the first few minutes of being here i had to convince them to stay and try and make friends since we spent so much money to get in."

Thankfully there was soap at the sink in the seating area. I wish there was a phone number posted around the building that you can text if something needs attention. Then the owners can assess if it needs immediate attention or can wait until later. I’ve tried emailing in the past but haven’t gotten quick responses.\n\nOverall, I appreciate this place and what it’s provided for us, but wish it was better updated and maintained for the price we pay."

The flooring was in terrible shape—buckling in several areas—which created serious tripping hazards. I witnessed multiple children fall due to the uneven surface. It’s simply not a safe environment for children.\n\nI cannot recommend this place based on our experience. Safety and customer service should be top priorities, and unfortunately, neither were present during our visit."

There was no employees besides the one at the front desk who was in her phone the entire time. While being  there there the same child pushed my 6 year old into a wall and my 11 month old down and took toys from him. You would think they would have other employees to help supervise."

I went to the front where the person is at checking in people and supposedly watching (worker was on her phone And never even looked up) the entrance/exit and told her that I could not locate my granddaughter could she please look on camera and show me where she was at.  Lady wasn't very concerned and finally got up and started showing me the camera footage. While looking at the camera footage a lady walked in outta mall and asked if anyone was missing a kid. Said they saw a little girl half way down the mall that had only socks on.  I took off through the mall to find her.  The worker never said anything didn't try to go with me and help look, nothing.  I found her and went back to playground to get my friend and the other kids.  Still no one at the playground said anything to me.  I asked to speak with manager/owner and was told they weren't there.  I asked when would they be available worker said they never come in.  Told me I needed to go on web site and contact them that way.   So I went to web site but there is no way to contact anyone on there.  I have called back up there and worked said \"sorry there is no way to contact them\"."

But the bathrooms were out of soap and the employees said they were out and the owner was out of state. Seems kinda gross to me.  They did have handsanitizer... but that was your only option. The parent area is tight but all in all adequate to watch your kids. Employees were helpful when my kid lost her socks.  They found every other kids socks but not mine, so we had to buy new ones.  Other then that they were busy playing card games and doing their own thing.  For me and the needs of my kids it is a great place to keep them entertained so my husband and I could tag team christmas shopping.  I wouldn't go here for any other reason.  But,  to have one of us shop and the other to let the kids play and swap it worked perfect. Comparing this to the indoor playgrounds in the malls in California, it was pitiful but for a place to contain  your kids... this was much easier then the playground on the first floor."

The ball pit needs more balls, there’s not nearly as many as there used to be and a fair amount are crushed. The air cannons on the top level need a better way to get the foam balls up there. As is the kids have to climb up with what they can carry in 1 hand because climbing requires the other. They offer a punch card and they offer a free session once it’s full. We’ll be back."

The price for play used to be $10. I don’t think the cost is worth it. The toys are dated and cheap, even the music is some off brand music. They haven’t updated to warrant this increase at all imo. I am not the only one, other parents in line yesterday also seemed a bit shocked at the price jump. Hopefully it is just temporary, because I can’t justify that anymore."

When we exited the bathroom stall we were told the party is private and to leave. We couldn't even wash our hands! There were no signage anywhere! How were we to know!\n\nYou made my 4 year old son wait outside the building until we exited the restroom and left the womens restroom door open while my 6 year old used it! You compromised my childrens safety and didn't even ask what we needed or how you could help us! It's a way to appropriately handle things but clearly you didn't care.

          "content": "Vaseem is by far the worst and disrespectful owner I’ve encountered at a kids’ indoor playland. I visited Dino Kidz with my children on a Tuesday afternoon, about two and a half hours before closing time. I had previously purchased a 10-pass package and planned to use it. However, the front desk staff told me the pass had expired back in December of last year.\n\nThis confused me because I clearly remembered visiting recently, so I asked when my last visit was. The staff checked and confirmed that I had been there in February of this year. That means I had already used the pass even after it supposedly expired, and at that time, no one informed me that the pass was no longer valid. In fact, I was told I had two passes remaining.\n\nWhen I pointed out this inconsistency, the staff allowed me to speak with the owner, Vaseem. During the call, he told me, “You already brought your kids in for free in February—now you want to do it again?” He accused me of trying to manipulate the situation.\n\nBut the truth is, I didn’t enter for free—I had already paid for the 10-pass package in advance. He continued to imply that I was trying to get something for nothing and spoke to me with condescension and sarcasm.\n\nAt no point was I informed that my pass had expired or that I wouldn’t be able to use the remaining visits. No notice or reminder was ever sent out. As a busy mom juggling a lot, how am I expected to keep exact track of the expiry date of a kids’ indoor play pass?\n\nDespite the fact that the place was nearly empty and closing time was approaching, and even though I was simply trying to use something I had already paid for, Vaseem told me to either purchase at least one single pass (since I had two kids with me) or leave. He claimed this was the “best favor” he could offer and told me, “Take it or leave it.”\n\nThe way he treated me—like someone trying to freeload—was incredibly insulting. I’ve visited this place many times before, often for playdates with friends. But after experiencing this petty and disrespectful behavior from the owner, I will absolutely not be returning, nor will I recommend this place to anyone else."

Fun.\n\nBut there’s an INCREDIBLY LOUD “hammer cock and machine gun” that plays for a couple of minutes with every button press. The air pressure vacuum for it is also loud, but it’s a bass note and you can still hear yourself over it.\n\nThis sound effect is loud enough to drown out the music, any direction to your kids’ conversation. It is awful.\n\nTo the owners: TURN THIS SOUND EFFECT DOWN. I’ve asked the teenager running the facility a few times and they always kind of shrug.\n\nEdit: Still loud as hell."

It was dirty, you could see black residue on all the soft play things. There’s a strong smell when you walk in. We were there an hour and a half and never saw anyone cleaning, or disinfecting anything. Will absolutely not be going back. Definitely don’t recommend for any kid under 5 at the youngest."

Toxic fumes or any kind of essence will trigger an asthma attack on people like me… I’m pretty sure there are plenty of asthmatic kids too"

We had over 40 ppl in the tiny room they have. Its was so crammed and uncomfortable. We spend over a thousand dollars for the worst experience for our daughter and ourselves. I was and am so upset of how bad the experience was. I write this to say PLEASE double check everything because they have people who don’t know how to plan birthday parties."

While I would highly suggest everyone to book Dino Kidz for their child’s birthday party, I do have a couple of suggestions for the owner/management.\n\n1. Shorten the dance party. After a couple songs, the kids lost interest and just wanted to play. I’m sure this varies with age.\n2. Order from a different pizza place. Several of the kids didn’t care for the pizza. And kids eat anything.\n3. Wrap the gift from your facility for the birthday kid! All kids like to open presents. It will make the gift more appealing and the kid feel super special.\n4. If you are going to have machines with “play card” options, maybe include a couple free cards pending which party package the family chooses."

Literally felt like we paid for a room. Young kid that was suppose to be assisting stood in a corner the whole time. I had to go up to him multiple times to ask what was happening “umm you can tell everyone they can dance”. It was embarrassing as all my guest felt awkward and lost as well. I  then went to whom I thought was the boss, she was also absolutely no help. Zero apologies. Had to ask if I needed to serve pizza. Had to ask for juice. It was so bad. Slow to do everything but extremely quick to ask for us to leave and for the final deposit. Which was rudely asked for in front of guest. And one of the most upsetting things; I was never told that it was an additional fee (nor is this pricing listed online) to close the play area to the public (different from other locations) so to our surprise had soooo many other kids there.\nI called Jill (in charge of parties based out of Allen location) and whom had been great and super responsive. She seemed extremely concerned and was very apologetic.\nFinal verdict- they refunded me $50!! And one free visit. - a complete joke.\nSave your money go elsewhere. We had last years party at cheeky monkey and it was complete day and night experience. Never again.\nWe have visited this location before and I should have known by the lack of attentiveness of staff on this visits how this would end. Kids up front on their phone the entire time. And when I asked about booking a party I was swatted away and told it was all done online, later debunked by Jill."

As a first time mom, knowing how hot Texas summer get, it was important to me to find great indoor activities that my toddler could enjoy. We have visited many indoor children's play centers but Dino Kidz really stepped up the bar. They created a beautiful space specifically for toddler aged little ones. The atmosphere is colorful and full of natural light. The dinosaur theme is adorable and the play stations provide the perfect opportunity for each little one to let their creativity and imaginations run free. No matter if your baby is a crawler, climber or a walker there is so much fun to be had. Friendly staff, clean and plenty of seating when it's time for a snack break."

Kaylyn, the manager is incredible and on top of everything. My kids had an amazing time. We were there for four hours. Can you believe it? I would say for kids play area. It had pretty decent food as well for kids and for a quick little nibble when mom is trying to relax.

It was such a GREAT experience from the safe “for toddlers (4 and under) only” area to the in-playground security cameras for adults to have eyes on their kiddos at all times. The staff were friendly and helpful and great with kids. We also appreciated them monitoring the toddler area and clearing out big kids who were not supposed to be in there and were playing too rough around our little guy.\n\nWe loved that we could go through the playground with our little ones, too, so even our toddler got to experience the cool look out spots and hanging bean bag features since we could help him. We loved all the bright, happy colors and the adorable monkey decorations throughout. The place felt overall very clean. The food was reasonably priced.  We will definitely be back next time we’re in town!"

Clearly it isn’t cleaned as I saw the same hair on the sink for all three visits. The toddler step in the family bathroom is covered in urine so that’s clearly overlooked!  If you want people to be return guests, perhaps spend a bit of time on cleanliness!?!?"

I love the clear rules written everywhere!! It answers all my thoughts and questions, wish more places were like this. Socks required. No outside food /drinks. Must sign waiver. Items for sale with price on it. The only location in Prosper (that I know of) so price aligns with other similar businesses in frisco and mckinney."

Jen took photos while my son opened presents which was just SO sweet and something I will treasure forever. They helped take gifts to the car, distributed pizza and drinks, cut the cake, you name it they were there to help with whatever we needed. We will surely be returning for play time and future birthdays."

Although the birthday party couldn't be celebrated however my granddaughter, Mebal, enjoyed it a lot. My son informed me that the playhouse is her favourite place. Concerning the children's ages the playhouse arena is good enough however there's a shortage of places for the accompanying parents. Boutique is not available in its true sense however one can get some clothes in an emergency situation at high costs. Available food for parties and coffee is not expensive nor the playhouse fee. Anyhow this is a blessed place for your child in this hustle life. Some hours of peace in a fast life."

We were sitting in chairs by the tables and when I said I'm having him sit cause he's 1 and not leaving them on the owner Jen Clark replied everyone needed socks period which is crazy if theyre not on equipment. This along with craziness/accusations over if our snacks were bought there (they were) and in general making an extremely uncomfortable atmosphere I recommend going somewhere else like cheeky monkey, safari run, dino kids, kidmania, etc for much more fun at a better price!"

We booked it a couple of months in advance and I didn’t pay attention and had a typo in my email address for the confirmation of booking. They emailed me right away after I contacted them and they changed it to the correct one. So we started off on a great foot. I got an email a few days before the party to confirm everything we had booked. They also let us know that other than pizza we could add everything as needed while there (extra waters, juice more kids than the 11 put in at booking) and we would settle it at the end. Which was super great because we weren’t sure how many kids we would actually have. We got there about 15 min early they took us right to the party room, the hosts introduced themselves and took all of our cupcakes and got them on a nice stand, laid out the plates and napkins and put the favors on top of the plates for us. Basically got the whole room ready. They directed all the kids to the party room. The kids all ran off to play. They had a speaker system to call the kids when it was time to eat. They served the pizzas to all the kids as well as adults, they didn’t let even the adults get their own pizza which was actually really great. They handed out the waters and tended to the kids amazingly. Then at the end they get brought out two wagons and helped us get everything loaded into our car. They really took all the stress away from hosting a birthday party. I cannot say enough good things about prosper playhouse but even more so our two fabulous hosts. It was also very cool temperature wise and clean! Both get major stars from us for that!\nCannot recommend prosper playhouse enough!"

The Owner being upset that I wasn’t spending money at her subpar cafe (Which was entirely untrue seeing as we had already payed $50 entrance for 3 kids buying a water bottle 2 coffees 4 Oreo packages and a $5 cup of MacNcheese) took it upon herself to throw away 2 of my kiddos drink cups because she thought they were juice. Another kiddo had the same type of cup but his wasnt thrown away which is more confusing as to why she needed to throw ours away. Had she done the right thing which was to look for me and politely tell me outside beverages weren’t allowed then I could have explained that I have come many times with the same cup and told as long as it was water it was ok which they had water from a bottle of water I purchased from the cafe. She could have asked I not bring them again I wouldn’t have cared. Instead of owning up to her mistake, realizing she handled it incorrectly and sincerely apologizing she says yea sorry with attitude and rudeness, when I further try to explain that now I have an upset toddler actively crying looking for her baby shark cup she continues with what more do you want I said I was sorry you can either grab them out of the trash or I can give you a cup of water. Suggesting I dig through trash to have my kids put their mouth on them again is disgusting. Also makes me call into question what she thinks is acceptable to do in her cafe. Oh and she didn’t forget to mention that I could just buy another juice cup but couldn’t even be bothered to offer my crying toddler a free juice box since she threw away her cup what toddler would be okay exchanging their favorite character cup for a cup of tap water ?! Needless to say I will never return, I am all for small business but NOT with that awful attitude no thank you ! I’m well aware she’s gonna have some type of remark as she seems to have one for ever bad review instead of owning up to her mistakes and realizing she needs to change her bad attitude as this isn’t the first review mentioning it"

This place was overpriced compared to other competitors. For the overall experience we got, I would not go back! Very sad to have to write this knowing they are a small business!\n\nI figured you would write a response to my review as I’ve seen your prior comments! As a business owner you’re not professional and you tend to give excuses for your staff and not provide solutions to have returning customers! I’m entitled to my own review. I only had one host and she was not friendly. She was rude to the children and I tipped her $15 based on my experience!"

My son loves this place  I really want to give it five stars, but I can't. The age range of the kids here is from infants to big kids. Every time we have gone here, the big kids push my two year out of the way. It has happened every time (we have been here four times now). The way this place is designed, the parents sit and let their kids go wild. (Attention parents: watch your kids and get your head out of your phone.) My two year old can do all of the activities here, but he is on the small side. Bigger kids always push him out of the way or kick/throw the giant balls (yoga balls) at him.\n\nMy two cents: if you have smaller kids, you might want to look elsewhere. If you have bigger kids, then your kids should be fine.\n\nAlso. They do have a free play time on Friday nights with vendors. It is worth your time to check it out."

We also had a birthday party here this past January 2022 and spent $600 on it even when they decided they did the absolute bare minimum.\n\nI decided, okay whatever, we're already here so i'll pay the $15 for the day pass, all I had was cash on me.. The lady up front, rudely, told me that they didn't have change for a $20 bill? Needless to say i'm very disappointed in the customer service shown today.\n\nThey did NOT disclose all the information at the time of purchase, nor did I receive a text message saying that it was expired, and that should be against policy. They with held information to gain sales... As a business owner myself, I understand that business must go on, but I also understand when to accommodate something for a customer when it goes wrong on my end.. and for a business to not carry change when you have a concession stand and boutique?

Areas for under 3 and of course giant multi-level maze of features - slides, bouncy ball room, foam ball cannons, obstacles. Moms and dads, if you're joining, prepare to be on your hands and knees a lot in the maze and/or be ready for the chiro the next day, it's not tall enough for adults to stand in a lot of places (and isn't supposed to be)."

They don't have much space for the little ones and if they go into the area where the other kids do the activity they get upset and aren't very polite when they say things. So I wouldn't have my daughter's birthday there. The idea is to have a great time not for the employees to have ugly faces.\n\nI paid for an hour for my 7 year old daughter to see the place, but it only lasted about 20 minutes. I didn't like the way one of the girls treated me when my little daughter entered the area."

Kids loved the snow room fun\nbut the only drawback is , Snow was accumulated only at one place and it was hard for kids to play or make the shapes and slippery. I think they should keep adjusting it before it becomes ice.\nOverall id definitely recommend hosting a party at Snowy fun."

I gave them sofa to put in freeze for pizza time , they dod not take it out left inside. Play one song and done. They dont even keep playing songs)\n\nPizza they order from macro pizza and they will serve you cold( people dont like it at all)\n\nThey destroy our event with poor service.

The party host was very attentive and helpful. The management even helped walk me through some questions I had about payments. SNOWY FUN was a 30 min drive from my house, and an hour drive for some of our guests, but all the feedback is that it was well worth it for the amazing experience! I highly recommend SNOWY FUN for birthday parties, or just a visit for your family!"

There was no air filled balloons. 5. The kids were not offered boots for the snow room. Some kiddos left with wet feet.\n\nThe facility was clean, we at no point felt rushed, I was given a 10% off for the staff forgetting the throne."

The only minimal downside is that the snow room is REAL snow. Well. As real as it can artificially get lol its cold and wet and not very convenient with toddlers. We were not clothed appropriately though so thats our fault. We had just assumed it was all foam but this alternative is better. Great prices, great music and ambiance. The staff is all very sweet and the owner listens and cares about his customers. We threw our daughters birthday party here after visiting a few times and it was nearly perfect. Snags here and there but nothing that wasn’t fixed. Our party host was great at multitasking and helping us set up/run the whole party. Will definitely be back 😊"

It’s the cutest hidden gem!\nThe staff was friendly and helpful and we were impressed by the cleanliness and organization. You can tell they enjoy making a fun experience for the kids. We are excited to book my sons birthday here in a few months and share the experience with his school friends!"

We rented out the whole place and it was such a great value. We had two helpers to set up all the decorations as well as take them down. They also served the birthday cake, and boxed up all our leftovers as well. I didn’t have to lift a finger, which means I had time to mingle with the guests. Ari was one of their names, but they were both fantastic!  The owner was also very responsive to texts which helped with the planning as well.  The only improvement I would have would be the jump house slides are not smooth enough, I noticed many kids going down and hitting a rough patch on the slide and bouncing down. This was so minor, but just wanted to provide some feedback.  Everyone had so much fun especially in the snow room which the owner worked tirelessly to fix prior to our party! We are so grateful for that, and look forward to booking with them in the future!"

To my surprise, my daughter had a blast and talks about her birthday at Snowy Fun still!  The party rooms are the biggest we’ve had at a venue which I can appreciate because it’s not only the kids we are catering to, the kids’ parents also need a place to sit while the kids are enjoying their time. I have a few suggestions for party hosts and party structure to make the transition from one party to the next a lot smoother - 1) hosts should organize and plan ahead for each party and prepare supplies and utensils in advanced to avoid having to leave the room during the party causing delays. 2) if only there was a way to allow each party to separate into the trampoline and play area without having to mix in and share with turn crowd - similar to Pump it up’s technique to avoid chaos. Lastly, have an option for gratuity to add for party hosts during check out.  Overall, the owners are kind and accommodating and hopefully these recommendations are helpful and does not come off rude. We would return as the kids had so much fun there! We also appreciate not allowing older kids to jump with young kids because you know kids aren’t aware and don’t look out for the younger ones."

The staff at the front desk are the worst—extremely rude and unhelpful. If you ask them for anything, they act like they don’t care. Most of the arcade games are broken, making it a total waste of money. On top of that, there are no slides or proper play areas for kids. Don’t waste your time or money here!”"

We will definitely be back."

          "content": "The *worst* experience ever. Stay away!\nI am deeply disappointed and outraged by the treatment my husband and children received at Kids Mania Playground. When my husband took our kids there today, the staff didn’t stamp the children’s hands after signing the waiver because the employee responsible was too distracted with her headset. When they tried to leave, another employee rudely accused my husband of attempting to kidnap his own children, simply because they didn’t have stamps on their hands.\nInstead of handling the situation professionally, the employee used inappropriate language and demanded my husband show pictures of the kids to prove he was their father, threatening to call the police. When my husband stood his ground and insisted they call the police, the staff lied to the authorities, claiming my husband refused to show his ID when, in fact, she never asked for it—she only demanded pictures.\nThe situation escalated unnecessarily, and while the police eventually confirmed everything was in order after seeing the waiver and my husband’s ID, this ordeal happened in front of my young children. My 7-year-old was terrified and had a panic attack because of how traumatic this experience was.\nThis place is unprofessional, disrespectful, and downright negligent. I plan to pursue legal action over this incident. I strongly urge other parents to avoid this place at all costs—it’s not worth the risk of putting your family through such a horrifying experience."

          "content": "I am so confused by all of the four and five star reviews at this place. Any party I have been invited to at this location has been complete chaos. Kids running everywhere. It is so LOUD and very easy to lose track of a little one. At one point a crying child was lost and I helped them get to the desk so that someone could call for their parent over the PA. You couldn’t even hear the employee over the crowd. Luckily, the child ended up locating his mother.\n\nAnyhow, anytime I have gone, the majority of the games upstairs are all out of service.  I do not understand these facilities that are at least somewhat based on arcade games that never have their arcade games in working order.  The party rooms downstairs are also very cramped, so not great for larger parties. The food is fine. No complaints there.\n\nI asked a friend why she didn’t go with Urban Air or another venue, and I found out that these parties are way, way cheaper than the average party place, so that explains why people always book here.\n\nThe one plus of this place is that like Chuck E. Cheese, it does have the security measure where they check the stamp on the child’s hand and make sure it matches their adult companion before they allow you to exit.\n\nIf you’re looking for somewhere, comparatively cheap, where your kid can run around, and you don’t mind a bunch of chaos and broken games, this may be a great place for you! Personally, an invite to a party here always gives me major anxiety and I cannot wait to leave."

My kids didn't want to go into the Play Station at first due to the crowded kids and screaming volume, but when the crowd died down, they went in and enjoyed playing inside. The Play Station is just mainly elevated climbing and walking. Not a challenging obstacle course compared to Ninja Nation or Planet Obstacle.\n\nPricing:\nI paid $29 for my two kids to enter the building. I am assuming that's if they came to play in the climbing maze and not for the arcade. I then paid $20 each for two play cards for my kids to play in the arcade area. The games range from fifty cents to $3 each!  For the arcade, I am better off with the Summer Fun Pass with Chucky Cheese for the same games. The son's favorite arcade is Jurassic Park and it is $3 per game!\n\nFood:  My kids and I don't like the low grade American food here so the not allowing food inside makes it very inconvenient. It's not an ideal place to stay long for play and eat.\n\nNote: Kids who don't like loud noises shouldn't come here. It's very loud. My daughter doesn't like the screaming volume from the play area."
