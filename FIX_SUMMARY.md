# Fix Summary - Progress Message Issue Resolution

## Problem
The system was throwing an error when trying to update task status:
```
Error updating task 63b7b864-1c17-487d-922e-9b0b8c250284: {
  code: 'PGRST204',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: "Could not find the 'progress_message' column of 'scraper_task' in the schema cache" 
}
```

## Root Cause
The `updateTaskStatus` function in [scraperService.js](file://d:\DRM%20-%20LIFE\Bin%20Store\Backup%20-%202%20-%20with%20major%20update\Backup%20Scraping\Backend\services\scraperService.js) was trying to update a `progress_message` field that doesn't exist in the `scraper_task` table schema.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed `progress_message` Parameter
Updated the `updateTaskStatus` function signature from:
```javascript
async function updateTaskStatus(taskId, status, progress, errorMessage = null, additionalData = {}, progressMessage = null)
```
to:
```javascript
async function updateTaskStatus(taskId, status, progress, errorMessage = null, additionalData = {})
```

### 2. Removed All `progress_message` Field Updates
Removed all instances where the `progress_message` field was being set in the update data object.

### 3. Implemented Better Progress Tracking
Replaced the static progress messages with dynamic progress tracking based on:
- **Link Finding Progress**: Tracks based on how many locations have been processed from `total_selected_zip_codes`
- **Data Extraction Progress**: Tracks based on queue size and processed results count

### 4. Updated Task Creation to Include `total_selected_zip_codes`
Modified the task status updates to include `total_selected_zip_codes` in the additional data when appropriate:
```javascript
await updateTaskStatus(taskId, 'running', 15, null, { total_selected_zip_codes: locationQueue.length });
```

## Files Modified
1. [services/scraperService.js](file://d:\DRM%20-%20LIFE\Bin%20Store\Backup%20-%202%20-%20with%20major%20update\Backup%20Scraping\Backend\services\scraperService.js) - Main fix and progress tracking implementation
2. [test-progress-fix.js](file://d:\DRM%20-%20LIFE\Bin%20Store\Backup%20-%202%20-%20with%20major%20update\Backup%20Scraping\Backend\test-progress-fix.js) - Test script to verify the fix

## Verification
- ✅ No more `progress_message` field errors
- ✅ Dynamic progress tracking based on actual work completed
- ✅ Proper use of `total_selected_zip_codes` for progress calculation
- ✅ All database updates comply with the actual `scraper_task` table schema

## How Progress Tracking Works Now

### Link Finding Phase (Progress 30-45%)
- Tracks progress based on how many locations from `total_selected_zip_codes` have been processed
- Updates every 3 seconds with current progress

### Data Extraction Phase (Progress 50-85%)
- Tracks progress based on how many items have been processed from the shared queue
- Updates every 2 seconds with current progress

This provides more accurate progress reporting to users while eliminating the database schema error.
