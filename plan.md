# Plan to Create a Single JSON File for All States

The goal is to combine all individual state JSON files from the `utils/states/` directory into a single JSON file with a nested structure.


Here is the step-by-step plan:

1. **Identify State Files:** Get a list of all `*.json` files directly within the `utils/states/` directory. We will ignore the subdirectories for now.

2. **Initialize Combined Data Structure:** Create an empty JavaScript object that will hold the combined data. The structure will be:
   ```json
   {
     "stateName": {
       "countyName": {
         "cityName": ["zipCode1", "zipCode2", ...]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Process Each State File:** This step will be handled by the `all_states.js` script.
   - The script will iterate through each identified state JSON file.
   - For each file, it will extract the state name from the filename (e.g., `alabama.json` -> `alabama`).
   - It will read the content of the JSON file.
   - It will parse the JSON content to get the array of city names.
   - For each city, it will assume there is a corresponding `city.json` file in `utils/states/stateName/counties/cityName.json` (e.g. `utils/states/alabama/counties/Abbeville.json`). It will read the zip codes from this file. If the file doesn't exist, it will use an empty array for zip codes.
   - It will create the nested structure: state -> county -> city -> zip codes. Since county information is not available, it will assume each city is in its own county named after the city.

4. **Create the Final JSON File:** This step will be handled by the `all_states.js` script.
   - Once all state files have been processed, the combined data object will be complete.
   - The script will convert the JavaScript object into a JSON string.
   - The script will write this JSON string to a new file named `utils/all_states.json`.

5. **Scripting:** A Node.js script named `all_states.js` has been created to perform these actions.
